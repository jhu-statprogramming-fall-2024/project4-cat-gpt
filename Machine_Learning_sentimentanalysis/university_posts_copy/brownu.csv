Dear Brown Students: Who Among You Made a Global Impact Before Being Accepted?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1gvrt9r/dear_brown_students_who_among_you_made_a_global/,0,25,2024-11-20 15:17:41,"I came across a comment by a Reddit user who claimed to be a senior at your college. They argued that extracurricular activities done abroad are inherently more valuable than those done in one's own country. To illustrate, they suggested that reading books to children in Bosnia through the European Youth Corps holds more significance than my four years of teaching disadvantaged girls in Turkey, where access to education for girls is often limited.

Personally, I believe in following my heart. For me, dedicating four years to improving the lives of overlooked individuals, children, and animals within my own community -people I share a living space with- is far more meaningful than hopping on a plane just to impress admission officers I‚Äôll never meet.

The real question, in my opinion, isn‚Äôt about where or what you do‚Äîespecially since not everyone has the privilege of traveling abroad frequently‚Äîbut rather the impact you make, what it means to you, and the commitment you show. I don‚Äôt see either experience as inherently superior to the other. What do you think?"

Questions for Summer@Brown,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1go4mwb/questions_for_summerbrown/,4,3,2024-11-10 16:36:38,"Hi! I plan to apply for summer@brown for 2025 and had a few questions. If anyone has attended or know someone who has attended, feel free to answer some of my questions!

1. I plan to either take a creative writing class or acting class because those are two subjects that I thoroughly enjoy that aren't provided at school. But I've begun to think that maybe I should apply for a class that I will be taking in school next year that I think I will struggle in, just so I have a bit of background knowledge. I'll be in chemistry and college algebra next year, and science and math is typically harder for me. Would you recommend taking a class that I know I will have fun in, or taking a class that I may not as enjoy as much, but will benefit me in the long run?
2. I have major social anxiety and am worried about making friends. I've attended academic camps at other universities, but my first year I went with a friend and the second year I had friends from the previous year. At Brown, I won't know anyone and I am not sure I will be able to make friends easily. Are the people there typically very outgoing and friendly? Do you have any tips for getting out of my comfort zone and simply just introducing myself?
3. I am allergic to red meat (technically dairy too, but I still eat it), so my diet is restricted to a small amount of things. What do the meals typically look like at Brown? I am also a picky eater, but if they have chicken tenders I am set!
4. Are there any special events on campus? The previous camps I've been to host the ""Olympics"" over the weekend. A floor is divided into three teams and is assigned a country, we then compete in different events like musical chairs, Just Dance, relay races, and tug of war to determine who wins. It's an all day event and was one of the most exciting things at that camp. We also did this thing called ""Optionals."" Basically every evening you signed up for an activity such as kickball, friendship bracelet making, movies, etc. and then we went and did that activity for an hour and a half with a group of people. They also hosted an informal dance and the end of the camp and a banquet. I was just wondering if there's any similar events to those types of things.
5. I read that you can sign up to go on off-campus excursions on the weekends. Say I went to the mall on the weekend, do I have to stay with the group or can I just go off on my own with a couple of friends?
6. Are you allowed to leave campus? I know that there are specific excursions for the weekend, but during the week if I have spare time am I allowed to hop on a shuttle with some friends and go to the mall or a restaurant to eat? EDIT: I did watch a Day in My Life video and the girl went on multiple trips off of campus. She said she took uber, just wondering what other forms of travel there are.
7. What happens if I don't finish an assignment?
8. How far are the classes typically from where you eat and from dorm rooms? I have asthma and I just really hate walking, so I need to know how much I'll be walking every day so I can mentally prepare myself.
9. I know that people go to the library to work on homework and to study. But are you allowed to check out books? I have to take a plane to get to the campus and won't be able to pack a gazillion books. I do have a kindle that I'll most likely bring, although I do prefer reading physical copies of books. If they allow you to check out books then I won't even bother packing that many.
10. What are the bathrooms like? At the other camps I've been to you have a bathroom connected to your dorm, but it connects to another dorm as well so four people total share a bathroom, but you also have a sink in your personal room to get ready at. I read that bathrooms are communal, does this mean that I will be sharing with multiple girls? If so, should I bring a mirror so I can do my makeup and whatnot in my room? I know that there may be both girls and boys on the same floor, if bathrooms are communal, does that mean that I could be sharing a bathroom with boys as well?

I don't have any other questions that I can think of at the moment, but if I come up with any i will add them to this post.

EDIT:

11. How much money would you recommend bringing in cash? The vlogs I've watched of people going have gotten starbucks frequently, went to restaurants off-campus, went to the mall, did river boat tours, and even went ice skating. If I make friends that want to do some of these things or similar activities with me, I definitely will. I do have a debit card, and I know my mom would be willing to transfer some money onto it so I can do things, but I don't want to ask her for a ton of money because she's already paying for the actual camp. I have a bunch of cash, but don't necessarily want to bring it all.

12. The previous camp I went to covered all meal expenses. Are meals free on campus? Obviously food off campus will cost money, just wondering if I have to pay for every meal.

EDIT #2:

13. How early should I arrive for check-in? I saw a video and she said she arrived an hour later and wished she came like two hour BEFORE the check-in time. Are the lines really that long?

14. I live in the middle of the U.S so obviously the weather is very different from Rhode Island. What type of weather can I expect and what kind of clothes would you recommend bringing to accommodate the weather?

Also, sorry for all of the edits. I'm watching a bunch of vlogs because I'm excited for admissions dates to come out soon.

EDIT #3:

15. What does a typical day in the life look like for a student? I was under the impression that you had one class a day, but in a few videos people went to class in the morning and came back in the afternoon. If it usual to have more than one class a day?

EDIT #5:

16. I play the flute, violin, and piano. If I somehow manage to be able to transport them to campus, is there anywhere I can practice? Is there anywhere I can find a piano to play?"

I just got a flurry of emails telling me that i cannot sign up for classes next semester because i have an unpaid balance. for some reason, my school balance is at 28,000 which is more than what we pay per semester by a long shot. also, we *already paid* for this semester. i was on the phone with my dad when we paid for this semester, and as many financial aid kids can probably relate, i then panic checked the balance every couple days a few weeks after to make sure it was on zero and it was. apparently, my FAFSA wasn't submitted correctly (my dad didn't sign it correctly) and we are working to resubmit but that should have only cost us 7,000 right? why is my balance 28,000? and why now? it's been 2 months?? what is happening? I emailed several people who havent gotten back to me, aside from the bursar who sent me what could be an automatic email telling me to read their website. can anyone help or give advice? has this happened to anyone?"

We are honored to have Dr. Klaper, a renowned physician and speaker, to come to Brown and give a lecture about the importance of diet and nutrition in preventing diseases. 

Dr. Klaper will share his experience in practicing medicine for over 50 years with students, be it medical professionals or other undergraduate students and athletes. 

He has previously given a talk at Brown's medical school and will do so this time as well. 

In general, people go through 4 years of medical school, and nutrition is rarely brought up. There's a lot of misinformation around diets. As a cancer researcher and biomedical scientist, nutrition was never brought up in my education until I decided to study it myself.

I will be a college freshman in fall of 2025, and I am planning to apply to BrownU. My original plan was to major in Environmental Engineering and then see if I can minor in Computer Engineering.

So, do you think it would be possible to double major in two different Engineering concentrations since there will be overlap in their courses/requirements, or is that a death sentence? (I am assuming it‚Äôs death sentence and not advised, but I thought I would ask anyway).

Also, some follow up questions:

If you advise against double concentrating, do you have any ideas of what I can do instead?

How are the engineering concentrations at Brown? Do you feel like they prepare you for a career in engineering? I‚Äôve seen other people on this subreddit say that Brown‚Äôs engineering classes are more theoretical than practical. Can you guys give some insight into what that means exactly?"

Single Rooms for someone with a chronic illness? + Input from other physically disabled students about how Brown treats you?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1ffkd3i/single_rooms_for_someone_with_a_chronic_illness/,8,15,2024-09-13 02:42:32,"Hello! I'm a senior in high school trying to decide where to apply. I have multiple chronic conditions that would cause me to be unable to room with someone. I won't go into details but its severe enough that, despite people saying its important to have a roommate your Freshman year, I am confident that its not possible for me.

I've heard that (with a lot of paperwork) you can apply for a single with accommodations, but I had another question in addition to that. Are there floors with singles that have bathrooms that are single-use only? As in, you enter, lock the door, and then its just you? I have a medical reason for asking this.

Also, in the unlikely case I apply and then get accepted, apply for accommodations, then end up in a single, how much would my social life suffer? I would do my best to put myself out there.

Also also, if you're a chronically ill or physically disabled Brown student, how have you been treated? Is there an accommodations officer who will talk to professors if they don't accommodate you? And is the school generally a place where disabled students feel comfortable in terms of their classmates? Some people at the current school I go to stole my friend's cane and have fun laughing at me when I'm having a fainting spell. I'm not sure it could get much worse than that (at a college like Brown, at least), but I'd still like to ask.

Thank you for reading this, and I hope this doesn't sound too presumptuous. I'm not assuming I would get in, (the opposite, actually, since Brown is incredibly difficult to get into even if I have the grades), but if I do apply, I want to know in advance what it would be like. Thank you."

I'm an incoming first-year student trying to figure out course planning. I'm currently thinking of concentrating on Biology or cognitive science, but honestly not so sure (ngl almost an undecided concentration).

Though I've done my research on Brown's open curriculum, completed the online course on Canvas, and even looked through some of the advice on this Reddit community, I'm still not so sure if I'm on the correct track or have the right approach.

As I am not certain about my concentration, I do not want to strictly stick to one path and regret my choice in the future. So instead, I want to have as much experience as possible and explore different disciplines with Brown's open curriculum during my first year. However, at the same time, I do not want to fall too behind on my prerequisites for my potential concentration (which is biology) by taking whatever courses I want in my first semester, in case I come back to it.

If this is my case, should I take some prerequisite courses for biology in my first semester or can I slow down, explore various disciplines, and figure out what I want and then come back to it during my second semester or second year? Wonder if anyone in this situation or had experience with this. Thanks.

Reviewing First-year CS classes I took,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1eslzr3/reviewing_firstyear_cs_classes_i_took/,24,4,2024-08-15 04:12:05,"**CS15:** Introduction to OOP with Java, Prof. Andy Van Dam. **What I** ***think*** **the median grade was:** A

Probably the best class I've taken here so far. I had some basic programming exp coming in through high school (a very basic python course: conditionals, loops etc.), but I think you might fare better coming in fresh. CS15 flips the order of a traditional intro CS course by introducing classes, inheritance/polymorphism at the start and then transitioning into java syntax + simple DS and algorithms. I could write a python script here and there but never really felt comfortable with programming large applications until I took this course. The projects are definitely time-consuming, and the TAs are a little understaffed imo, but there's more than enough support to help you get through it. Everyone involved in this course makes the entire experience so engaging - definitely a must-take at Brown imo. 

A good bit of students drop out of this course halfway through after struggling with the projects. This is not a Brown problem, it's a you problem. CS15 is a really dense course, and you have to be willing to prioritize it in your course schedule. **Make an effort to understand all the content they throw at you, especially if you've never seen CS before** - go to TA hours to ask questions after class, ask in lecture, use Ed - so many resources. 

**CS200:** Data Structures and Algorithms, Prof. Kathy **What I** ***think*** **the median was:** low A/high B

This class begins by exposing the CS15 kids to the functional programming paradigm taught in cs17 and the 17 kids to OOP. We then spend most of the semester going over hashmaps, arraylists, cyclic arrays, stacks, queues, linkedlists, graphs, heaps, tries, trees etc. You don't really learn a lot of algorithms apart from implementing the basic tree/graph traversals. There's a focus on understanding design choices of why you would pick one data structure over the other, a lot of algorithmic time/space analysis, and some lower level content on garbage collection. 

Same jazz with the projects being incredibly time consuming but well resourced. This is a newer course and I still feel like they haven't gotten this one right yet. It's not bad by any means but the hiatus at the start to catch each cohort up with the other, and the random switch to python halfway through (which I think is solely to make students more industry-ready??) just detracts from what a 2nd sem course in CS should be - as much as DS and as much as algorithms as possible. You might want to take another algorithms course after this to supplement your understanding. 

Pick your project partners for this one wisely 

  
**CS220:** Discrete Structures and Probability (Math for CS) Prof Rob Lewis **What I** ***think*** **the median was:** low A/high B

Class is half proofs/logic and half statistics/probability. I *think* proofs don't really appear again unless you take CS1010, but I felt like it set me up with a strong foundation for pure math (which is very proof heavy). Uniquely, you use a programming lang called Lean to write out your proofs which gives you a more syntactical/regimented way of understanding proof/logic. The stats portion is likely smt you've seen before, but is introduced with more proofs. Content is littered with applicable examples to CS. You do your assignments in Latex - learning that is pretty cool too. 

Class feels kinda useless at the time but is a staple for any CS degree. Definitely more challenging than other 1st year classes and gives you a taste of what's to come. Dr. Lewis is kinda a dry lecturer but it's bearable. Don't skip classes - you will flunk the exams. "

Greek Life Update at Brown,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1emxvao/greek_life_update_at_brown/,43,4,2024-08-08 05:24:39,"Ive seen a lot of posts recently asking about greek life or theme programs at Brown. Since the vibes of frats change pretty frequently, I thought Id make an updated guide for anyone thinking about rushing and getting involved. If anyone is a part of any of these greek life orgs or if anyone has anything else to add, please do. This guide is to be used for just the overall vibe and presence on campus. Everyone definitely has their own personal experience of frats they like to be around or don't. Brown is not a party school, so greek life is not extremely popular. Many people have never even interacted with it either. But it is definitely one of many sources for partying or community for some people at Brown.

There are two main types of frats: On campus and off campus. On campus means the fraternity is recognized by the university as an organization at Brown and likely has a building on Wriston Quad dedicated for housing for its members. Off campus means the frat was once recognized by Brown, but was removed due to a violation of Brown policy.

I will start with off campus because there are less of them.

Sigma Chi (Sig Chi)- kicked off campus in 2019. The smaller and less popular of the two off campus frats. As of now, no official move to come back on campus has been made. Used to be a few decent invite only parties, but have recently began throwing open parties and off campus events at venues. One of the not lesser socially present frats. They were pretty dead for a while after getting kicked off, as no one trusted their events. Have been improving in recent years. If you have friends in the frat, you'll go to their events. Otherwise, you'll maybe hear about a couple of their events throughout each semester. Medium size rush class, not too competitive to get into cause of their off campus nature. I have heard some problematic things about the brothers from upperclassman, but seems to be dying down and becoming better.

Phi Kappa Psi (Phi Psi/Lantern)- kicked off campus in 2015. Currently the most active frat on campus in terms of number of events. Used to be the cool ""underground frat"". You had to know someone to get in and would never let in freshman to their events. Started to lose that vibe during the 2022/2023 year, and completely changed this past year. They let in a lot of new members these past two years, which has completely changed their dynamic. They are becoming more of an event throwing group. They constantly rent out bars and venues and throw open parties to anyone as long as you pay. They promote their venue parties all the time on here, Sidechat, and even posters around campus such as their spring weekend event. They do still have house parties, but they are no where as popular as their off campus events. They have had a major increase in freshman presence at parties, which caused them to be way more open to letting anyone in. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but they are no longer ""selective"" in everything they do. I have friends in it that say the brotherhood aspect is lacking due to their of campus nature. I started seeing way less upperclassman or maybe just so many more freshman. Somewhat competitive to get in. Still they give out lots of bids, but many people reject. Due to their openness, less people have found a reason to actually officially join and would rather just know someone and show up instead. More problematic things have been said about their brothers recently, but they tend to be chill and just guys looking for a way to party. They do not plan to come back on campus.

Now for the on campus frats. Many on campus frats also have an off campus house they party in. The main distinction people consider when joining an on campus or off campus frat is if they want to be able to live in housing with their brothers as early as sophomore year. Brown only lets you officially move off campus your senior year unless you have accommodations. There is also some roll over of juniors who get selected from a random lottery to live off campus. Many people say the brotherhood is tighter and more involved with each other between different year classes in on campus frats since so many of them live together. There is also the added benefit of being able to put greek life orgs on your resume and count it as an activity you are in only if they are on campus frats. This is especially helpful for greek life members who have leadership positions. This is not really a deal breaker for most people, but definitely matters for some.

Delta Tau (DTau)- known as the the chill frat. One of the other medium socially present frats on campus. They were known for decent parties, that would admit anyone in. Was not too competitive to get into. Started to get problematic, but has stopped as they changed around their vibe, their problematic members graduated, and the bad attention started getting directed to other groups. Have had some good things said about their new members. Lots of people that join are looking for a frat that isn't too serious, but still parties. This past year they seemed to switch directions. They are similar vibe to sigma, but on campus. They threw a lot of parties in the fall, and less in the spring. They did more venue events and small invite only house parties. Somewhat competitive to get in. They have a medium turn out for rush, but were tight with the number of bids these past years. Their brothers are tight and their new members seem to be focusing on improving the brotherhood.

Delta Phi (DPhi)- the LAX frat, but started admitting other members too. Sometimes known as the rich, white, coke, New York frat. Unfortunately, one of the most dying frats right now socially. They were super exclusive for so long, with invite only parties and tight with bids. This caused most people to not hear about anything they were doing. This combined with lots of sorority Dphi horror stories has made them completely forgotten about. Started opening up their parties to anyone, including renting out a venue, but still a weak turn out. Most people don't even know someone in Dphi, just that their brothers are problematic unless you are in greek life. This was a huge turn from my underclassman years, which they had some good events. Most people used to rush lantern, dtau, and sigma, but go to Dphi instead. Now the vibe has definitely shifted, as people that rush Dphi end up joining elsewhere. They still manage to pull members cause of LAX but are no longer the first choice. 

Theta Alpha (Thete)- the football and wrestling frat. If you are not on those teams, this frat isn't even on your radar. The frat has always just been used as a place for the football guys to have a building to themselves to chill at. If they throw parties, it is heard about as the football team is throwing, not thete.

Beta Omega Chi (BOX)- the African American/black frat. Has only 1-2 parties each semester, in their building lounge. Always a good time and super nice brotherhood. They do not serve alcohol at their parties as they are registered events with the university. Not really thought of as a traditional frat and more just a community, similar to the theme houses. Still whenever they throw, their parties always fill up and you can hear the speakers blasting on wriston until 2am.

Buxton International House- suspended in 2019 for a year but came back. Used to be just known for being rich and international. Have always been super selective. They have been constantly clowned on recently and have become the target of jokes. They threw some really bad events, have been known to have some mean stuck up members, and have become a big joke. They've charged people insane amounts of money for their parties this year, which is something they haven't done in a while.

Zeta Delta Xi (Zete)- the lgbtq+ frat. Admit everyone, very quirky, always have super funny and intriguing posters for their events. They still like to throw down in their basement lounges, but the vibe is not for everyone.

Alpha Delta Phi (ADPhi)- a literary society that's gender inclusive. Once again, not really a traditional frat. It is similar to professional frats at other schools (these are frats that focus on certain professions like engineering or business). They do small events for themselves, but don't throw parties.

Technology House (Tech House)- program theme housing focused on technology and is gender inclusive. Similar to ADPhi, but more focused on video games, board games, and other projects. Nerdy and don't throw parties, but nice people if you are in the scene. They were struggling with members for a while, but had a recent influx in people involved. Still not a traditional frat and more focused on community.

Which songwriting class to take,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1emcg15/which_songwriting_class_to_take/,13,4,2024-08-07 13:56:06,"I know I can shop both, but I'd like to know a bit more about MUSC 400B vs MUSC 450 beforehand. For some context, I'm a long time amateur violinist/singer with no intention of going professional or concentrating in music, who just wants to gain the necessary skillset+experience to create songs on my own and have fun at it. 

I have a soft spot for pop songs, so I was planning on shopping MUSC 400B, but heard it was more of a hardcore music theory class prepping for harder courses in the music concentration rather than a fun and un-stressful song-creating course. I don't know much about MUSC 450.

On the courseload advice posts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1ejuyzl/on_the_courseload_advice_posts/,40,6,2024-08-04 13:14:27,"Hey everyone;

With the incoming freshman class making their first seemster courseloads, we've seen an influx of posts along the lines of ""Is this courseload too ambitious"", or ""Please give me feedback on my courseload"".

These posts all have similar answers, summed up as such:
- Probably don't take 5 classes,
- Go on the critical review and add up the average hours,
- Try to take a fun course,
- CS19 is a lot of work,
- You should shop it and see what works for you,
- And, most importantly; I don't know, that depends on who you are and what you're used to.

I propose that we ban full ""courseload advice"" posts in favor of a collected thread with some of this general advice posted in it.  This would provide a place for standardized advice to be found (which is often the best that random reddittors can do anyway) while  making space for specific questions if needed. 

Most incoming freshmen don't talk to upperclassmen before coming in, and they're perfectly fine. It is also an important part of college and Brown to learn how to judge these things for yourself-- nobody's first semester goes perfectly, and that's okay. You'll learn a lot for the future.

Please note that this is not about specific course questions; sometimes the CR is lacking or you don't know anyone who has taken a particular course. That can be useful information even for upperclassmen.

Sincerely,
A Brown student"

AITA for TAing classes just to promote my music?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1ejg0oh/aita_for_taing_classes_just_to_promote_my_music/,42,13,2024-08-03 22:39:24,"I'm a 26-year-old indie singer-songwriter, and I have a bit of a dilemma. To be upfront, I haven't had much luck in the music world. I‚Äôve always made niche, esoteric songs, and I haven‚Äôt had many opportunities to meet A&R reps. I‚Äôm unsigned and my whole undergrad I could never get streams or get a record deal. Now that I‚Äôm a grad student I‚Äôm gonna try to change things up. I‚Äôm going to be TAing some undergrad classes in the fall, primarily to meet prospective young listeners and see if anything might develop after the semester ends.

I know this sounds bad, but I don't plan on abusing any power dynamics or grading unfairly. My intention is primarily to put myself out there and maybe get my new 'song of the summer' to go viral. I genuinely enjoy teaching and helping students understand the material, so it's not like I'm ONLY using the role to promote my self-produced four-song EP.

Some of my friends know about my intentions and think it's incredibly unethical. They argue that it's a clear abuse of power dynamics, even if I wait until the semester is over. They believe that as a TA, my focus should solely be on my academic responsibilities, not on using the position to beg Annabel Zimmer for nepo favors.

I understand where they're coming from, but I feel like as long as I'm not mixing my professional and musical lives during the semester, there's no harm in trying to sneak one of my songs onto someone's workout playlist after the course ends. I'm not looking for any ""quid pro quo"" or to leverage my position in any way.

The idea is just that my raw vocals and candid lyricism will shine through when I‚Äôm at the front of the classroom, and labels will finally start to notice me. My whole undergrad they only wanted sexy popstar. Maybe now that they see how tortured and emotionally vulnerable I am in the classroom they‚Äôll finally start wanting to sign me.

So, I guess, AITA for TAing classes with the primary intention of promoting and potentially playing my music out loud during review sessions?"

Also, as I was planning out my potential schedule, I noticed that the MWF classes are placed 10 minutes apart. Is it generally advised for me to not take 2 classes back to back with 10 minutes in between, or is it enough to get halfway across campus?

Computational Biology + Pre-Med Course Selection (help a confused freshman!),https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1ecyjwu/computational_biology_premed_course_selection/,2,4,2024-07-26 20:49:08,"Hi everyone!

I'm currently trying to plan out my course load for the fall semester (and a little bit beyond) and really want to make sure to knock out any important classes that I'd need to take early on for my intended concentration (comp bio) or that I'd need for the MCAT, if I decided to go pre-med.

I'm confused about one aspect of the computational biology Sc.B. degree, which is the courses that I can take if I decided to focus on the biological sciences track. Essentially, the website says that I'd need to complete ""At least four courses comprising a coherent theme in one of the following areas: Biochemistry, Ecology, Evolution, or Neurobiology"" in addition to some other required courses. I'd be interested in taking neurobiology courses but am wondering what exactly qualifies as ""coherent theme"" for neurobiology. If anyone is specifically focusing on neurobiology for their comp bio degree, what classes did you take/are you taking to fulfill that part of the requirement?

Would classes like NEUR 0010, 1020, or 1030 count? Or would they need to be more upper level, or have ""neurobiology"" specifically in the name?

Could I argue that classes like BIOL 0500 & 0800 could also fall into the theme of neurobio, (catering more to the bio, obviously) or would that be too much of a stretch? Since BIOL 0500 & 0800 (cell/molecular bio and physiology) would be useful for the MCAT, I'm just trying to see if there's any way to have my classes count both towards the neurobiology requirements for the comp bio major AND towards medical school/MCAT.

We have exciting news! Instead of a set stipend for required books and supplies, Brown will cover the cost of all your required books and supplies purchased at the Brown bookstore. We have estimated a cost of $1300 for annual books and supplies, and will adjust this according to actual costs. This is in addition to the amount stipulated in your financial aid award letter, which is for discretionary books and general educational supplies. Any educational costs beyond your Family Responsibility that are listed on your Financial Aid Eligibility letter will be covered by University Scholarship.

A few months back, I reached out to a professor via email about an internship opportunity. After some rescheduled meetings, we finally had a Zoom call where he set up a virtual program with one of his postdocs. We also talked about the possibility of an in-person internship. I tried contacting the postdoc to join the virtual program but got no response.

I followed up with the professor again to get details about the in-person internship because I needed to plan living arrangements and coordinate with my high school. After several emails, he randomly sent info about the virtual program instead, which was confusing. He copied the postdoc, who finally responded and added me to the mailing list, but I haven't heard anything since. I tried reaching out to the postdoc again, but no luck.

Now that summer's almost over, I reached out to the professor once more about the in-person internship details but I haven't received any responses yet.

I haven't been bombarding them with emails‚Äîif I don't hear back within a week, I send a single follow-up and leave it at that.

I get they're busy, but it's been months since we started discussing this, and I still don't have any information or a chance to start working. I'm willing to wait, but with summer ending soon, it'll be hard to do everything before school, and setting something up during the school year will be even harder, especially without any specifics, hours, start or end dates, or anything really.

I really don't want to give up on this cuz its a great opportunity, so any advice on what I should do next?"

Congrats on committing to Brown! You‚Äôre about to become part of a truly special campus. Here are some things I learned over my first year or wish I knew going into my freshman year.

# Matriculation

Brown sends out info late relative to other schools. You will probably find out about where you‚Äôre living and what classes you‚Äôre taking after many of your friends do. If you feel like you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, that‚Äôs ok. **Read closely through** [**the first-year checklist**](https://orientation.brown.edu/before-you-arrive)**.** The admissions office won‚Äôt always usher you through the steps you need to take to matriculate.

Do the First Readings! Yes, they are long. Yes, it‚Äôs summer. If they seem uninteresting to you, you are one of the people who most need to read them. No one will make you prove that you read them, but they offer valuable context on the environment that you‚Äôll soon live in. Brown‚Äôs history spans multiple centuries, which brings the prestige that likely drew you to the university, but also brings baggage that we have an obligation to confront.

# Housing

There are basically no bad first-year dorms. You will be fine wherever the lottery places you. In Keeney? Getting to the Ratty will be convenient. You might catch the Keeney cough, but at least you get a cute quad to live on. Get New Pem? Many people will react with gasps and condolences, but, having lived in NP4, I beg to differ. New Pem is super close to the Nelson (gym), Andrews (a dining hall and dorm), and VDub (Verney-Wooley Dining Hall). You also get semi-private bathrooms. It‚Äôs certainly less cushy than the Andrews dorms, but New Pem is far greater than the sum of its parts. The same location perks go for the other North Campus dorms like Emwool (Emery-Wooley) or Mochamp (Morriss-Champlain).

More info on New Pem 4 because that‚Äôs where I lived:

* You live on Thayer Street. Though that brings some conveniences (quite literally‚Äîthere‚Äôs a convenience store right across the street), Thayer is loud. Motorcyclists, cars blasting music, and street drummers can sometimes make it tough to study or sleep, but you get used to it fast.
* The trash is outside. Find the door labeled TRASH ROOM on the street level of NP1.
* Laundry access is outside. Find the glass-paneled door on the street level of NP4.
* Room size is largely the same, but some rooms have amenities like skylights or a balcony.
* The kitchen is a little dingy but everything works. Do not be the person who calls maintenance when you don‚Äôt see flames coming from the range. The range is electric.
* The lounge gets hot and humid in the summer. Propping open one or both doors is not great adherence to the fire code, but makes it inhabitable.

# Dining

I won‚Äôt say which dining hall is best because opinions tend to vary wildly. Food at Brown is always edible, sometimes great, and sometimes just ok. You‚Äôll find something you enjoy, whether it‚Äôs a late-night burger with onion rings at Jo‚Äôs (Josiah‚Äôs), the pasta station at the Ratty (the Sharpe Refectory), or bowls from Wok at Andrews.

If you eat a lot and/or like to have 3 meals each day, go for the 20/week plan. If you‚Äôre an athlete or hungry person, that‚Äôs probably the better plan for you. If you like snacking, can have 2 big meals one day and 5 small meals the next, the Flex plan might be better for you. If you get Flex, be conscious of how fast you‚Äôre spending your points. You don‚Äôt want to end the year with a surplus you don‚Äôt know how to get rid of or too few points to plan your meals comfortably.

# Socializing, Amenities, and Providence

Brown puts together an event-packed orientation week that you can get as involved in as you‚Äôd like. It‚Äôs easy to get tired and check out, but do try to go to as much as possible. At events like the ice cream social or midnight organ performance, you'll find a group to keep you company and help you settle into college life before you find the people that you‚Äôll want to spend much of your year with (though it might be the same people!). Go to events with your roommate if you want company, but definitely don‚Äôt shy away from going to events alone. Most people are entering Brown without friends on campus and will be just as alone as you. Make the most of your time. If a trip to Newport with new friends sounds more valuable than the silent disco, go to Newport!

In my experience, people make friends in their dorms, in extracurriculars, in class, or at social functions (basically, everywhere). **Join a club. Join 3 clubs. Join 5 clubs and drop a couple because 5 is too many for your first year.** A regret I heard from a number of peers is that they didn‚Äôt get involved enough. With all of the stress of settling in, it‚Äôs easy to fall into an attending class/hanging out/studying routine. Joining clubs early will expose you to upperclassmen and like-minded people and will set you up to have a valuable freshman year. Go to the club fair and give your email to clubs that are even minorly interesting to you.

As a college student, how you spend your time is entirely up to you. Curate a class schedule that lets you live the lifestyle you want. You might want to pick a day/set of days where you have no classes if you like to run errands and study on a dedicated day (or do an internship). You might prefer to have an even courseload across each day. Regardless, keep yourself busy. You will regret not taking advantage of your first year. Get a campus job (more info on that below), work out at the Nelson, go to events on campus (There are so, so many events. Check department websites for what‚Äôs coming up and join their mailing lists. Read through Today@Brown daily (an email newsletter that all students get) and go to as many events as you can.), join a club, or explore Providence. Manage your time wisely and make your first year fun.

You might not have been thrilled about the city surrounding Brown. Providence is definitely not New York or LA, but it won‚Äôt matter too much. Unless your social group goes out often, you‚Äôll be spending much of your time on College Hill. Dalliances to Providence, for many, will be limited to occasional weekend outings, studying at the RISD library, and changing buses at Kennedy Plaza (RIPTA is free for you as a Brown student; definitely take full advantage of this).

# Financial Aid & Working at Brown

Some tips for folks on financial aid: Brown doesn‚Äôt automatically give you federal student loans. If you want a federal subsidized/unsubsidized loan, you have to manually request it through Banner Self-Service. Also, if you got financial aid, you are in the BCMS program. This means that all of your textbooks assigned for classes are free. BCMS will send you an email saying that you have mandatory BCMS training, but since that didn‚Äôt work for me last year, know the following things:

1. When you‚Äôre ordering books on the bookstore website, *never* put in payment information. You do not need to submit a credit/debit card number. Select the option that lets you enter your Banner ID (starts with a B), and that‚Äôll charge your account. BCMS can then reimburse you.
2. You own the textbooks you get from the BCMS program. This means that you can do whatever you want with the books, except use the bookstore buy-back program.
3. If you drop a class that BCMS covered materials for, you must return those materials to the bookstore.

If work-study was part of your financial aid package, you‚Äôll likely want to get a job. Google ‚Äúbrown workday‚Äù to get to Workday. Workday sucks. In Workday find ‚ÄúStudent Job Hub.‚Äù You‚Äôll want to apply to a wide set of jobs because many won‚Äôt respond, especially if you‚Äôre an international student. Not all jobs pay the same and not all have the same commitment level. Pick jobs that look good to you and apply early. Because, as aforementioned, Workday sucks, you‚Äôll have to enter the same information manually for each application. I recommend making a doc with your responses to every field so that you can rapid-fire-paste your responses.

# The Open Curriculum

Though I had professed my deep love for the Open Curriculum in my Common App, when it came time to select classes, I still didn‚Äôt have a solid answer for a big question: ‚ÄúWhat does the Open Curriculum mean for me?‚Äù

For the most part, the Open Curriculum means that you‚Äôre responsible for planning your time at Brown. Unlike at many other schools, you‚Äôre on the hook for putting together a set of classes that lets you graduate with the concentration(s) of your choice. If you‚Äôre a pre-med or engineering student, this is especially important for you. Because your path has a lot of concentration requirements and courses that need to be in sequence, you‚Äôll have less opportunity to take advantage of the Open Curriculum. If you‚Äôre an English concentrator, you have fairly few concentration requirements and have to figure out how to fill most of your time at Brown. This is an equally challenging situation, and you might feel overwhelmed by the number of paths that you can take.

Regardless of which end of the spectrum you fall on, take advantage of the Open Curriculum. Being a CS concentrator who has academic experience with chemistry or an Econ concentrator with sociology experience can set you apart in the job market and enrich your time at Brown.

Many first-years decide early that they want to double-concentrate. I am guilty of this. Know that double concentrating will leave you with a good number of course requirements and limit your ability to take advantage of the Open Curriculum. Think deeply about whether it‚Äôs important to you to graduate with a second concentration or if taking a varied selection of classes in a second area of focus is enough.

**The gist here is**: plan your curriculum in broad strokes so you can succeed within your chosen concentration but don‚Äôt plan too specifically. Leave yourself the flexibility to explore topics that become interesting to you over your time at Brown.

   * **BrownU App** (dining menus, building hours, tons of info)
   * BrownRec (register for group fitness, see how busy the gym is)
   * Canvas (assignments)
   * **CSC Go** (Laundry)
   * **Duo Mobile** (logging into Brown services)
   * GroupMe (you‚Äôll likely have a dorm chat)
   * Kanopy (free movies through your Brown ID)
   * NYT and WSJ (you get access with your Brown ID)
   * **TransLoc** (See where the Brown University Shuttles are)
   * Wolfram Alpha (you get access with your Brown ID)
* Colosseum and Ego are probably the most popular clubs to go to. Ego is 18+ on Thursdays.
* There are a lot of Brownisms that you‚Äôll pick up over time. Here are some:
   * Smitty B = Smith Buonanno Hall
   * MoChamp = Morriss-Champlain
   * EmWool = Emery-Wooley
   * VDub = Verney Wooley
   * The Rock = John D. Rockefeller Library
   * The Hay = John Hay Library
   * SciLi = Sciences Library
   * APMA = Applied Mathematics
   * IAPA = International and Public Affairs
* You now have access to eduroam. This means that you have free wifi at many educational institutions. On Brown wifi, you get automatically logged into academic journals and databases. Eduroam lets you access all of Brown's resources even when you're at another educational institution.
* BruKnow is Brown's library search tool. It works incredibly well and can help you find books, articles, and archives available to you.

Tips for Dining @ Brown,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1ddthrp/tips_for_dining_brown/,57,15,2024-06-12 00:21:20,"Hi again rising first-years, and all community members!

Here are some quick tips I picked up. I definitely don't know all the best hacks for each dining hall so please leave a comment if you have any good ones that I missed.

1. Save your real-food-money for the harder half of the semester. Money can't buy happiness but it can get you a 2:00 a.m. burrito from Baja's. Which is the same thing, anyways.
2. Get¬†in the free food groupchat so you can descend like a hawk on any free food drops--look out for those random pizza spawns around campus.
3. You will download the BrownU app and check the dining hall menus and open hours. Dining halls will appear to be closed. They are most likely not closed, the app is usually wrong. You will learn dining hall hours with time.
4. Do you enjoy wasting money? Go with the 20 swipes weekly meal plan! This way, you get LESS flex points (the closest thing to real money you can get), you are limited to 4 swipes per daylight cycle, and all your leftover swipes disappear at the end of the week. (Right back into You-Know-Who's wallet.) Congratulations! Idiot.
5. The Ratty: Maturity is realizing that the Ratty is the best dining hall on campus. Open seven days a week, from pretty-early morning to way-too-early evening, the Ratty offers pretty much everything you could ever want. Have at it.
6. The Ivy Room: Right under the Ratty, literally! Ivy Room smoothies can get you through a week easy.
7. Theft: I can't legally endorse pocketing small items from The Ivy Room, Jo's, and The Blue Room. But I did hear from someone somewhere that Brown includes the expected cost of this activity in your bill anyways. So is it really theft?
8. Andrews: The mostest bestest quality food on campus on average. Gets old fast. Bleh¬†pizza, solid grinders (sandwiches), good East Asian-inspired bowls. Burrito bowls on the weekends! The Brown dining hivemind congregates here on salmon and pho nights as well. Expect queues of 70-80 people during busy times - arrive either early or late to avoid the line. Or, use your new Brown networking skills and strike up a conversation with your ""friend"" who just happens to be at the front of the line.
9. Double swipes are king and Andrews doesn't make you do that gross ReusePass thing. Get a bowl for today and a bowl for tomorrow! 
10. See all those chips at Andrews? They're free. Remember this the next time you want to spend money at a vending machine.¬†
11. Gourmet-To-Go: The most underrated not-a-dining-hall dining hall. Any snack or small meal you could want. Only takes Flex Points, Bear Bucks, or your real money. Grab a Hot Pocket, protein bar, or an energy drink. Great for getting through your boring lectures.
12. The Blue Room. Almost heaven. The real reason you wake up in the morning. Pastries of every kind. Muffins, croissants. Coffee. CLIF bars.¬†And the Bacon Egg and Cheese Sandwich. So much joy for so few Flex Points.¬†But be careful. After you buy 35 Bacon Egg and Cheeses in 35 consecutive weekdays, you will not have any more Flex Points. And you will be sad.
13. Save Your Flex Points: The reason the Flex plan is the only real dining option. Flex points can be used at vending machines, Gourmet to Go, and the Blue Room. The vending machines in Page-Rob have those AMAZING Milano cookies. Machines outside VDub and Jo's have ice cream. Don't blow all your Flex Points in one month, or you will be sad.
14. Jo's: The earlier you get to Jo's, the better the food, the cleaner the dining hall, the more options you have (quesadillas, paninis, sundaes, and JO'S GRILLED CHEESE!!), the better your sleep schedule, the less alcoholics/stoners you will run into, and the more your digestive system will like you. But you will learn that Jo's really hits at 1:49 A.M. when you and your big back get the seventh spicy with of the week. Put some Jo's sauce on that bih, grab some chips because the fries are stale and soggy, and eat your way out of your misery. That is Dining @ Brown.

The Best Freshman Dorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1d76uhx/the_best_freshman_dorm/,37,19,2024-06-03 15:13:25,"Hello rising first-years! Welcome to Brown‚Äôs residential ‚Äúexperience.‚Äù I wanted to give my take on the best dorms for frosh and why, and also open up a space for questions.

1. Emery-Woolley / Morriss-Champlin
2. Andrews
3. Keeney / Miller / Metcalf
4. New Pembroke 1-4

Here is why:
Cons: New Pem looks like a penitentiary on the inside and out. There are no elevators (have fun moving in to the fourth floor!), the lounges are literally smaller than your room, 8 people per bathroom, have to walk outside to get food.
If you do get New Pem you should consider reporting ‚Äúwater damage‚Äù as soon as possible and saving yourself the pain

Pros: you will maybe have a single

Andrews, Miller, Metcalf
Andrews has nice rooms, nice kitchens, cool lounges with big windows (and fucked up furniture), and YOUR OWN SINK INSIDE YOUR ROOM!!! Even better, you can take the elevator downstairs to Andrews (the dining hall) which has the most consistently good food you can get with your overpriced meal swipes. You don‚Äôt have to go outside while it‚Äôs raining for the 17th day straight. You want something from the Coke Freestyle machine? Right there.
Cons: A floor shares the bathrooms, and a little flooding here and there

Miller and Metcalf are connected to Andrews so you get a similar benefit.

Can‚Äôt speak much on Keeney.

Cons: Flooding. You share your bathroom with your whole floor.
If you do end up in Keeney, maybe specifically Everett-Poland‚Ä¶make sure to lock your dorm door behind you!

Actually, do that no matter where you live. There are stories.
Pros: Good facilities, bike room (I think), some treadmills attempting to be a gym, great location by the main green and the Ratty, great lounges. Best rooms. If you‚Äôre lucky maybe you‚Äôll end up in the 300-something square foot Arch-Bron private hotel room. All while paying the same for room and board as your friend in that fourth floor New Pem double. Maybe you‚Äôll even get a nice dingle (double with a lil privacy dividing wall) or single. 
Most likely, you‚Äôll end up in a double or triple and it‚Äôll be ehh, okay. But you have to share your bathroom with a bunch of slobs who won‚Äôt clean up their bodily fluids.

Which is what brings us to the BEST freshman dorm(s): Emery-Woolley and Morriss-Champlin. Rooms are solid and feel spacious if you know your feng shui. Worst case you get a triple, sucks but still a good deal. Five people share a bathroom at most, and maybe you‚Äôll be lucky and get a single/live next to a single. Three people, one toilet! Maybe it‚Äôs not your pristine master bathroom at home but you‚Äôre living good.

People will use your toilet if yours is nearby and theirs is occupied. Just let them, it‚Äôs not that deep. 

FURTHER! You live on top of VDub which means you can obtain sustenance (during the week) without having to even leave the building. Vending machine game is strong. Meh lounges (much better in MoChamp) and good location. 

Mostly wins all around. You don‚Äôt get to pick your dorm, but you can choose special interest housing, which is guaranteed? not to be in the same place it was last year. May the odds be ever in your favor.

Also, freshmen, you will want to collect as many fans as possible at the beginning of the semester. Your dorm does not have A/C and it will feel like it was built with the intention of roasting little freshmen alive. 

Give it two weeks, once September‚Äôs through you‚Äôll wish it was warm outside again.

Okay that‚Äôs all. Let me know what you think and if you agree with me, or ask any questions you have."

brown vs stanford help!,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1d5oqkh/brown_vs_stanford_help/,17,25,2024-06-01 14:53:21,"hi everyone! i only have until sunday to decide (and i get how obnoxious it is that i‚Äôve been stressing over this), but i was lucky to be admitted to both stanford and brown and was wondering your thoughts on which i should pick! for context, im planning on majoring in sociology and either computer science or econ.

some of my pros for stanford:
- probably the best computer science program worldwide if i end up deciding to do cs
- they have some super cool research opportunities for undergrads in sociology that i‚Äôve seen posted on the soc website!
- quarter system, so i could take more classes (but maybe also a con: i‚Äôm a little nervous about ending school a month later than most other people, socially and internship-wise)
- marginally better name (for whatever that‚Äôs worth)
- california (yesssss sun)

and some pros for brown:
- open curriculum, so i could take literally whatever classes i want!
- i‚Äôve seen online that brown is much more undergrad focused than a lot of other top schools, which i really appreciate
- i could double major much more easily (i think) than at stanford
- i‚Äôm more interested in the quantitative/research side of sociology, and they have a concentration called social analysis & research that seems perfect for me
- providence was so cute when i visited and i loved campus

and finally some of my concerns:
- i‚Äôm a little worried about stanford‚Äôs duck syndrome and imposture syndrome (already having a little bit of it even just for being admitted)
- i‚Äôm worried about the weather in providence bc i‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs usually pretty rainy constantly and super dark in the winter
- i would like to have the ability to explore a city. i also really want to have the ability to see live music, and i‚Äôve already been looking up concerts near both schools and they‚Äôre all either in san francisco or boston. so can anyone speak to how often they get off campus to go to the city/see live music?

i‚Äôm probably forgetting something too, but if anyone has advice i‚Äôd appreciate it so much!!"

I love Brown because of the open curriculum and the collaborative over competitive nature but I really enjoy Columbia‚Äôs rigor and how I get pushed into becoming the best. I also like how Columbia is in NYC (I‚Äôm NYC born and raised) but with Columbia the core curriculum might stop me from pursing international relations (even as a minor/concentration) because of all the classes I need to take to fulfill the core. 

Help me pick!! I need to decide asap by the end of may. Any advice would be appreciated! "

For reference, I have very minimal physics experience (took regular HS physics in 11th grade and I'm about to graduate HS) but it was really negative since I feel like we were just given a bunch of formulas without any intuitive explanation of any of the concepts whatsoever. For reference I've taken Calc 1-3, linear algebra and Real/Complex Analysis, so I have a very rigorous math background, but I've wanted to get into physics forever. I'm taking a gap year so I'm looking to self-study AP Physics C, but all the textbooks I find are, sorry to say it, long and boring, with almost no derivations of any of the formulas. What I'm looking for is a textbook that covers roughly the same concepts as an AP Physics C/first course in Mechanics and Electrodynamics using Calculus, but that \*proves\* all of its results. In other words, I want a textbook that will leverage my math knowledge and experience to help me learn physics, and was wondering whether anyone had any ideas :)

I already have a masters from a well-reputed UK university but it's in LEP

I'm interested in the following modules : -  
1. PHYS 2100 - General Relativity

2. PHYS 2300 - Quantum Theory of Fields I

3. PHYS 2320 - Quantum Theory of Fields II

6. PHYS 2620G - The Standard Model and Beyond

Am I right in understanding that these would run every year? I'm required to take 8 courses over 2 years (2-2-2-2). Some of these will be core-courses. How frequently have people been able to skip these core courses? 

Have I missed any courses you think should be in my interest?

What's the odds of being able to complete this program in lesser time (1 year)? Is it easy enough as a request or will I be at the behest of the administration?

I'm interested in pursuing a PhD after this. What percentile of Brown ScM physics graduates get a PhD in 1 or 2 years after their degree? Is it possible to find this information online? Some statistics would help.

Are there any international student scholarships I should look out for to minimize the cost? Any opportunities for TA'ing classes and other opportunities to make some money and build a CV?

Brown vs Berkeley (grad),https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1chutvj/brown_vs_berkeley_grad/,11,11,2024-05-01 19:25:48,"Hi, I was admitted to Brown‚Äôs ScM in CS and Berkeley‚Äôs MEng in EECS programs, and I‚Äôm currently having a tough time deciding. My main perspective on grad school was essentially an extension of my time in college, since I had a bad time during undergrad with no social life and I‚Äôm soon graduating with a bunch of acquaintances but zero close friends. I‚Äôve been actively trying to change that and improve myself for the future, and I hope that it works out well for grad school, so that‚Äôs definitely one of my main priorities. But, other factors like cost, opportunities, etc also exist, albeit not of the upmost importance. The list below is loosely ranked in terms of what I prioritize, and I‚Äôd love to hear what others think!

**Community/student life:**

* Berkeley: Large school, but more cut-throat/competitive? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard about UG, but not sure about grad. The MEng program is also more involved, which is great, but I‚Äôm more interested in interacting with the entire student body rather than being stuck in the smaller program of all older grad students (I graduated as a junior, so I'm a bit younger, but I‚Äôll also be a grad student so I‚Äôll be old no matter what :/)
* Brown: more friendly/laid-back environment. Seems more inviting, especially if the entire student body is seen as a whole, as opposed to undergrad vs grad, but I might be wrong about that
* I‚Äôm more interested in being a normal student and don‚Äôt care as much as other grad students about their studies. I‚Äôm also Asian, so that‚Äôs a factor for me as well. Both places seem great for that

**Program:**

* Berkeley:¬†
   * 1 year (don‚Äôt really want to be grinding out schoolwork for too long), but much more intensive (3 courses + capstone/semester). I‚Äôd like to have more free-time for other things
   * The choices for CS courses seem to be better and the program includes leadership/business courses, which are definitely more interesting than all CS courses.
* Brown:¬†
   * 1.5-2 years, only 2 courses/semester, more relaxing, which makes it more enticing. The 2 years allows me to do internship and stay on campus longer
   * CS catalog seems pretty mid tbh, and the school is focused more on UG, not masters. Also is a pure CS program, so no leadership/business :(

**School/Name:**

* Berkeley: top CS. also it‚Äôs in cali, never been there so experiencing cali weather would be nice
* Brown: lower CS, but Ivy name is cool to have. northeast weather sucks tho

**Job prospect/opportunities:**

* Berkeley:
   * MEng placement was 90% FAANG+ (tho this was for 2022, so it‚Äôs definitely not as high anymore)
* Brown
   * Slightly worse maybe? I read that 1/3 of CS grads go to FAANG (sorry if you‚Äôre annoyed by FAANG, it‚Äôs just a metric I use). This was for UG, so it might not be the same for masters. Maybe masters @ brown is just a cash cow fluke and might not be as great
* I‚Äôm planning on doing a startup after school, so doing full-time after school isn‚Äôt a priority. I‚Äôm leaning towards Brown since the 2 year structure allows me to get a good internship so that I don‚Äôt need to worry about post-grad employment (I'm mostly looking for the name on the resume and experiencing big N). But if things don‚Äôt go as planned, I‚Äôll probably do full-time for a bit, and then do my own thing after

**Entrepreneurship:**

* Berkeley: definitely better since it‚Äôs in Cali, and the MEng program is more centered on leadership/business, which is better. Better school for entrepreneurship too
* Brown: Not as much activity, but opportunities exist. Nelson center doesn‚Äôt sound too bad.¬†
* Imo the location isn‚Äôt too big of a deal, rather more about the school, but ig it‚Äôs also what you make of it

**Cost:**

* Berkeley: $50k tuition
* Brown: $80k tuition
* Cost isn‚Äôt too concerning for me, but I‚Äôll probably be looking for TA/RA opportunities. Berkeley sounds too busy/intensive to be doing any of those (i heard the opportunities are also extremely hard to get), and I‚Äôm not too sure how competitive it is at Brown for master‚Äôs students to get TA positions, let alone RA stipends.¬†

This list is a bit messy and definitely not fully fleshed out, but I hope it‚Äôs outlined my perspective better. Any general advice is also really appreciated!"

Stronger name for Grad School (Just in case I change careers + I won‚Äôt have to explain Columbia as much as Brown to people)  
My mom lived in & loves NYC and we have plenty of friends/family nearby  
More rigorous school (I think)  
(Slightly) less cold (I didn't know how much of a factor this would be until I visited >-<)  
‚ÄúStress Culture‚Äù  
More competitive (I like competition, as long as it's not toxic)  
Graduate focus  
Similar Cost to Brown (\~3-4k a year)

BROWN:

Campus/People feels too similar to my high school (I might want something different for a change)  
Way more grade inflation  
Open Curriculum is pretty nice  
Still has a strong name  
Safer than NYC (I don't mind too much considering where I grew up)  
‚ÄúHappy Ivy‚Äù  
More collaborative  
Undergraduate focus  
Similar Cost (without the stipend)

I got into the Presidential Scholars Program

Very Small program \~15 a year  
Stipend for 2 years + Research Funding  
Private Study Space in the Library  
Paid Summer Research for 2 years with Brown Faculty or another underpaid program  
First pick of faculty research  
Workshops & Meetings 1-2 a week with faculty (for the first year and less frequent) for the second  
Faculty and Student Mentors

Cost is not an issue for me since my mom has some saved up and these schools (thankfully) cost so little to me. What else am I not considering and should consider? I would also like to talk to a current Brown premed student about their experiences if possible.

Thank you so much!"

Cost will not be a differentiator between these two. I'm international and haven't had the chance to visit in person

Brown 

Pros:
- Open curriculum; given my interests (aside from econ, very humanities-inclined) I would likely benefit from having a core-less and flexible environment
- I'm super passionate about art, and Brown is close to RISD ü§£
- Reputed for being a generally happy university (I'm lumping grade inflation under this) 
- Providence sounds quite lovely

Cons: 
- Facilities and food have been found wanting??? 
- I'm planning on pursuing finance - not too pressed about recruiting and placement as I may not seek out work in the US, but wondering if Brown's comparatively laid back culture takes away from career prep 
- Have heard some things about prevalent 'woke' /cancel culture. 

Cornell

Pros:
- Better for econ and finance. I didn't apply to Dyson though. There's also a minor in History of Capitalism I'm interested in ü§î
- Bigger, but not huge. Potentially more diverse in terms of people and opportunities (both career-wise and in general) 
- I'm enchanted by the prospect of exploring gorges and waterfalls... I'm not the Most outdoors girlie but I do love me some nature. 
- Have heard more about Cornell's (more expansive?) alum network as a pro of attending, compared to Brown

Cons: 
- It is colder... Not a deal breaker, but I grew up somewhere pretty warm
- Rumored to be more stressful and depressing, and my research yields both people agreeing and refuting this. Depends on the person? 
- Relatively worse place to explore my interests in history and the arts? Both academically and in terms of activities to do in campus, or so I've heard

Some other things I'm not too knowledgeable about:
- Safety. I've not done a direct comparison but I haven't heard anything particularly negative about either
- I've only heard stereotypes about either school's social environment. Please weigh in haha

Would love to hear your thoughts on comparing the two, or just about your experience at Brown! Thank youu"

Brown:

Pros
-  open curriculum
- small size means smaller classes so better relationships with other students and professors
- relaxed, not overly-competitive culture (grade inflation is bonus)
- good for CS
- professors focused on teaching rather than research

Cons
- maybe too small? unsure if i‚Äôll find people I like amongst the ‚Äòweird hippie‚Äô culture/lack of ethnic and political diversity
- providence apparently is dead (and cold)
- lowest ivy endowment (means worse dorms, food, etc)


Cornell:

Pros
- best reputation for CS (especially internationally cos i‚Äôm an international student anyways)
- better dorms and food (apparently)
- in new york 
- larger size means more diversity
- lots of resources, clubs, classes

Cons
- biggest con is its stressed, depressive culture (apparently) with grade deflation
- in ithaca (dead?)
- large class sizes means worse relationship with professors and other students, more isolated
- bleak weather


Duke (i know the least about duke):

Pros
- basketball culture, school spirit pretty cool (not that important tho)
- good for CS (not sure about international reputation)
- good weather!! and food, dorms
- like the work hard, play hard vibe

Cons
- not Ivy League (so worse international prestige?) - i believe some companies exclusively hire at ivies?
- marginally worse financial aid package (but maybe could negotiate)
- elitism is a bigger thing?
- located in the South‚Ä¶
- CS is less rigorous?/more focused on coding and software engineering, also heavy pre-professional culture

Some information about me if that helps:
- black intl girl living abroad
- looking to do CS with a year abroad
- wanting to work internationally after graduating
- don‚Äôt want to do post-grad, probably will want to work in some top tech FAANG or equivalent company 
- greek life not important to me
- used to intensive environments, kind of want to avoid that tho
- can‚Äôt drive
- ethnic diversity will never be great but looking for the best of the worst

Feel free to also clear up any misconceptions I have about these schools - most of my opinions have been formed from youtube videos or reddit!"

Wow, I cannot believe that I am in the same situation as my friend from last year. I just got accepted to Brown a few weeks ago for computer science, and a few months ago at UT. However, I did not get into UT Austin's Turing Scholars program.

Brown expects my family to contribute around 80k, we would have to take out some loans to help pay for the COA. UT's cost of attendance (about 30k) is one we can pay without much problem.

Should I take out the loan for Brown? Will the connections/IVY prestige get me a high-paying SWE job at a FAANG company that will help me pay off the loans quickly? Or even the possibility of joining a startup since I assume that many of the people pursuing Computer Science here will be working towards that.

Taking into account the oversaturation of the SWE market, at either school, I am going to make sure I try my best to excel in my classes, while also making sure I build a portfolio outside of class and grind leet code questions(which I have already started doing since senior year started). However, I feel that building a portfolio outside of class would be significantly easier at Brown due to its Open Curriculum and the flexibility it gives its students.

Which route should I take? I know UT's computer science program is very strong, stronger than Brown's in fact (UT is ranked 8 and Brown is like 24 or 25)  but I don't know if it is worth sacrificing a potential Ivy education that will follow me for the rest of my life and will forever be on my resume."

I am planning on being an applied math in economics major and I need help in deciding which of these schools to apply to. For location, I usually prefer bigger cities.

UC Berkeley:  
Pros: Has the most prestige for my major compared to the other schools. Has very extensive research programs. My family wants me to go here because its best for my major and because of its international prestige.  
Cons: Very large school with large classes so it could be harder for me to connect with my professors and get the help I need. Has housing issues and my parents and I want me to stay in the dorms for all 4 years and Berk only guarantees 1 year. Food is also not amazing here.  
Cost: idk yet but i'm out of state so 83k pre-FAFSA.

Brown:  
Pros: Open curriculum so I am able to take more classes that I am interested in. Grade inflation and no GPA so I probably will have a relatively less stressful time here compared to the other schools. Ivy so lots of prestige. I am also guaranteed dorms all 4 years.  
Cons: Dorms and food are rated pretty low. Not rated as high for my major compared to Berk.  
Cost: 33k

Rice:  
Pros: Probably the most happy school and take cares of their students very well. Has good food and in a big city which I like. Also the cheapest for me as they gave me the most financial aid. Small school so able to connect with professors better. Has residential colleges so I will be in a tight knit community that supports each other.  
Cons: Not as prestigious as the other 2 schools.  
Cost: 18k"

London is probably a better option for consulting jobs. I would greatly appreciate it if you could share your insight. I love the idea of going to Brown, but as an engineering major, it seems to be a tad bit lower reputation than the other schools, although the name of the university is more reputable than the others overall. I am very in the middle, what do you guys think I should do? Is the engineering education flawed at Brown? "

I applied for PLME but unfortunately did not get a position, but did get admitted to the undergrad.  


pros: Ivy League, a strong sense of community, connections, ranked in top 10 premeds, my dream school bonnar leadership program--> requires an additional application and will hear back in august  


cons: extremely expensive ‚âà400k, mcat, not uncommon for premed students to add an additional year(70% of brown pre-meds take a gap year) onto premed, with high costs may be discouraged from seeking out opportunities due to costs  


2) UMKC 6 year BA/MD  


\-pros: it's only 6 years long, starts hospital exposure in 3rd week of the first year, no mcat, low gpa requirements Garnteed seat, i know many students who never matched into med even from hopkins.

\-cons: its in Missouri so local opportunities are limited, UMKC focuses on Internal medicine very heavily, and I'm more interested in surgery (as of right now). considered as a ""low tier med school"", very few match into surgery and they don't have rotations in derma, neurosurgery and other top specialties they have sub-par matching, and thus i would spend an additional year conducting research etc to buff my cv, but the question is is this enough?¬†  


3) Mizzou with the STAMPS Scholarship  


pros: full ride, including housing, food, and other expenses, 16k in enrichment funds, which can be used for study abroad, internships, etc, a national network of scholars including at places like Dartmouth UChicago, and USC. Bianiual meet up with all stamps students, research lined up for undergrad.  


cons: mcat, not uncommon for premed students to add an additional year onto premed, especially with increasing competition on a yearly basis.

I'm going to be a part of the class of 2028 and I was wondering if I could receive some advice about where to go for college! I've been beyond blessed to be accepted into WashU, UPenn, and Brown!! I plan on majoring in Public/Global Health on the pre-med track. Here are some pros and cons I've made of the schools so far. Overall I'm leaning more towards WashU right now because of the program, but now I have to think between two other amazing options! Hopefully, you guys can help me narrow down my choices or clear up some misconceptions I may have! Thanks!

**WashU**

**Pros:**

* Full-ride through the Ervin Scholar's Program and amazing fin-aid. I WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY AT ALL.
   * I went on the program's admitted students day and genuinely fell in love. Everyone here seems so sweet and it looks like a genuinely amazing program!
* Top pre-med school (or so I've heard)
* Collaborative and friendly student body
* Prettiest campus out of the 3 imo
* Not too far from home
* Looked into it, and the Brown School of Social Work is one of the best schools for sociology/social work.
   * Ik this is a grad program but I was told that those resources trickle down into undergrad
   * They're putting funding into a school of public health
* Not Greek/party-heavy
* Dorms and other amenities looked super nice

**Cons:**

* St. Louis seems kinda eh. The area around the university seemed nice but also kinda car dependent??
   * I also really wanted to get out of the Midwest for college but it does have that home-y midwest suburban feel that I'm used to
* I've been warned of grade deflation, especially for pre-med classes.
* Less name prestige? I know this doesn't really matter but idk it's just throwing me off

**Brown**

**Pros:**

* Open curriculum!
   * Seems super intuitive because I want to study cross-discipline between healthcare and sociology. I'm afraid I'll get lost though
* Location is the most favorable out of the 3 to me
* Great public health program
* Merch goes hard
* Student body seems so fun and relaxed
* Grade inflation. Would be good for pre-med
* Not Greek/Party heavy
* Was kinda my dream school so it feels weird to let it go

**Cons:**

* Would have to pay about 15K per year
* Not the most reputable for pre-med? Idk if this matters
* Campus was nice but it's a bit small
* Dorms and amenities were kinda dookie

**UPenn**

**Pros:**

* Most prestigious of the 3
* Great for pre-med
   * Good at most things, so if I don't want to be pre-med anymore or if I get weeded out I have great back-up programs
* Campus was pretty nice and Philly seems fun!
* Crazy Alumni network

**Cons:**

* Party/Greek heavy :(
* Heard it's super pre-professional, competitive, and cutthroat
* Would have to pay about 20K per year

  
Edit: Thanks for all the advice y'all. I'm going with WashU! "

I'm looking at double-majoring in CS + Financial Economics/Economics and pursuing a career in Quant Finance/FinTech. I'm unsure which institution would be a better fit for me. I have listed a few pros and cons for myself for both institutions. I'd appreciate any help.



**Columbia**

**Pros**

1. **Prestige**‚ÄîObviously, Columbia has a much better brand. While I know I should not have to factor this into my decision, this plays a huge role for me as an international student. I also want to understand if this prestige would give me an advantage over attending Brown.
2. **Internships**‚ÄîBeing in the middle of NYC, Columbia fosters better connections and opens doors to more internships. However, I'm not sure how much difference this would make for me, since being an international student, I can't work during the academic year.
3. **Academic Rigor**‚ÄîColumbia is known for its academic rigor. I'm someone who thrives under competition and deadlines so I think it would bring out the best in me. I would like to understand how this would play out if I plan to double major and whether or not this leads to unwarranted toxicity.

**Cons**

1. **Cost of Living**‚ÄîNYC is notorious for being an expensive city. Eating and going out will add up. I don't want to burden my parents with expenses on top of the fees they are paying for tuition + board. I would like to get an idea of how hard it is to budget + still have a social life.
2. **Undergraduate focus**‚ÄîColumbia has a significantly higher graduate population. Would this lead to fewer opportunities in terms of interaction with professors, research opportunities, clubs, working on campus, et cetera?

**Pro + Con**

1. **Core Curriculum**‚ÄîI know there are some classes I will love and others I will hate. I think that sums this up.

**Brown**

**Pros**

1. **Concurrent Masters**‚ÄîAt Brown, I can graduate with a Masters degree in 5 years. This would potentially lead to a better career path.
2. **Working during the Academic Year**‚ÄîI know that Brown is known for having multiple jobs that allow undergrad students to work as TAs/RAs.
3. **Undergraduate focus**‚ÄîBrown is a mostly undergraduate institution. This would translate to frequent interactions with professors, the ability to work directly with them, and more resources dedicated to undergrads.

**Cons**

1. **Prestige**‚ÄîWhere I live most people haven't heard of Brown University. While I plan on living in the US, and I know it's known as a top institution there, I'm not sure my family would be convinced.
2. **Academic Rigor**‚ÄîBrown is not known for being the most competitive Ivy. While I might spend more time joining clubs and exploring other interests, it could breed complacency.

**Pro + Con**

1. **Open Curriculum**‚ÄîI'll have the freedom to take courses I like, but I enjoy a more structured environment."

I like that the open curriculum at Brown will give me more flexibility, but Harvard is obviously a huge name. I've been to both campuses, and thought both were pretty nice and going back to both for admitted days.  Had better vibes when I was at Brown, but both felt like they matched my personality. I like being in a city (+ to Boston), but like the less competitive atmosphere at Brown. Want good food and housing, both seem OK on that. Looking to do FAANG/MANGA after graduation. Socially looking for more chill, less partying, and an active club scene including intramural sports.

What do I have right and wrong and any advice on which to choose? I'm honestly torn."

How have you, in your time in PLME, explored specialities and medical interests within first four years? Is there any integration of the medical profession earlier on? From my understanding of the programs handbook, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything like that. Beyond the required PLME courses, if I was to major in a non-STEM concentration, how prepared would I feel for Med School? Do the advisors guide you to take classes through the Open Curriculum to help you prepare? Generally, how does advising look and would you consider it good?

Overall do professors seem more accessible? Do you feel being in PLME has helped you form more relationships with professors? Is the extra research and SRA limited to bench work? Is there public health and clinical orientated research?

However, now I am presented the enormous task of choosing between 4 wonderful colleges.
My major will be economics (could change) and I want to graduate with as little student debt as possible.

I'll explain my situation with each school:

Brown: My top choice IF I could afford it. They want me to pay 67k a year and that's after I appealed for more aid, I'm going to appeal again but I don't have much hope. I absolutely love their open cirriculum and they seem like the chillest ivy. It's extremely expensive, so my question is if the prestige of an ivy league is worth 67k a year? And will the job opportunities I will get from Brown be able to pay off the debt I will accumulate?

Pomona: Nearest to home and I also love this school. The weather is great, but above all they have great professors and opportunities. They're rich as hell for the amount of students that go there. But I'm worried in the world of employment people may not know or even heard of Pomona. I know people say most top Wall Street firms and tech companies know Pomona, but someone I know who works in HR has never even heard of it. It's 48.5k, and for the quality of education it's worth it, but still definitely expensive (especially considering some recent events that have impacted my family's ability to pay tuition)

Berkeley: Their econ program is one of the best in the nation and it's the cheapest out of the four (44k). Unfortunately, I don't love the area or campus but maybe my salary compared to the money I spend in tuition will be worth the struggle.

Cornell: It's an ivy so it'll definitely open some doors for me but I heard Cornell students are quite unhappy and overly competitive. But maybe the salary afterwards will be worth it. Cheaper than Brown at 55k a year. The competitive nature of the school might be worth it considering the amount of doors Cornell could open and the fact it's 10k cheaper than Brown.

How much in student loans do you think is reasonable? Which school do you think I should choose? Thank you to anyone who responds or helps out!"

Am I missing out on opportunities by going? I am interested in entrepreneurship as my main goal and I know both schools have great start up programs. I have seen that Columbia's seems a little better/more established though. Also, while it is not by much, Columbia is a little more well known.

Pros:

\- #1 Data Science program in the country  
\- Know many family/friends so I know how to navigate it  
\- Large school so its easy to make friends  
\- Close to home  
\- Much cheaper  
Cons:  
\- Large school so harder to get individual attention  
\- Much harder/grade deflation  
\- Pretty familiar with the school so may want a change  
\- BIG: pretty undecided in my major ish so its hard to switch majors  
\- Class registration is difficult  


Brown  
Pros:  
\- Prestige, easy to get a job out of most majors  
\- Well ranked in most majors  
\- Small class sizes so individual attention  
\- VERY flexible to switching majors  
\- East Coast (pro/con) so its something new  
\- Very beautiful campus

Cons:  
\- Cost  
\- New environment (don't like the weather)

Brown or UC Berkeley (CS/EECS),https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/1bt2rnh/brown_or_uc_berkeley_cseecs/,13,6,2024-04-01 12:44:41,"I'm super priveledged to have gotten into both Brown and Berkeley(EECS) as an international this year, but am definitely having a little trouble deciding

**Schools:** Brown and Berkeley **Intended major:** EECS at Berkeley, most likely CS + Phil at Brown

**Berkeley** Pros:

* 10k a year cheaper
* Big 4 CS Program
* Higher global ranking
* Better research options
* California Weather
* Silicon valley for internships
* Bay area location

Cons:

* Not the biggest fan of overwhelming highly academic vibe(might be wrong here)
* Safety!
* Overcrowding, issues getting classes etc.
* Less flexibilty in courses outside of major
* Don't want to do electrical engineering

**Brown** Pros:

* Absolutely love the idea of the Open Curriculumn
* I can take CS + Phil if i'd like
* Super interested in branching out beyond CS into other more humanities fields, I feel brown will help with that
* Undergrad TA program(though i think berkeley has something similar?)
* I feel there'd be a lot more balance, more chill atmosphere which i really appreciate

Cons:

* Worse CS Program?
* More trouble landing internships due to location
* Less cutting edge research going on.

**Tiebreaking considerations:**

* I'm leaning towards a 4+1 Masters program which I have as an option at both Cal and Brown, and I believe that the program ranking matters a lot more for Grad school then undergrad so I'm unsure whether this would play a greater role in consideration.
* I've got dysgraphia and ADHD, so accommodations in terms of being able to type out my exams would absolutely be big
* Absolutely love walking, running and cycling, so in terms of the general city, a place with nature, no need for cars that is mostly walkable would be great.
* I'd love it if the school had rock climbing in it.
* Not sure how academic credits from IBDP transfer,
* The UK high potential visa list includes graduates from Berkeley but not from Brown if i want to explore that option

**Addendum:** Definitely a little more of an introvert, prefer a closer knit community, but would love to branch out and find myself doing it the best, when I almost know everyones names but still have some people, who i can just find and strike up conversations with. Would love to live on campus for this reason and a less intimidating sort of feel would probably encourage me to branch out better. Love a more traditional vibe, more suburban, less cars and big buildings, more nature.

I've got one of my close friends who's committing to Berkeley too, though i don't really know anyone committing to brown around me

Thank you so much for any perspectives :))"

If a student is receiving University need-based scholarship and does not have comparable insurance coverage (which also includes no current coverage), Brown will provide additional scholarship funds to cover the cost of the Brown's Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP).

I haven't accepted formally but informally I've been pretty much acting like I have (I even bought merch at the bookstore lol).  I hope this isn't a bad question! This community has been helpful to me before as well! 

However, my anxiety is getting to me because I've read people say that unlike other Ivies/schools in general Brown is more undergraduate-focused. Does this mean graduate students are at some disadvantage? 

I'm thinking especially for the job market (I know TT jobs are generally hard to get). The ability for the open curriculum to translate over to our studies in the form of earning another master's degree (on top of the master's you earn along the way just for completing the Ph.D. timeline) is the most appealing to me which makes Brown unique. If I go to another school, I can only ever get that Ph.D. in that subject and the MA along the way. Having the other MA will help sharpen my interdisciplinary focus and be *part* of the proof to show my employers that I can do that line of work! Brown to me sounds like the utopia of ""interdisciplinary studies."" In fact, I love it so much that it's starting to top my other top choice in the sense of academics.

Again, this is my main concern. I saw too many posts on Reddit and elsewhere saying that Brown is focused on their undergrads (as opposed to graduates?). Also, I believe in the best environment it should be equal, but I understand maybe colleges can't split equally.

Any advice or explanation will help me. I want to ensure I am making the best choice for my future--and I hope it aligns with Brown."

effectively, at top UK unis, class gap is very noticeable and being lower class can strongly impact your uni experience (esp depending on the uni): at brown is there any stigma/prejudice to students on financial aid (especially full like me lol)? would people even know that about each other? does it come up in conversation? is the wealth disparity noticeable or disillusioning? does being on financial aid impact your experience compared to people who aren't?

Hi i‚Äòm looking for an exchange partner that would like to study in Vienna, Austria this Fall+ Winter.

Where?
You will got to the University of Economics in Vienna.(WU Vienna)


About the school:
-It has of the best economics programs in europe.
-Masters programs are ranked top 10 in the world( In case you care about rankings)
-You dont need a car to get around.
-From the university it takes under 90 minutes to be on a ski slope in the alps(with public transportation). 
-Its in Vienna, its a beautiful campus next to nature. 
-You can take courses from every other viennese university including the University of Technology.


About Vienna:
-City with the highest standard of living in the world
-Its safe
-Its a big city with over 2 million people. 
-its in the middle of europe. You can easily drive to neighboring countries or fly all over europe(a ticket to london costs 17$ ). My friends often fly over the weekends.
-The nature is amazing
-Drinking age is 18 


Optionally you can take over my 3 bdrm apartment which is 850sqrft and would cost you around 600$ per month. Or take a flat mate and split the cost.

Dm me if youre interested or have a question

Can you describe your experience in one of those programs? How rigorous were the courses, especially the engineering? 
What were the advantages? Thank you :)

I'm having a tough choice deciding where to go. I've gotten good vibes from all of the programs so far (except for Cornell, which I haven't interviewed with yet). Obviously there's no guarantee I'll actually get offers from all of these places, but right now they're top of my list and I want to hear others' perspectives on where they would go, if they were in my shoes. Would especially love to hear from you if you were also a prospective grad student at some of these other schools but instead decided to go to Brown!

Background on me, if it helps:

\- I've grown up in small (Midwestern) towns and don't mind them. But I also feel like I'm at a stage of my life where it could be helpful to challenge myself and get out there. I take it that Providence is a pretty small city, though

\- I LOVE seafood, hiking/camping, water activities, and skiing. I know it'd be harder to fulfill all of these requirements in Providence or Ithaca compared to Berkeley or Seattle...

\- I plan to go into academia, and would very much like to become tenure track. Unfortunately, I have heard that prestige and legacy really do open doors in academia. Genuinely asking (because I'm truly ignorant about these things), does Brown have good name recognition? I don't know if it's just the fact that I'm from an immigrant family or that I live in the Midwest, but many of my friends and family didn't know about the school or the fact that it is an Ivy when I first mentioned it to them. I assume faculty search committees wouldn't have this problem, but now I'm wondering if this reflects some kind of implicit ranking of Brown among the Ivies?

\- At this point, I have fairly equal labs/PIs of interest at all 4 institutions, so availability of research interests are not a limiting factor in my decision"

For those of us who are uninitiated, the housing lottery, formally known as the ""General Housing Selection,"" is run annually by the Office of Residential Life in March-April of the spring semester to assign beds to each returning student who wishes to live on campus for the succeeding academic year. Seems straightforward, doesn't it? Let's just say... it isn't, and rising sophomores have it the worst. 

Since ResLife isn't the best at giving you the information you need to succeed, I'll dive into how you can best maximize your chances to have a good outcome in the lottery; that is, not end up in the basement of Perkins.

Disclaimer: this guide is specifically for non-TRUE rising sophomores (ie. current freshmen that are not entering their sophmore year after transfer or leave), as that's all I can speak on personally. I am not affiliated with ResLife, so anyone with more insider information is free to add and correct. This is based on my extensive research and personal experience with the lottery.

# How Housing Selection Works

Brown requires that non-TRUE, non-married, or non-commuter students live on campus for three years (your junior year may be exempted, but this is beyond the scope of this guide). Therefore, with highly limited exceptions, you must select housing for the next academic year during this academic year. Your selection will take place during one of a few phases, the dates of which are given generally here:

1. Senior Housing Selection (November-December)
2. Greek, Program, Theme, and Special Interest (GPT & SI) Housing Selection (January-February)
3. SAS Accommodations (February) 
4. General Housing Selection (March-April)
5. Late Assignment (April-September)

**Senior Housing Selection** is beyond the scope of this guide, but for your information: seniors wishing to live on campus select their housing very early, before even disability accommodations are assigned.

**GPT & SI Housing Selection** is the process by which students choose to live in Greek houses (fraternities and sororities), program (communities focused around a common ""interest, identity, or culture,"" such as Tech House, French House, and La Casita), special interest houses (quiet, same-sex, or substance-free housing), and theme houses (Wellness, Sustainability, Interfaith, and Civic Engagement). The common aspect among these options is that they have a *recruitment and application process.*

**SAS Accommodations** is how students with disabilities are assigned beds. Students wishing to gain housing through this process must register with the Student Accessibility Office, which involves medical documentation and a meeting with a dean.

**General Housing Selection** is the process of how ""the rest"" choose their housing. This is *the* housing lottery. After the three previous categories choose their housing, the rest will be randomly assigned ""timeslots"" on specific ""general housing selection days."" There are two such days, falling in mid-April. On the first day, rising juniors select their housing. On the second day, rising sophomores select their housing. You are allowed to select your housing during and after your assigned timeslot, which is a short \~10-minute period falling between 9am and 4pm. There is more complexity, but I'll get into this later.

**Late Assignment** is how students are assigned housing if they did not gain a bed in the General Selection process, whether they tried and failed, or chose to forgo the lottery (this is a strategy, more on that later).

# Why Should I Be Scared of General Selection (and Some Background)?

As background, there are five categories of housing at Brown:

* Suites: contain multiple single rooms (up to six) or a double room and a single room. They often also include a common room. They are often separated from the hallway by another door. They often have a personal bathroom.
* Quads: one ""room"" with four beds. They may be *de facto* two rooms, but you have to walk through one room to get to the other.
* Triples: similar to quads, one ""room"" with three beds. Though there may be *de facto* two rooms, you have to walk through one to get to the other (there are several of these in Minden and Hegeman).
* Doubles: two beds in one room. This is the majority of housing available to sophomores during General Selection.
* Singles: one bed in one room that is directly connected to a hallway.

Notice that I'm talking about specific dorms here: you can learn all about them using the following resources:

* [https://www.hibearnation.net/](https://www.hibearnation.net/): Student Project
* [https://www.brownbeardens.com/](https://www.brownbeardens.com/): Student Project
* [https://reslife.brown.edu/housing-options/residence-halls/UD](https://reslife.brown.edu/housing-options/residence-halls/UD): Dorm Overviews
* [https://www.brown.edu/facilities/res-hall-floorplans](https://www.brown.edu/facilities/res-hall-floorplans): Floorplans
* The dorm tours that ResLife gives in March-April

I know what you're thinking: ""I'm gonna get four friends together, and we're gonna live in a suite in Wellness."" Hold your horses.

While dorms are not necessarily ""reserved"" during General Selection for a specific class year, more desirable dorms fill up quickly. Therefore, General Selection for sophomores has effectively three outcomes: you live in a rare single in Grad Center, you live in a double, triple, or quad with roommates of your choosing, or you fail to select housing and enter the Late Assignment Process. *In other words, during General Selection, it is unlikely that you will select a suite as a sophomore, and singles are highly limited (<200 beds).* The fact of the matter is, there is nothing left beyond those options by the time sophomores select. That means if you would like a suite or a sure single, you need to find a way to select during the GPT & SI or SAS Accommodations Process. And if you can't select during those, you need to have a solid gameplan.

**The Bottom Line: Try not to enter into the General Selection.**

# How to Succeed in Housing Selection: Four Steps

# 1. Apply to Greek, Program, Theme, and Special Interest (GPT & SI) Housing

If you have any inkling of an interest in Greek life or the program houses, *go to their recruitment events.* The recruitment process varies for each program, but they all take place during January and February: 

* Fraternities and sororities run a somewhat traditional rush that they publicize through flyers and posters.
* Many program houses [(complete list here)](https://reslife.brown.edu/program-houses) run recruitment process similar to rush.

If you rush one of these programs and succeed in getting a bid, you'll receive housing through that program through their own process. You're done!

If you aren't interested in a program house, then I *highly recommend* that you apply to theme or special interest housing:

* Wellness, Sustainability, Interfaith, and Civic Engagement are all located in either Sternlicht Commons (built 2022, commonly known as Wellness for the theme house located in it) or the Brook Street Dorms (built 2023). Notice that they were built recently: they are *boujee,* they have suites, and they have singles. You want to live in them. So, apply to them. ResLife will send out an email with instructions on applying; they will require an application with an essay (students have had success with ChatGPT).
* Special Interest Housing is available for students wishing to live on a quiet floor, a same-sex floor, or a substance-free floor. Notice that these are floors, not buildings. However, this housing tends to have suites (quiet housing is in Hegeman this year, one of the few buildings with triple suites). **Please don't abuse this, as there are people who genuinely need this resource.** However, I've put it here to inform you that the option is available if you require this.

If you successfully apply to one of these housing programs, you will still choose your housing during General Selection; however, you'll have those better options available to you.

Many will say that rising sophomores don't get into these programs. That is false--many do. Moreover, it is better to have tried and failed than to simply fail. It is also the one of the only ways to get a suite as a sophomore, and the only sure way to get a single.

**The Bottom Line: Apply to GPT & SI housing. It is one of the only ways to get a suite as a sophomore, and the only way to get a suite of all sophomores.**

# 2. Petition for Accommodations

Another disclaimer: **don't abuse this system, as there are people who need this resource.** Do not attempt to petition SAS without a valid disability or accommodation request. However, if you do require medical accommodations, make sure to register with SAS and enter into the accommodations process. Additionally, accommodations can be gained for religious reasons. More information can [be found here.](https://reslife.brown.edu/housing-selection/returning-students/housing-accommodations-and-requests-process) The added bonus is that you may be able to live in a nicer dorm (eg. Wellness, Brook Street Dorms) or in a definite single. I have a disability but delayed too much on registering; now I wish I would have.

**The Bottom Line: if you require accommodations, don't procrastinate; register with SAS or fill out ResLife's religious accommodations form!**

# 3. Enter the General Housing Selection Lottery

Let's say that you do not succeed at gaining a bed through any of the previous avenues. You have two options now: enter the General Selection Lottery or receive a Late Assignment. For information on the latter, skip to the next step. For guidance on the former, keep reading.

As previously mentioned, the General Housing Selection Lottery (""the Lottery"") takes place over two days. Students are randomly assigned a \~10-minute timeslot between \~9am and \~4pm during one of those days (juniors on the first, sophomores on the second) during which they select their housing. Thus, the only beds available will be those that have not been reserved by any of the previous selection phases or selected by juniors. *Suites are generally not available to groups of only sophomores.*

Here's where it gets complicated: you can form groups with other students of up to six total, and the timeslot for the group's selection is based on the highest time in the group. For example, there is following group with the following timeslots:

Bob: 4/12 3:30pm

Susan: 4/12 2:00pm

Andrew: 4/12 1:00pm

Nikki: 4/12 9:30am

Since Nikki's timeslot is the highest, the group's selection time is 4/12 at 9:30am. Therefore, it's best to form your group with people with high timeslots; you can even form a group with a junior for the best timeslots, and a chance at a suite. 

Note that your group is only allowed to select rooms that ""fit"" the size of the group; that is, our example group will only have quads or four-person suites available, and they cannot pick, for example, four separate singles or two separate doubles. Indeed, if Bob and Andrew opt for a double together, their new timeslot is now 4/12 at 1:00pm. Conversely, a lone student cannot select one room in a four-person suite (this was a problem at one point, apparently).

**The Lead-Up**

Around a month before the Lottery, ResLife sends out the application for General Selection. Make sure to fill it out, or you will be automatically pushed into the Late Assignment process.

A few weeks before, ResLife hosts events to familiarize yourself with the process. *Go to them; the Lottery is an information game.* Attend all of the dorm tours that you can and attend the office hours as much as you need to have your questions resolved. This is when you begin forming your gameplan.

**Group Formation**

During these few weeks before the Lottery, start talking to potential roommates. Get your group of friends together in one place and hash out who's going to be rooming with who. Work through all of these issues in a non-stressful atmosphere so you all are prepared before decisions need to be made. *Make a plan.* Make contingency plans. Make contingency plans for those contingency plans. I have seen friendships torn apart by the Lottery; don't let that happen to you by making your plans early. 

**Your Gameplan**

Remember these resources to search for rooms:

* [https://www.hibearnation.net/](https://www.hibearnation.net/): Student Project
* [https://www.brownbeardens.com/](https://www.brownbeardens.com/): Student Project
* [https://reslife.brown.edu/housing-options/residence-halls/UD](https://reslife.brown.edu/housing-options/residence-halls/UD): Dorm Overviews
* [https://www.brown.edu/facilities/res-hall-floorplans](https://www.brown.edu/facilities/res-hall-floorplans): Floorplans
* The dorm tours that ResLife gives in March-April

Collate information between the floorplans, Hibearnation, and BrownBearDens to determine what category a room is in. You cannot tell what category a room is simply using the floorplan; you have to check it against Hibearnation, BrownBearDens, or the spreadsheet that ResLife provides.

Here's how I would make a plan, in hindsight:

* Your dream plan: imagine you could have any available bed on campus, including those available to juniors (such as suites). Pick which dorm, rooms, and beds you want. This should be a plan that is nearly impossible unless, say, half of juniors suddenly go missing overnight, or you have a junior in your group. Dorms that are nearly impossible as a sophomore in General Selection to get include Young Orchard, Hegeman, Caswell, Barbour, Wayland, small dorms, Brook Street Dorms, and most rooms in Greg.
* Low probability plan: pick a dorm, room, and bed that you will only get if you have a very high timeslot on your selection day, such as before 11am. Grad Center singles are low probability (Grad center singles used to be suites, but they were converted to singles as of 2023).
* Moderate probability plan: pick a roommate(s) that you would be comfortable living in a double or triple in with, and then find rooms in Hope, Littlefield, Slater, Minden, Chapin, Diman, Goddard, Harkness, Marcy, Olney, or Sears. 
* High probability: pick a roommate that you would be comfortable living in Perkins with, then look at its floorplan and choose rooms. Why Perkins? Take a walk there and look around, especially at night when the rats are out. It's not pleasant to live there.

**Timeslot Assignment**

ResLife will send an email with your timeslot about a week before the General Selection days. Again, get your group of friends together and edit your plans. You may need to edit your group as people realize that they may want to use their high timeslot to get a single, instead of a double or triple. Do this early and make contingency plans in case rooms are taken and dorms fill up. Again, friendships have been strained here--minimize the stress.

**The Lottery Days**

ResLife, if they're feeling generous, will provide a spreadsheet of rooms a day or two before. They will periodically update this spreadsheet as beds are selected throughout the General Selection days. Make sure to keep up to date with this spreadsheet and update your plans as needed. Stay in touch with your potential roommates, and be *proactive, not reactive.* Be in a quiet spot with your likely roommate during your selection time. You don't want to have to make a tough decision during your timeslot, and you don't want to have to track people down during that time either.

**The Aftermath**

If you get the room you want, congratulations! You are one of the lucky few who had a positive outcome. If you don't get the room you want, but you still get a room, well, it's only for a year. If you don't get a room at all; you've been relegated to a Late Assignment.

# 4. Late Assignment Housing (and a Wager)

In the Late Assignment process, ResLife assigns you a bed. This bed can be in any dorm and any room (given your roommate is of your preferred sex).

To start, *intentionally entering the Late Assignment process can be a strategy.* Occasionally, singles will open up across campus as students decide to transfer, study abroad, drop out, take leave, or otherwise decide to not live on campus for the next academic year. If you really want a single but end up with a timeslot when no singles are left, you may opt to intentionally enter the Late Assignment process to at least have a chance that ResLife will assign you a single.

There are several downsides to this, however:

* If you don't get a single, ResLife assigns you a roommate(s). You'd be likely living with a stranger.
* You'll likely be assigned to Perkins. So, you'll be living with a stranger in Perkins.
* You may not know where you'll be living until August, as ResLife approves juniors' petitions to live off campus over the summer. So, you'll be living in Perkins with a stranger who you may not meet until the day before move-in.

I haven't known anyone personally who has had success with this strategy, but apparently it can work.

# Conclusion

Good luck! All I can say is, if you want to best room you can get (eg. a definite single or a suite):

* Apply to GPT & SI housing
* If you're eligible for accommodations, register with SAS
* Plan thoroughly for the General Selection, with sufficient back-up plans
* Evaluate the strategy of intentionally entering the Late Assignment process

So I am a prospective high school senior awaiting all of my RD decisions, and I'm trying to get more insight on my top schools! So I LOVE
BROWN... I fell in love with it when I was a little girl and it feels like a fever dream being a senior and actually applying now.  BUT I still have so many questions about the concentration!

1. I understand that there's a practice and a theory based track, and ofc I would be taking the theory track, but would I ever have to do any film related courses? That's not really something I'm into, and it wouldnt be a DEAL BREAKER,  but definitely something for me to think about. Then, piggybacking off of that, for the theory based track, is there actually 4 hours of assigned movies to watch and analyze WEEKLY? I am fully okay with this, but I was wondering if it was a rumor or not.

2. How is your work life balence? Obviously Brown is an top school, and I by no means am expecting an easy ride, but I was wondering how your work life balence is, and how long on average do you spend on school work (homework, essays, studying, assigned readings, etc). I saw somewhere that there's a general sentiment to AVOID MCM classes because they're too much work... is that true? I'm not afraid of hard work, but my biggest goal in college is to maintain a good work/life balence because I have done a terrible job of it while in hs

3. This isn't necessarily a concentration specific question, but it would be helpful if a MCM student did answer it since this experience would likely differ per concentration. How was the transition from hs to Brown as a low income student? My high-school experience has been super easy, and I haven't felt challenged because our programs aren't very well developed and tbh they are more concerned with simply passing students on to the next grade instead of genuinely teaching. I am terrified of going to a super prestigious school in general and feeling like I always have to play ""catch-up"" because I've never had to deal with genuinely being challenged.

4. How would you describe your classes overall/experience overall with your concentration?

5. How would you describe your classes, and what you guys discuss (more so for theory based people).

However, since exploring classes through the open curriculum I have been pointed towards the idea of a religious studies major which really interests me.

I just has a meeting with a dean and she told me that you are not allowed to double concentrate and get a certificate because of a rule trying to point students towards the open curriculum. But she also told me you are able to petition the board. Has anyone gone through this process? I feel like I have a pretty good chance since the reason I want to double concentrate is because I used the open curriculum to find my interest in Religious Studies which I want to further pursue.

ENGN32 is a Terrible Class. Bring back ENGN 30,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/17vxfxa/engn32_is_a_terrible_class_bring_back_engn_30/,37,9,2023-11-15 16:31:17,"Not just a terrible intro engineering class, but just a terrible class period. It's lack of focus on analytical mechanics, a staple for any introductory engineering class, is puzzling. It seems to operate on the philosophy that it can tread a perfect balance between introducing the physics required for engineering and abstract design/innovation thinking. I am walking away this semester feeling as though I've learned nothing of substance from this class.

The storied 'design thinking' Donohue is bestowing on his students is pure fluff. I've concluded there's no reasonable way to teach ""design"" and an effort to systematize it into a class is brainless. What's more frustrating than wasting my time on design projects for this class of no intellectual substance is that the physics instruction is ass. I'm convinced that Donohue lacks any advanced knowledge in engineering physics. The physics PSETs are more challenging than they should be because in-class instruction de-emphasizes the teaching of these concepts. Were it not for the extensive TA resources (which ENGN32 actually does a good job at), there is no conceivable way anyone without an extensive high school physics background could progress through the problem sets. 

No one attends this class. For a class with an enrollment of over 300, I'd estimate we get a 40% turnout for each class. I'm in class rn while writing this post. That should speak to the triviality of whatever 'systems-thinking' fluff he's teaching right now. 

Apologies for the rant. Our large-scale engineering intro should not be ENGN32. Sure, it serves a particular purpose, and if you're interested in design-thinking, you should be able to take it as an elective. It should not, however, be instituted as our *only* large-scale engineering intro. 

The science course instruction at Brown have become increasingly interested in ensuring that future engineers/researchers are more aware of the social impact of their work. However, there are means to inject this ethical compass on our STEM majors without desecrating the entire introductory engineering class. CS15 does this with our SRCs whilst still instructing us in something substantial."

Brown Men's Fencing Club,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/17hynxd/brown_mens_fencing_club/,7,4,2023-10-27 21:57:51,"I am currently on a gap year and I am thinking about going back to fencing in college. I used to fence sabre, but have been thinking about switching to epee. I have not fenced since 9th grade and I was never the best at fencing but it was always just a fun hobby for me. I was wondering how competitive Brown's fencing club is, and whether I have to be very experienced to be able to join the club. If it is possible to join without too much experience I want to put in some time into brushing up on my fencing during my gap year. I'm hoping to see if anyone knows how the fencing club at brown works."
