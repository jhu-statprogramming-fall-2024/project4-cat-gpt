RESOURCES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING MENTALLY/EMOTIONALLY,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/113keop/resources_for_those_struggling_mentallyemotionally/,148,16,2023-02-16 06:56:32,"Below are some resources I personally have used or have been shared with me. No one should have to go through a hard time alone. Note these resources are NOT just for those struggling with suicidal thoughts. If you are in emotional distress or any mental crisis, use these resources! Don‚Äôt wait till it‚Äôs too late to help yourself. Use and share these resources for whoever needs them.

GENERAL RESOURCES  
General Website for Help Lines (trauma, emotional distress, domestic violence, SA/SH, SI, etc) (Call/Text):

CRISIS LINES (confidential)

NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE (call/text): 988 or 1-800-273-8255 [anonymous with licensed counselors]

text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor 

For LGBTQ+ identifying students, the Trevor Project Hotline is START to 678678

BU Crisis Line: 617-353-3575
 Call the number and stay on the line (it will prompt you) to be connected to a licensed crisis counselor. I personally have used this multiple times and have found it helpful for short term distress management. 

(i understand some ppl have issues w text lines- it can be a little frustrating at times but it can be cathartic to vent to a stranger!) 

‚Äî‚Äî

FOCUS/SUPPORT GROUPS

BU Behavioral Medicine has specific weekly [focus groups](https://www.bu.edu/shs/behavioral-medicine/services-we-provide/behavioral-medicine-groups/)dealing with trauma, depression, anxiety, Black support groups, Asian support groups, different cultural groups and even just mindfulness groups (yoga, meditation, organization and study skills, etc) 

the [Justice Resource Initiative](https://jri.org/services/behavioral-health-and-trauma)(JRI) provides tons of amazing culturally-sensitive and individualized mental health services all over Massachusetts (Trauma-Informed Individuals, Group and Family therapy, School-based services, Yoga and Expressive Art therapies, etc etc). Located in Boston/Brookline and relatively inexpensive 

‚Äî‚Äî

the world is a tough place but you are never alone! i‚Äôve been there and so have many other people. pls reach out if ur struggling. if someone doesn‚Äôt provide u the care u need, DONT GIVE UP! there will always be somebody (crisis counselors, friends, family, n random ppl like myself) willing to listen.

EDIT: note these are resources for distress management and are meant to supplement, NOT REPLACE, traditional forms of treatment"

Had some fun playing frisbee, write some articles for school paper. Outside of that, the school was kind of mid- didn't bring in speakers, a lot of clubs were dead and there was no town around campus. My choices are BU and oppo BU- Hamilton. I know Hamilton is rural but I am from Mass and can have a car there plus they seem a lot more ""concierge"" than BU. Like right now even I commit and pay BU, I cant' register for classes until Jan 17th. And all of a sudden the amount of hoops I have to jump through are extending for BU. Hamilton I get 3 advisors (one is a career advisor) the students seem more academic and less artsy than the college I am currently at. But the draw to an urban campus is compelling and Boston is amazing. Plan to study IR and minor in econ. If I go to Hamilton it is open curriculum and I can major in IR and double minor.

Anyone here ever had any issues with ExamSoft?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/1gsrqj2/anyone_here_ever_had_any_issues_with_examsoft/,4,4,2024-11-16 17:05:04,"Hi all,

I took an exam on ExamSoft earlier this week in a class I had a 92 average in. The few questions I felt iffy on, I googled afterwards and was happy to see I had mostly gotten them right, only to get my exam back and see that I got a 62%. I was genuinely shocked as usually I know when I don't understand the material for assessments and unless I had somehow misunderstood nearly half of the questions I felt confident in, I don't know how I could have done so poorly, especially on material I understood well based on previous quizzes. I did fifteen points below the class average.

While I'm maybe being paranoid here, is it possible that ExamSoft could have made some errors? The first time I tried uploading the exam after finishing, it said that the upload had failed and I had to try again. I also faced an issue where I was delayed to downloading the exam file and I had to get help from IT as the exam was starting to figure out what was going on. I totally could have just been a dumbass and tanked this the old fashioned way, but I wanted to see if anyone else at BU had run into issues with this.

Thanks!"

Its even more gross that they're asking students to fund the food pantry, student orgs and UROP. If you donate to this, you're telling BU its ok for them to offload fixing student food insecurity and other student's paychecks for research onto *other students*, when these are programs that should be 100% supported by BU's multi-billion dollar endowment. You (future you paying your loans back or your parents) pay BU up to $90K a year and, instead of that money going towards these programs, they stuff the pockets of incompetent vice assistant deans you've never heard of running worthless pet projects that do nothing to improve the BU student experience.

Don't give them permission to not fund these critical resources themselves- DO NOT donate to this fund. It's shameful that they even asked.

Am I delusional for second guessing a guaranteed acceptance + full ride to BU?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/1gp42wr/am_i_delusional_for_second_guessing_a_guaranteed/,12,23,2024-11-11 21:42:18,"For some context: I'm a senior in HS right now, live in a low income household, and my parents are extremely religious and emotionally abusive. Because of my family's financial status, I've been doing everything I can in school to guarantee I leave for free. I found a scholarship that gives a guaranteed acceptance and full tuition (because of my income, I'm 90% sure the rest would be free anyway) to Boston University for a small group of students. I was selected to be a finalist for BU and at this point in the scholarship process, its a binding decision. If I'm selected to go to BU (half of us will be chosen) it's basically ED. It sounded like an awesome deal and during my second interview I thought the scholarship directors liked me a lot. I like BU enough (it isn't among my favorites but its a great school and I'm pretty desperate to leave).

Anyways,¬†**my doubts related to the scholarship as of right now are primarily about regretting not giving schools I like more a chance if chosen to go to BU OR regretting not going to BU when given the opportunity to if I get rejected by literally every school in the spring.**¬†I'm asking this now because there are a couple of students on the waitlist for the scholarship and at this stage I can give up my spot. I've been trying my hardest to detach myself the obsession with T20 schools + trying not to compare my situation to others knowing that taking the risk to not accept the scholarship is bigger for me (family situation) than others I know.

I‚Äôm a senior here at BU and I‚Äôm living in an apartment double in south with my roommate from last year. I picked an apartment double in south because it was relatively one of the cheaper options. Recently, my roomate and I have been having disagreements on the hygiene of our shared areas. He came home drunk the other night and decided to pick a fight with me about these issues. While I was ready to work things out, they kept on bringing the conversation into how I am super douchey person and that I‚Äôm rude and unapproachable.

 It has caught me all so off guard.

Should I regret turning down BU?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/1gohnzl/should_i_regret_turning_down_bu/,0,6,2024-11-11 02:24:34,"I‚Äôm a freshman at Santa Clara University (a small Jesuit Catholic school in the SF Bay Area), and I can‚Äôt help but feel like I made a mistake by choosing SCU over Boston University. I've lived in Santa Clara my whole life and attended my entire education from Pre-K to 12th grade in this same city. I'm hoping to get some perspective on my situation, so I‚Äôm here to ask for advice from anyone who might have been in a similar boat.

Here's a bit of background:

I got into SCU's Leavey School of Business (SCU admits all of their business students undeclared) and BU‚Äôs College of Arts & Sciences for Econ. I live at home and commute to SCU because it's free for me (even getting paid a few grand to go there from scholarships), whereas BU would have cost about $5,000 annually for room and board after need-based aid and I would have had to take out loans for that cost over four years. BU actually offered me more financial aid than SCU did, but because I‚Äôm commuting to SCU, it would be the cheaper option. I extended BU‚Äôs deadline to accept the admission offer, but ultimately my parents were adamant about me graduating debt-free. They‚Äôre so adamant about me graduating debt-free that they even wanted me to turn down UC Davis to go to UC Santa Cruz over a $1,000 price difference annually from a tentative financial aid offer. They didn't even let me visit BU‚Äôs campus during orientation, calling it a waste of money, and they really pushed for SCU because it‚Äôs cheaper and they think it's already a decent school. They‚Äôre not comfortable with me taking on any debt unless it‚Äôs a top-tier school, with the minimum being Duke, Cornell, or Northwestern, or if I did not get into SCU with a good scholarship. I got into NYU and UCLA, but declined both due to cost (BU and SCU were much more affordable).

At the time, staying at home and going to a school that‚Äôs essentially free seemed like a no-brainer‚Äîno huge financial burden, no travel logistics. But now, about a couple months into my first year, I regret it. I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I missed out on the ‚Äúfull college experience,‚Äù especially being out-of-state. I feel stuck. I wonder if I made the wrong choice, and I sometimes daydream about what it would‚Äôve been like to live in Boston, meet people from all over, and have more of a traditional college lifestyle. I also feel like the SCU campus is much smaller than I expected, and it feels more like an extension of high school, especially because I‚Äôm commuting. To be honest, I‚Äôm starting to get bored of the Santa Clara and San Jose area. The endless sprawl of Silicon Valley is starting to feel monotonous, and even though San Francisco is close by, I‚Äôve been there so many times I‚Äôve lost count. It just doesn‚Äôt excite me the way it used to.

I think I should‚Äôve just taken on the loan and gone to BU. It wouldn‚Äôt have been that much debt in the grand scheme of things, and I feel like I might‚Äôve been happier there. But now I‚Äôm at SCU, and I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

I also can‚Äôt help but think that BU, with its bigger name, could have given me more opportunities down the road. I know SCU has its strengths, but the image of a university on the East Coast like BU keeps pulling me. The chance to live in Boston in my carefree early 20s feels like something I might not get another chance at. The BU-BC Hockey Rivalry, living in a dorm with roommates, the snow, eating at historic restaurants with friends, taking the T‚Ä¶ it all sounds so exciting to me.

On top of that, it‚Äôs not just me‚Äîpeople at SCU really seem to look up to BU when I tell them that I got accepted there. In fact, one of my friends here is actively trying to transfer to BU or similar schools on the East Coast. It makes me feel like SCU just doesn‚Äôt have that same prestige or reputation among my peers, and I can‚Äôt help but wonder if that affects my future opportunities. However, my parents say that SCU will be better for my career as I plan on working in Silicon Valley post-graduation. 

One thing I also have a problem with is the quarter system at SCU. I know many people like it, but for me, it feels rushed. Each quarter flies by, and I find it hard to build momentum or dive deeper into subjects in the same way you can in a semester system. It‚Äôs not that SCU‚Äôs academics are an issue‚Äîthey are rigorous enough, all my peers are fairly ambitious and I‚Äôm definitely learning new things. Clubs like the Santa Clara Investment Fund and certain business fraternities are highly competitive, and I know that certain investment banks and private equity firms actively recruit from these groups. So, in terms of academic and career preparation, I feel I‚Äôm getting the right exposure, and there will be definitely some challenges in terms of workload as I take upper-division courses. But sometimes I wish I had the time and space to really dive deep into what I'm learning, which the semester system at BU might have allowed for.

At the same time, SCU really is a comfortable place to be. The campus facilities are nice‚Äîmost buildings feel new and modern, and the small class sizes really allow for a lot of personalized attention from professors. The gym and swimming pool are never too crowded. At SCU, the courses are not too easy nor too challenging. The people here (students and staff alike) are incredibly friendly and welcoming, which makes it easy to feel at home. The weather is almost always warm and pleasant, which gives it a kind of easygoing vibe that makes life here feel‚Ä¶ well, comfortable. The whole experience just feels very smooth and predictable, but sometimes I wonder if that comfort has led me to be a little complacent. I think I need more challenge, more excitement, more newness in my life.

And honestly, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôm romanticizing BU too much. Maybe if I had gone there, I‚Äôd be feeling just as frustrated as I do now. Would I have hated it just as much as I‚Äôm now regretting not going? I guess I‚Äôll never know, but it‚Äôs hard not to feel stuck when I imagine what could‚Äôve been.

That said, my parents argue that by staying at SCU, I have the opportunity to save money, and it sets me up for a better future. They say that since SCU is free, I can use the savings to explore the world, and when the time comes, I can apply to top graduate programs anywhere I want‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs on the East Coast, abroad, or in a different field entirely. The idea of having that flexibility is something I‚Äôm trying to keep in mind, especially since I don‚Äôt want to let my current frustration cloud my long-term potential.

Living at home also means I don‚Äôt have to worry about the logistics of living in a new city on the opposite side of the country‚Äîlike finding housing, packing bags, booking hotels/flights, managing a social life, or dealing with the typical freshman year challenges. That‚Äôs allowed me to focus more on my grades, and as a result, I‚Äôm able to maintain a high GPA without added stress. It seems like this could prepare me better for graduate school admissions since I‚Äôll have more time and energy to focus on my studies. In a way, the lack of distractions here might be giving me an advantage when it comes to the academic grind, especially when it comes to competing for spots in top-tier graduate programs or finding internships.

The long-term payoff at SCU might actually be stronger than BU in the end even if I just plan on getting an undergraduate degree. I‚Äôm planning on going into technical marketing or tech consulting, so I know that strong academics and the right network are key. SCU‚Äôs business program has a great reputation for tech-related business, especially in the Bay Area where tech companies are based, and that might give me a leg up when I graduate. But BU‚Äôs name might open more doors on the East Coast and nationally. I wonder if it would have better or worse connections for the kind of career I‚Äôm aiming for compared to SCU.

Generally, SCU‚Äôs business school produces higher salaries and better job placement outcomes compared to BU‚Äôs College of Arts & Sciences for economics or even their Questrom School of Business. Shockingly, SCU even outearns USC Marshall according to CollegeScorecard. Even though the Bay Area is expensive, the earning potential for SCU's business school is significant enough that it could easily offset the cost of living here compared to BU. So, while I‚Äôm frustrated now, I might just be overlooking the financial advantages in the long run.

So, what should I do now? Do I stick it out here at SCU, finish my degree, and make the best of it, or is it too late to transfer to BU? Would BU even accept me now that I‚Äôm already a quarter into SCU?

Has anyone else been in a similar situation, where they regretted choosing one school over another for financial reasons? How did you handle it?

TL;DR: Chose SCU over BU for financial reasons (SCU was free for me, BU would‚Äôve cost $5,000/year). Now I regret it, miss the idea of living out-of-state, and feel like I‚Äôm stuck. What should I do now? Also, I‚Äôve heard that BU has a reputation for grade deflation, which could make it harder to maintain good grades there. Do grad schools or employers account for this?"

2019 alum here. I think a lot of us got the email earlier this year to migrate our stuff from the BU Drive since they were gonna shut it down/cut off alumni from the service. 

I used Google Takeout which I was advised to do since I had about 2TB of files on there (family videos, photos from client sessions, etc) however it was only just the past week that I realized most, if not all of the files that were downloaded and zipped were corrupted (and not to mention, the files were all over the place)

It looks like I now need to access the Drive again to hopefully get these downloaded correctly this time (first time, even with corruption, took almost 6 straight days).

Financial Aid (Has this happened to anyone else?),https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/1gm0nkx/financial_aid_has_this_happened_to_anyone_else/,13,6,2024-11-07 20:46:05,"Sorry this is long. I'll try to explain it as well as I can but I'm so confused as well so sorry. I also think I understand the situation but just want to see if anyone else is going through this because I don't really get why this happened.

I took an online summer I course and applied for the HUB-need based scholarship. I got it and it was put on my account with no issues.

For my fall semester and before this weird incident, I had gotten my financial aid package and accepted it all, paid off most of my fall tuition, and only needed about 700 dollars. However, I look on my account and I suddenly get a scholarship for the summer II semester that pays off the rest of my fall semester. I never took a summer II course so I get scared about it and go to first point as well as called the financial aid office about the sudden charge and they tell me that it must have been an additional scholarship that they just put under summer II as a way to add that scholarship to my fall tuition bill. I didn't really understand what they meant but it was something like that and they told me to not worry about it at all and that my fall tuition bill was completely covered. So I didn't worry about it as much and used some of my money to help myself out more as well as my family.

Then today I get an email that there has been a changed to my financial aid. Now they added charges to my summer I bill and I have to pay about 700 dollars again.

I'm assuming they just gave me a random scholarship that they didn't mean to give but when i called the financial aid office, they said that there was a note that it was because they gave me a pell grant for the summer II semester but since they can only give out the max pell grant, they charged me (I don't understand this much tbh especially since I didn't take a summer II course). Then the student accounting offices told something else but at this point I was crying and so stressed that I just couldn't process what she said (my fault tbh and she had repeated it like two times so I felt bad). I think it was something like my assumption but also I might have interpreted it wrong.

I think I will be fine money wise but this whole thing has sent me feeling so many emotions and I am just so tired now. I'm just here to ask if this has happened to anyone else recently?"

roommate wants to have sex with his grandma,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/1gjts3k/roommate_wants_to_have_sex_with_his_grandma/,80,10,2024-11-05 00:22:05,"hello all, i (M20) am a junior at BU who got pulled into a stuvi2 double by an upperclassman friend. though i was super grateful for the opportunity, i‚Äôve been having some issues with my roommate.

at first my roommate was normal. he was very nice, kept his side clean, and even has a nice singing voice. we got along pretty well. then one night, while we were casually talking, all of a sudden he asked me what my type in women was. i thought this was a little weird, but i didn‚Äôt think too much of it. i responded honestly and told him that i‚Äôm really into ABGs, which was a very normal answer. then after, he asked me if i prefer them older. initially i thought he meant maybe a few years older, to which i answered i guess, but that wasn‚Äôt something i actively looked for. turns out he was talking women in their 80‚Äôs. 

i laughed it off as a joke because like, what? but he was being deadass. for his sake i tried to put some thought into it, but the idea of a wrinkly old ABG was a serious turnoff, which is saying a lot since i‚Äôm super into any and all kinds of asian women. so that‚Äôs what i told him, but then he responded confessing that he‚Äôs been fantasizing about older senile women. as much as i got along with my roommate, we weren‚Äôt THAT close for him to be confessing his sexual fantasies to me like that. so at this point i was already uncomfortable. 

but that was when he dropped the bombshell on me. he wasn‚Äôt just fantasizing about any old woman. he was fantasizing about his fucking grandma.

i was flabbergasted. what the fuck??? i didn‚Äôt know what to say. he just continued to confess more about his dark desires to me and i could only sit and listen in shock. over the summer he flew to his home country for the sole purpose of seeing her. and NOT in a wholesome way. if you get what i mean.

anyways, after that conversation i think it‚Äôs safe to say that i‚Äôm pretty uncomfortable being around him. 

so that being said, does anyone want a free double in stuvi2? üò≠"

On Sunday November 3rd, undergraduate seniors will register for classes.

* **A HOLD on your account will prevent you from registering.** Holds cannot be resolved over the weekend, so you will not be able to register until next week UNLESS you get rid of your holds TODAY! I do not want to see ANY of you complaining on reddit because you didn't realize you have a hold and can't register. This is your warning!
* **Sleeping through registration could screw you over**. SET. AN. ALARM for your registration day. Set 2 alarms! Again, I do not want to see ANY of you complaining about sleeping through your time slot.
* **You will be unable to register if your classes have any time conflicts**, even if it is an exam period conflict! Reach out to your advisor to confirm!

For the past 2 months I've been using this AI tool called Insta Doodle ([Link here](https://instadoodle.com/cb-special?&shield=3d53dzr5q37zgq65qjx4p902ue)) to make a decent amount of money on the side. It's a platform that allows you to generate whiteboard explanation videos. They're the type of videos you see on a lot of sales pages that explain the concept of whatever's being sold.

I've been creating and selling the videos to new ecommerce stores, Skool communities and on marketplaces like Fiverr, Freelancer, Upwork and believe it or not Etsy lol (I've also seen a few people selling them on eBay so I might try that in future). I sell basic videos for $20-$40 depending on length and upsell the voiceover which I use ElevenLabs to generate for an extra $20. Considering Insta Doodle is only $37 for lifetime access it's pretty easy to turn a profit, all you need is one sale basically and you've broken even.

On the marketplaces mentioned I just made listings and they're slowly getting more sales as they get reviews. I think success on Fiverr, Upwork and Etsy is more of a time thing, you write a decent pitch and then just wait for results. I also respond to any requests I see on Fiverr, Upwork and Freelancer where they're looking for whiteboard animation, product explanation videos or a product spokesperson (a whiteboard video is kind of a spokesperson lol).

As for selling to ecommerce stores and Skool communities I first tried cold emailing using mailing lists that I bought but I didn't have much success. I found the most success just dming accounts on Instagram and TikTok with a sales pitch, pricing and a couple example videos (The newer the business the easier they are to sell I've found). The conversion rate on these messages is actually pretty crazy, I haven't calculated the number but this is where I've made the most money.

Delete this post if it's not allowed but I thought it'd be helpful for anyone needing some extra money, we've all got bills haha."

Hey BU!

With registration around the corner, I‚Äôve updated¬†Terrier Schedule ([www.terrier-schedule.dev)](http://www.terrier-schedule.dev) to include Rate My Professor integration ‚Äîso you can see¬†professor ratings, difficulty scores, and even click through to full reviews directly in the schedule.

If you haven‚Äôt heard of Terrier Schedule, here‚Äôs some of its features:

* Schedule Conflict Detection: Instantly see any time conflicts between classes.
* Visual Schedule Layout: Get a clear, color-coded visual of your week.
* Major & Course Code Filtering: Filter classes by major, or search for any course by its code (yep, it can handle abbreviations like ""CASCS 112"", or ""CS 112"").
* Registration Availability Toggle: Want to see only the courses you can actually register for? Toggle this option and no more wasted time on unavailable classes!

Side Note: The¬†class availability feature¬†will be updated¬†at the end of each day, not live as students are registering.

The program here in Masters is very selective and competitive which makes it hard to get grades since we have curve system. Also, when I first moved here I had really unfortunate events regarding housing and racism at work which affected my grades and motivation a lot. 

I also have Research and Teaching experience, each for one year.

Is there something in the portal that outlines what docs are needed, or will he get an email from the FA office telling him what to send? Or does the CSS website provide updates? I wasn't sure how long it takes the school to determine what additional documentation they need, but we want to be sure they have everything (except the FAFSA of course) by November 1. His HS just switched from Naviance to Scoir so even his counselor is a little uncertain as to how everything syncs. "

Graduate accepted. Now what?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/1g7mvfs/graduate_accepted_now_what/,8,2,2024-10-20 00:35:25,"Hi, this will be long :)

I recently discovered I got accepted to MS master starting spring, against all odds.  
Now I have to decide if I really want to come here or not (I'm a US citizen living in Italy since forever).  
What's the next move? I'd like to get a federal loan (plus or unsubsidized) because there's no scholarship or fellowship (I got no merit) covering the whole BIG quota...and then I have to look for housing and ""meal subscriptions"", things that are quite uncommon here where I live..

Does anyone know a few tips about prices and housing to help me out? I'm checking everywhere to get information but I still have a very loooooong road ahead of me to understand most of all.

Another question for graduates or internationals who live there:  
How's the campus life? Are there some kind of clubs/communities to make friends and help with studying?

To be honest the price looked on the ""net calculator"" is pretty high, so anything that may help reduce the cost will be appreciated.

Thank you"

To all current high school seniors: an overlooked reason to avoid BU,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/1g7vlj0/to_all_current_high_school_seniors_an_overlooked/,0,5,2024-10-20 10:20:40,"I think a lot of people on this subreddit, either through rants or more objective discussion, may have already turned you against applying to BU, and understandably so (reddit is a totally unfilitred way of tapping into the culture of a school). A lot of these issues are still, however, going to be present in other schools; here's one that isn't.

Any student at BU will probably relate to the following experience: you're trying to do research for a class, you find a paper online you want to read/cite, but you can't because you don't have access to the journal. When this first happened to me, I was surprised to note that other, supposedly ""less prestigious schools"" such as uMass and Boston College gave access to many of these gatekept articles. Turns out, talking to a longtime professor here, BU has a history of not subscribing to key journals unlike the majority of other universities. I think this is disgraceful - how can a university claim to foster the growth of knowledge if it doesn't invest in giving it's students access to prior research? What's the point of dumping a bunch of money at an academic institution that invests that money in overpaying their dean instead of subscribing to key journals?

  
Just wanted to illustrate an overlooked, very tangible way that BU does something that its students quickly comes to know during their time here: BU pays attention to what looks flashy to applicants, not what creates quality of life for students. If other students have different examples to illustrate this larger point, please comment them - it would be a great resource for current HS seniors!"

Just a disclaimer on top: the base rent for the room is around $1600(It's totally NEGOTIABLE within a small range). Ik it's a bit expensive but for Boston and the quality of our building, it is guaranteed a steal!

Our unit is a spacious 3 bed/2 bath apartment on the 11th floor, offering a great view of the city. the building is a luxury apartment complex with really cool amenities, including a rooftop terrace/lounge, a fully-equipped gym(approved by 2 gym rats living in this apt), an outdoor terrace with BBQ areas, and a swimming pool.

The commuter rail station is just a 1-minute walk away. We‚Äôre also conveniently close to the 66, 64, and 57 bus stops. The New Balance factory store and the newly opened Stop & Shop are right across the street. We‚Äôre also about a 15-minute walk from the heart of Allston, where you can find restaurants, liquor stores, bars, cafes in the area

About the roomies::  
Our entire unit is 1,412 sq ft. The master bedroom is taken up by a couple(i'm BU alum and my bf went to northeastern) - we‚Äôre respectful, we're busy with work and love to gym, we use our own bathroom and TV, keep to ourselves most of the time. The other bedroom is taken up by a female graduate student at BU, who is clean, considerate and very friendly. We're all good friends and hang out a lot, we would love it if you like to hang but also don't mind if you just wanna split rent. We also expect you to be clean, well-organized, and respectful of our house rules and others‚Äô living spaces. If you‚Äôre interested, feel free to DM me to get to know us and the apartment more!"

Advantages of getting 100 in a class versus getting a 93?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/1g33ljx/advantages_of_getting_100_in_a_class_versus/,10,13,2024-10-14 00:12:17,"I transferred from an overseas uni that does not use a GPA scale but instead uses a measurement called weighted average mark, which is within a continuous interval from 0 - 100.  


Here at BU (and US unis in general) , it seems like getting 93 and 100 in a class makes no difference to your GPA.

Since both equate to a 4.0 on the GPA scale (for most classes), are there any perks/extra opportunities for getting a 100 instead of 93?

I would guess that perhaps getting an 100 would make you a good candidate for TA/TF positions, but it seems that my department (CAS Math) only hire grad students for this."

Bit of context: I am trying to do all 3 of these next sem, along with MA230. I primarily want to take 585 next sem because the professor teaching it might be on sabbatical a year later, and I enjoyed this professor's lecture in another class this semester. Since 585 lists 581 as a prerequisite, I figured they might have some overlap in content so it might ease my workload a tiny bit.

1. to what extent do these classes use MA225? (I was gonna take 225 this sem but ended up not because I wanted to take 230 in the spring. But I have been attending most of the 225 lectures and have studied calc III before (but credit didn't transfer).)
2. Is 585 doable if I self-study parts of 581 over the winter and the remainder of the fall semester? (the professor for 585 next sem is one of my professors rn, they said it would be frustrating but doable if I try hard enough)
3. Is there much overlap of content between any of the 3?"

MET CIS MS and CS 669 Database Implementation Experiences?,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/1fzpn2q/met_cis_ms_and_cs_669_database_implementation/,7,6,2024-10-09 11:57:14,"I'm a part time MET MS in Computer Information Systems online student. This is my first semester at BU, first semester of postgrad coursework and I'm also working full time. I'm looking for any advice from people who have done this course and/or those who have completed or nearly completed the degree. 

I started with MET 625 (Business Networking) and the class is a LOT of information in a short period of time. I found myself spending about 25+ hours per week on this one class and nearing the end of it. Retaining new information has been tough as there is so much every week and it's hard to know what level of detail is needed until you're quizzed on it, and sometimes you're quizzed on surprisingly specific aspects of the reading. 

My next class is MET CS 669 online with Mansur and from what I've read this class is an even greater time commitment by design, with some people on RateMyProfessor giving this class / him scathing reviews. It's a required class and he seems to be the only person who teaches it online. 

1. Is CS 669 that difficult? How was your experience and do you have any advice on how to manage the workload and be successful? Are the RMP reviews fair?

2. Are all of the classes in the program this way? Either I picked two time consuming classes to start with, or it's going to be a long 18 months! 

I'm committed and ready to work, but trying to calibrate my effort vs. the reward as I balance my job, parenthood, and school. I already don't have a social life, so that's sort of a non-issue at least. Thanks for any insight or recommendations on how to be successful."

However, I also have quite a few major requirement classes next semester (I'm a business major and econ minor) so I could only choose one. Therefore, any experiences with these two professors or classes will be appreciated, like whom to choose or whom to avoid. For more contexts, I will be applying for economics masters programs soon so grading is also important."
