"Orion Housing stole my deposit, so I took them to court and won (How you can too)",https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/1gvkenn/orion_housing_stole_my_deposit_so_i_took_them_to/,317,16,2024-11-20 07:46:56,"Hey trojans! If you rented with Orion Housing or any corrupt leasing company and had your security deposit illegally withheld, here's a step-by-step guide on how you can fight back and win. KNOW YOUR RIGHTS ‚Äì California Civil Code Section 1950.5 is your best friend here.

* Understand What They Can and Cannot Charge You For: Your landlord cannot make you pay for repainting or refreshing the unit if it's just normal wear and tear. They also can't add bogus charges like a $35 ""administrative fee"" for sending your deposit back. These are not allowed under California law.

* Demand Proof: Start by sending a formal demand letter asking for re-evaluation of your deposit. Request itemized receipts for all charges over $125. They must prove these costs are for damages beyond normal wear and tear. In my case, they gave me a vague, totally bogus receipt that wasn't even itemized and didn‚Äôt match the deductions they made.

* Gather Evidence: Take pictures, keep documents, and make sure you have proof that the unit was clean and undamaged when you left. This documentation is key if they try to make arbitrary deductions.

* Take Legal Action: If they still refuse to return your deposit, take it to small claims court. I filed my case at the Beverly Hills Courthouse (highly recommended), using an SC-100 form. You‚Äôll also need to pay a small fee to have an officer serve them the court papers. Make sure your claim is clear‚Äîshow how their deductions are arbitrary and illegal under California law. In my case, the court found Orion Housing acted in bad faith, so I got my full deposit back PLUS ***thousands*** in additional damages.

* Stay Strong and Hold Them Accountable: Even if you don't win extra damages, it's about holding these companies accountable to what the law says they owe you. At the very least, you‚Äôll increase your chances of getting your deposit back.

I'm actually a UCLA grad, but I saw they manage a lot of housing at USC and no rivalry should allow corrupt companies to take our money! Good luck and lmk if you have any questions."

I‚Äôve been in contact with the biology professors who monitor the campus squirrels, who have confirmed this is illegal and definitely not part of any university course. It is animal abuse, and moreover a hazard for the students (squirrels are easily frightened and have sharp claws).

As a result, the earliest day my advisor has is three whole days after my registration day...

As application prep, questions, and interest in the USC Transfer Discord have started to pick up as we approach the new year, we are reposting the link (as was planned) to the server for anyone interested.

[**https://discord.gg/59w6kFzXKh**](https://discord.gg/59w6kFzXKh)

Reminder to do some external research via USC policy pages and prior discussions on various forums. Take all information sources including Discord servers with a grain of salt unless it comes directly from USC staff.

Also, we are aware in past years (especially the last cycle) the chats got very wild and were unhelpful to a lot of people. We are doing our best this cycle to mitigate that and separate the channels without completely policing what people discuss. Until late spring (well past the actual application submissions), there will be fewer members on the server, and therefore so far discussion has been entirely USC-related and we are hoping that continues at least until the application deadline.

Thanks everyone, and best of luck. Fight On!"

I'm aware of the fact that they give merit scholarships but I dont think I'll be able to win that considering the competitiveness let alone even if they are gonna accept me. I have been working hard towards a better uni application for USC but I dont think it will be worthy at all.

I have been offered admission for Spring 25 as a PhD student. Now, I have to decide between either a USC family housing ""now"" or apply for it ""later"" during the Fall 25 application cycle.

Basically, I won't be needing a family housing until Fall '25 (August 25) as I am not bringing my family from Spring 25.. I plan to move into USC housing alone from Spring 25 and bring my family later from Fall 25. So, my questions are:

1. If I start living in a non-family housing (say Troy East / Sierra etc.) from Spring 25, will it be possible to change my housing to Family housing (say Regent, Sunset, Regal Trojan) from Fall '25?

2. Is there a possibility of not being able to change my housing later for Fall '25 because new intakes will be prioritized and students who are already assigned to USC housing will be last in priority?

So, should I opt for family housing from Spring 25, or later when I will bring my family in the Fall?

PS: Can certain individual needs, like having a newborn or some other necessity, be eligible for special consideration?

But I‚Äôm curious: is the difference really that significant in terms of how employers view having ‚ÄúMarshall‚Äù on your resume? Do people in the industry view these programs as very distinct in terms of career flexibility and opportunities?

A bit about me: I‚Äôm 30, graduating from UCSB with a Philosophy degree (focused on ethics and public policy), and I also completed UCSB‚Äôs Technology Management Certification. I‚Äôm currently Head of Product Support at a health tech startup‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve been doing since my senior year. I‚Äôm looking to potentially pivot into supply chain, specifically in the food industry. Before this, I was a general manager for four years at a popular spot in LA (if you‚Äôre into sushi, im sure you can guess where ). So, while I have management experience, I don‚Äôt have formal supply chain experience.

The MS GSCM appeals to me since it‚Äôs faster and cheaper than the MBA, and at my age, I‚Äôm looking to get back into the workforce sooner rather than later. But I want to make sure I‚Äôm not limiting myself too much in terms of career growth or perception by employers. I also want to make sure if supply chain isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life that I am not stuck with such a specialized degree.

Any insights or advice from those who know the programs would be super helpful. Thanks in advance!"

"Oh well, simulation !",https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/1ggqc3t/oh_well_simulation/,17,1,2024-10-31 22:03:17,"Announcing a New Class at the Ahmanson Lab.

Come play with cutting-edge technologies and explore the impact of simulation on society!



**Simulation and Society**

    CORE 499
    Spring 2025
    2 Units
    Thursdays 1:00PM-2:50PM
    At the Ahmanson Lab (LVL 301)
    Dr. Curtis Fletcher

 

Some technological developments can appear near totalistic in the way they remake how we think‚Äîthey permeate everything, including deeply rooted perspectives about knowledge, politics, society, and even reality. Simulation is one such set of technologies.

 

This course offers students the opportunity to engage with technologies of simulation‚Äîranging from extended reality and generative AI to big data modeling‚Äîto examine the shifting nature of human values, interactions, and attitudes in the early 21st century. In doing so, the course will guide students through a comprehensive, interdisciplinary study of virtual worlds, preparing them to engage with our increasingly simulated digital spaces in critical and informed ways.

 

Students in the course will also take advantage of technologies available at the Ahmanson Lab, including XR technologies, generative AI tools, bot systems, and a brain-computer interface, to gain knowledge and hands-on experience while engaging with the themes of the course.

 

Through readings, discussions, and the thoughtful, hands-on application of relevant technologies at the Ahmanson Lab, students will examine the evolution of virtual worlds, from their origins in early mechanical simulations, stereoscopic technologies, and early film, to present-day immersive digital environments; the philosophical questions raised by VR, immersive environments, and the Simulation Hypothesis; the ""end of theory"" as big data models and AI replace deep theoretical understanding with predictive simulations; and the social and political implications of virtual worlds, including the ability to counterfeit people and simulate human behavior at scale.

How much does it typically cost to be in a sorority per semester? Are scholarships available?

Would is be accepted that I am not a huge partier? I do love to go to parties like every other week but I'm not a big drinker.

Are single rooms available for new members? I currently have single accommodations at USC housing and would prefer to continue having my own room. Also, would it make a difference if I lived in the house or continued living in USC housing?

I am mixed(white and hispanic)/curvy and have been a bit worried about how that would be with the whole thin white sorority girl stereotype because I wouldn't really fit it and I am active in my cultural communities and not down for passive aggressive comments about my body type.

What is the time commitment like? I'm in several extracurriculars, have an internship, and have classes so I don't have a ton of spare time.

Also, is there hazing? I know everywhere says there isn't but with all the frat stuff that's come out this semester I'm wondering how it really is with the sororities.

Honestly I'm mainly interested to meet more people, have a bigger group of friends (I feel like all my friends right now don't really mesh with each other so I have individual friendships but not friend groups), and have more fun - like I said I'm not a big partier drinking wise but I do love the social aspect of parties and events.

That being said, I would love if you could recommend classes for me to take or advise me to avoid.

Everyday, when I put on my Cardinal and Gold sweatshirt that I overpayed for from a bespoke Newport Beach consignment store, I feel a sense of pride ever so thoroughly reinforced by my seven dollar Dulce matcha latte I waited thirty minutes in line for. These ‚Äúcoffee made at home‚Äù drinkers don‚Äôt know the pride I have in spending someone else‚Äôs money on excess calories that I burn off while doing light cardio, clad in one of my six matching workout sets, of which I only rotate through my two favorites.

I take my studies very seriously, as any true Trojan should, but only during midterms and finals. My exams never stood a chance, since it is only fair to myself and my fellow classmates that I get the complete maximum out of my bare minimum.

I took a look at the CSBA curriculum and there's less CS content so I was curious if it was easier? I don't mind taking some hard courses, but I don't want that to be my entire schedule for the next 1-3 years. I actually really enjoy programming (in CS-103 right now, and I have some past experience in other languages), so I want to switch into something that would let me stick with that interest yet maintain the will to live. Also, I think being a project manager would be more suited to my skills. I like talking with interesting people and I like coding, and I'm decent at coding but I'm not a prodigy (although I know most project manager don't actually code). 

TL;DR: Is CSBA easier? I've never taken a business class so I'm not sure what they're like and I assume it isn't all the business major stereotypes."

It‚Äôs one thing to get rejected from internships/jobs. But it‚Äôs another to get rejected from clubs in \*\*college\*\* that you‚Äôre genuinely interested in and want to find a strong community with. Before you say nobodys forcing me to join these clubs, i was tweaking while writing this instead of my paper.

Note; Two fun clubs that are always recommended on this subreddit are escapesc (make escape rooms,it‚Äôs literally the top comments on all these posts) and kxsc (radio club) and they both require essays and an interview. Idk if i get denied from an escape room club that would be my last straw fr

>

During the interview there were a bunch of stations of diff interviewers andi had to rotate between two groups of them. and after some basic ques they asked some ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù ones like¬†

‚ÄúWhich one of us would you save from a stranded island, you can only pick one‚Äù

‚ÄúName a red flag you think each of us has‚Äù

‚ÄúTell us a song you like‚Äù and then they asked to sing it¬†

‚ÄúTell me a joke‚Äù

‚ÄúGuess my rice purity score‚Äù

Random ass requests like ‚Äúgo in the middle of the room and shout i love apo‚Äù and ‚Äúgo up to another interviewer and dab on them‚Äù and ‚Äúgo to another interviewer and propose to them‚Äù and ‚Äúgo to another interviewer and touch their shoes‚Äù¬†

>helenes -- ""hosts of usc"", does a lot of dei, service, and spirit events. they really really emphasized how they're like a tight knit family in their interest events. technically i didnt get rejected bc i gave up when i saw the requirements. 

1. Get a 90% on written test where you have to memorize 2+ pages of content
2. Five short essays
3. Interview with all the board members (\~15) and someone i know who got in said they only only took 50% of the people they interviewed. My friend who's more intelligent/eloquent than me didn't get in so I would've been cooked either way LOL

People also recommended student assemblies on this subreddit and that went super well¬†for me

Apasa (asian student assembly, culture assembly that helps plan aapi events): \*three essays, resume, and two rounds of interviews(amazing)\*

* This was my most disappointing rejection‚Ä¶ I went to the hour-long info session and most of it was just the members talking about how they made some of their closest friends here, did a lot of bonding events together, and found a safe space to express their AAPI identity.¬†
* I also knew SO many people in the club. I walked into the interview and it was four people interviewing me (and they were all in my grade as well so there was mutual recognition as well)

-First-generation student assembly; also four essays and when i went to the interview there were seven people in total but only three were asking questions and the other people were taking notes which is also amazing¬†

I havent even bothered applying to the marshall/cs clubs which require case studies interviews, more board interviews, take home projects, accept 20 out 70 people in a 1:2 interview to move on to \*group interview\* (sparksc) &&&&&&&. Maybe it‚Äôll sound salty saying most of these ppl i see on linkedin in these are rich/60k+ private schools but that‚Äôs a lot in this school and will be like that irl. Went to an innodate info session and the whole time they were like we‚Äôre super chill and don‚Äôt need experience but they want a portfolio, essays, take home assignment thing, two rounds of interviews (one group/one individual). Also got rejected/accepted into a bunch of other stuff but this is already way too long.¬†"

Transfer from MSCS General to Game Dev,https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/1g2evnk/transfer_from_mscs_general_to_game_dev/,8,9,2024-10-13 01:31:31,"Minor Edits: Got some more information but I still would like some opinions

Current student at USC in the MSCS - General track. Anyone have some opinions about transferring from MSCS general track to Game Dev track or vice versa? Would love to hear your thoughts on why you made the decision and if it was worth it.

Personally, I'm considering making the jump. My friends getting some careers in Game Dev influenced me a bit, as well as seeing more posts about how valuable the Game Dev network is at USC due to it being much smaller than General MSCS. I saw the Advanced Game Projects showcases from previous years, and I'd love to work on something like that. However, I think I could do that even as a General track MSCS student. 

The main courses I'd be looking at are CTIN 488 (Game Design Workshop) and CTIN 532L (Interactive Design and Production). One is making a tabletop game with the intention of understanding good game design. The other from what I can tell is learning to collaborate with a team to design games. If I were to stay in MSCS - General, I would instead have some filler classes like Search Engines and Database Systems. I was already planning on taking some of the Game Dev overlap classes anyway, like CSCI 580 (3D Graphics), CSCI 538 (VR) and CSCI 522 (Game Engine Development). 

I have a bunch of amateur solo and team passion projects for personal improvement and for game jams. Some of them included presenting to companies as part of the competition, so I have a bit of an idea about marketing and advertisement. I've worked with Unity, Unreal Engine 4, and Blender. Meanwhile, for General track, my experience is a lot more limited. I only had a simple IT job, and it didn't lead me anywhere really. I think my passion for Game Dev would carry me a lot further.

I know Game Dev is a much more volatile industry, but I'd be willing to take the jump to the Game Dev track I'm just not sure if it's worth much more than staying in MSCS - General track."

On the other hand, I don't know if parking at USC is bad or not, and I definitely know LA traffic is HORRIBLE. In addition, I believe I'd have more flexibility with the type of classes I'd be able to take if I lived on campus versus driving an hour.

How did a business degree from USC help you in becoming an entrepreneur? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/1fwfz2w/how_did_a_business_degree_from_usc_help_you_in/,17,13,2024-10-05 02:09:06,"I am a new transfer student at USC. My goal is to have my own business someday. I have been grappling with my class schedule because I feel like my classes are not focusing on the preparation needed for being an entrepreneur. I was excited to apply to USC because they offer an entrepreneurial emphasis for undergraduate students. I came to find out that this entails taking 3 entrepreneurial emphasis electives. I would really love to take more entrepreneurial classes to help prepare me for the start up process and the knowledge needed to manage a business. My question is‚Ä¶how has your degree helped you in starting up your own business and/or helping you develop the mindset of an entrepreneur? Do you feel like it was worth the time, money and effort to get a business degree as an entrepreneur? Did the Trojan network help you? I am feeling conflicted at the moment because my classes this semester are not what I envisioned. I would love to hear from any USC graduates on how your undergraduate business degree helped you as an entrepreneur. Any advice on this topic would be greatly appreciated."

Here‚Äôs a bit of background about me:



Age: 30

Degrees: I have a BA in Philosophy (focused on ethics and public policy) and an AS in Business.

Current Role: I‚Äôm working part-time at a health tech startup as the Head of Product Support, but I also handle a lot of operational tasks. Before this, I spent about 4 years as a General Manager at a restaurant in Los Angeles.

Certifications: I‚Äôll have a Technology Management Program (TMP) Certificate from UCSB by next year.

Back to School: I went back to school recently and will be graduating in June 2025.

Why Supply Chain?: I‚Äôve become more interested in supply chain management because of my background in operations, tech, and ethical decision-making. I think it would be a great next step, but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs the right fit for me now.

I‚Äôd love to get some perspectives from people who have experience in the supply chain industry, especially those who‚Äôve gone through USC‚Äôs MS GSCM program or similar programs. Do you think this is a good career move considering my age and background? Is the investment worth it, and how well would my degrees and work experience align with what the program offers?

Also what is a competitive gpa range? I'm at a 3.55 right now but could bring it up."

Professor denying student old records,https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/1fs0dc3/professor_denying_student_old_records/,1,4,2024-09-29 09:15:15,"I took a SWE class last semester and deleted my own code copies to save space for classes this semester. Now with SWE recruiting in full swing, I'm currently making my own website to showcase my projects and realized that I have a really beefy website that I can show from last semester which I don't have. I requested my code from the professor who taught the course however he said that any class code should not be posted publicly because of academic integrity. I don't care about posting the code on the internet, I just want to publish the website so I have something to show. 

After doing some research into the USC student handbook, students do have the right to access old records through a written request to the university. I'm wondering what steps I can take to get my code back if possible and if it is even worth negotiating with this prof?"

And before anyone asks, I have no idea what I did wrong. I‚Äôm a post bacc student, meaning, I haven‚Äôt done chemistry in well over 8 years since I‚Äôve been in hs. I got a B+ in chem in hs by barely studying and having a tough grader as a teacher. Here I am, almost 10 years later trying to finish my premed reqs and not knowing what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I even took a chemistry bootcamp over summer! I do all my assignments and study for chem at least 2 hours a day. I am on campus 8 hours at a time studying for bio + chem and I STILL managed to fail. I studied every morning before classes and after to prep and even made a workbook explaining each problem step by step days in advance. And then I got my exam, and I second guessed myself and ran out of time‚Ä¶so I had to guess on most of them. I have diagnosed ADHD and am most definitely applying for accommodations because I have never experienced running out of time before. I‚Äôm now absolutely panicking because I have a sinking feeling in my chest that maybe I‚Äôm just not capable and realized that A, is out the window and I‚Äôd be lucky to get a B. What do I do?
