Can't recommend getting a meal plan anymore...,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/1gwlhcm/cant_recommend_getting_a_meal_plan_anymore/,45,5,2024-11-21 17:51:46,"I can no longer recommend getting a meal plan. When I was a freshman (a junior now), the meal plan offered decent value‚Äîyou could get a reasonable meal almost anywhere in the Reitz or the Hub. Sure, the portions were small, but at least they were complete meals. Now, the options are severely limited. You're restricted to 1 of 3 six-inch subs at Subway, a smoothie at Shake Smart, or just going to the dining halls, where the food quality is mediocre at best.

Cravings used to be a highlight‚Äîit let you get a meal, dessert, and a drink, similar to the dining halls, and the quality was pretty good. But now, you have to pay extra for both the dessert AND the drink, as if it isn‚Äôt just a soda. You‚Äôd think having Flex Bucks would help, but those run out quickly.

And let‚Äôs not forget the limitations of the off-campus plan: you‚Äôre restricted to one meal swipe a day and often end up with unused swipes by the end of the semester. It‚Äôs frustrating how much the meal plan has deteriorated‚Äîit just doesn‚Äôt feel worth it anymore. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if at one point they make it so you can only use them at dining halls."

I changed my majors to make my parents happy but I‚Äôm so miserable. I don‚Äôt really care about my hobbies, partly because I‚Äôm depressed and also because my parents relentlessly shit on me for them.im not really good at anything, my grades are mediocre, and my personality is awful. Everywhere I look, it feels like I‚Äôm operating in a world that doesn‚Äôt want me in it, yknow? Or wasn‚Äôt  built for me. I‚Äôm in the verge of tears right now. My parents are happy that I‚Äôm studying something useful (information systems) but in reality I have no idea what I‚Äôm going to with ,y life. I can‚Äôt even pass a fast food interview because (imo) I‚Äôm autistic in the painfully obvious, disgusting way. And since I‚Äôm a girl, people just think I‚Äôm weird or a walking red flag. I‚Äôve never had any friends in my entire life. I struggle to communicate irl and also online. I can‚Äôt ever get my ideas through straight unless I‚Äôm writing fiction or theses. Essays? Short stories? Stellar. Trying to communicate with another human being directly? Hardly know her.

I originally wanted to become an English teacher (TEFL) because I grew up overseas and my English teachers were pretty much my only support system. During my first semester, I was enrolled in several literature courses and took two semesters of Chinese. I loved the language  so much that Ive continued even though my parents disapprove and bully me for it. 

It seems so delusional now, but I wanted to be an English teacher in Vietnam , Japan, or China. I wanted to get a masters in literature. My first two semesters at UF, when I was still enrolled as an English major, were the only semesters where I attended class regularly (there were days where i didn‚Äôt  make it to class because of my anxiety and got scolded, especially by my Chinese professor, but I was working on it). I also was trying to make friends. I‚Äôm a junior now and I haven‚Äôt been to a physical classroom in nearly a year. This semester, it‚Äôs been a been nearly a month since I‚Äôve watched a single lecture. I am taking easier classes since I got burnt out doing 60 hrs a week over the summer, but my motivation has disappeared. I just feel so lonely. I don‚Äôt how to communicate or who to speak to. I don‚Äôt have friends, therapy has been a bust, and even posting online has become too overstimulating. I don‚Äôt really leave the house at all anymore. I just miss that person who wa so excited to go to UF. I feel empty and worthless now. And I know that once I graduate I‚Äôll probably end up doing minimum wage labor for the rest of my life . Go look at the statistics for post graduate autistic people. And looking back, I‚Äôm probably too dumb to be a teacher or do any thing worthwhile 

And before you say I got into UF so I must be smart, I didn‚Äôt even have  any noteworthy achievements; no clubs, no ECs, nothing, I got in because I write a fancy essay. Sorry if this ranty, I‚Äôm going to go crawl into a fetal position and cry now "

I was talking to some people recently and realized that we hold very different views on things, but everyone seems to be trying to reach what they feel is the logical conclusion. Because of this, I was thinking it would be fun to have occasional get-togethers next semester, where I‚Äôll grab a couple of pizzas and create an environment with no recording and no hostility, allowing us to discuss topics that interest us in the hopes of seeing things from a new perspective.
The topics could range from serious issues like how to handle immigration or political candidates to more trivial ones, such as what the best library on campus is or what love is. I thought we could have a group doc or something similar, where everyone can suggest topic ideas, and then we vote on 2 or 3 to discuss at each meeting.
I‚Äôm wondering if this is the kind of thing anyone would be interested in, since the whole idea is to bring together random people who have different views‚Äîboth from myself and each other‚Äîto have a thoughtful discussion. In addition, since I consider myself a moderate leaning conservative over the first few meetings I am considering finding someone moderate leaning liberal to help moderate to ensure everything is fair.

I applied as an AA transfer after I got rejected from my Freshman application because I would be graduating highschool with my AA and all the requirements for the Psych program. I got rejected again on the grounds of not being competitive enough. I ended up going to the University of North Georgia and I absolutely hate it here and decided to transfer because everyone goes home every weekend leaving the whole campus dead. I applied as a transfer student to USF and UF. I just go my decision back from UF and I got REJECTED again because I was not competitive enough. I didn't understand why because I though I had all the prerequisites, a 4.0 GPA, and I am a Florida resident. Turns out I am missing 2 credits of a Trig class that my advisor failed to tell me about and I didn't realize that I need 1140 (I have this one) plus 1114 (turns out I don't have this one) to equal 1147 ( 5 credits).

So, basically now I have to decide do I go to USF and either stay there and hope I like it or take the trig class and apply to UF in hopes I will actually get in this time. I am just worried that It will look bad to have 3 colleges that I went to if I go that route of going to USF and hopefully transferring to UF because I already have UNG on my transcript. Or do I take the class at my local community college (that I did dual enrollment at) and work for a semester and reapply because all the admissions officers basically told me that I would be competitive after I have that credit and would get in. I am just worried if I take the one class at the community college and on the slight chance I don't get into UF I would have no college to go to. It has always been my dream to go to UF so I am afraid if I don't try again with all the prerequisites met  I will always regret it. Any and all advice is helpful. Also if you guys like USF versus UF or your experiences there I would appreciate hearing about it. Thank you!!!"

UF traditional or UF online?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/1gsf6d6/uf_traditional_or_uf_online/,2,18,2024-11-16 04:12:28,"Hey all, 

I‚Äôm currently a CC student wanting to attend UF and earn a degree in Business Administration. But I am deciding between UF Online and UF traditional. 

Currently, where I am at, I have a part time job at a very large retail company that I enjoy working at and I have the opportunity to become assistant manager at this store. If I earned the promotion and worked full time I would be making around 50-60k a year + bonuses. I have no expenses and don‚Äôt pay rent (live at home). I want to pursue UF Online in order to work full time and finish my degree. 

Is there really a difference between UF online and traditional UF degree programs in terms of degree ‚Äúprestige‚Äù or ‚Äúrespect‚Äù? Additionally I‚Äôve lived nearby the Gainesville area my whole life so I don‚Äôt really feel a disconnect there. I‚Äôm very attracted to the program and I would only have to pay 7k for the 60 credits needed to finish my bachelors.

My ultimate goal is to pursue my MBA and use the degree and experience I gained in retail in order to gain admission to an MBA program and eventually work at the corporate level at the company I am at. 

Can anyone speak from their experience how UF online was vs traditional UF. And the downsides from obtaining the degree this way? 

Any and all answers or feedback is appreciated. "

In freshmen year, i got rejected for a position I interviewed for, and when I asked for feedback, they gave it to me. And in sophomore year, I was able to re-apply and get the position. So the point is.....without knowing what I need to improve on for MOC, I just feel depressed about getting rejected for a 3rd time if i apply again in spring without knowing what I am doing wrong.

My best scores combined were a 760 english, 600 math, superscore 1360. 

I want to go into physics. I know my low math score probably makes me look bad at it but I really love the subject.

I'm an AP scholar (No 5's but three 4's and one 3) with what will be 7 AP classes when I graduate (AP WH, APUSH, AP Lang, AP Psych, AP LIT, AP Pre Calc & AP Gov)  

My GPA isn't great, but if it helps I went from a slack off, C average student freshman and sophomore year to a student who hasn't received a grade less than an A since junior. The pickup is pretty insane, you can look at my academic history on skyward and see D, C, C, B, A, F, and then all of the sudden nothing but A's. Not even a progress report below one. No significant change in the difficulty of my classes either, because junior & senior year I took more AP's than ever before.) I centered my essay around self efficacy and how I taught myself to love math and be productive with pretty much no resources. I'm hoping it will draw attention to the sharp turn in performance. For what it's worth, I think my essay was great (but so does everyone so my opinion on it is kinda worthless). 

I have well over 400 hours of community service logged. So far only 440 something, but my 4-H paperwork should tip me past 550. I know that's stuff's important to UF. In terms of extracurriculars, I'm president of my school's theater troupe, & I've done choir for four years. I've been on multi state 4-H planning committees and helped plan the two biggest ones in Florida. My experience with 4-H is inextricably tied to UF as a college because they sponsor it, and they're pretty ""nepotistic"" about that program. I've done all sorts of workshops with 4-H on their campuses, getting to know CALS professors and so on. 

As for connections, my brother went to UF (they paid HIM to go to grad school there). I don't know if family ties help at all and I don't remember if I mentioned it (I think there is a section for it) but he was the editor in chief of florida law review a few years ago so it's a solid connection. 

I don't know what else we're supposed to put on these things other than that I know for a fact I got great letters of recommendation from my NAF + RTX employer, as well as teachers. I've never posted on reddit before so I apologize if I mentioned anything unnecessary or left something out.

So I recently failed my physics 2 exam, and it seems I will have to retake the class for the spring.

- the engines are so small that in order to run them at 25-35 mph, you‚Äôre running the engines as hard as they can go, leading to short lifecycles

- you‚Äôre limited to the top speed of 25-35mph (depending on model)

- scooters and motorcycles get approximately the same fuel economy, provided that you‚Äôre not driving your motorcycle at 100mph

- you can keep a motorcycle for far longer than just ‚Äúyour college days,‚Äù meaning that this purchase will help you build wealth in the long run

- used motorcycles cost about the same to a little more than scooters

- the risk is about the same, as scooter accidents are still typically fatal to riders, even when at low speeds

I sold my motorcycle several years ago after I watched a friend lose his leg in an accident, but if you‚Äôre going to purchase a 2-wheeled vehicle, I urge you to consider a motorcycle instead of a scooter. (Just always bear in mind that 80% of all motorcycle/scooter accidents are fatal to the person on the bike/scooter - yes, even at low speeds; another friend died in a low speed scooter accident)

As for what you should look for: there are tons of great options, but Honda has the most reliable engines in the world (not conjecture; that‚Äôs an actual stat) so I‚Äôd start by looking for something like a Rebel 300/500 or a CB300R (brand new, these bikes are around/under $4,000; they‚Äôre even cheaper used)"

UF's Tax LLM Employment Outcomes (from UK LLB),https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/1glxpdp/ufs_tax_llm_employment_outcomes_from_uk_llb/,0,2,2024-11-07 18:42:11,"Hi everyone!

I'm in a unique situation as a Canadian citizen attending a UK LLB program and looking at US Tax LLM programs. I originally went to my school in the UK because I had a unique full-ride opportunity out of high school, and I‚Äôm a competitive athlete in a niche sport that is popular here. The thing is, I want to move to the US to practice and am curious about my pathways to doing so.

As a Canadian, I fortunately don‚Äôt have any work visa concerns as a lawyer in the US, due to the TN Visa. Also, as a Canadian, I am eligible for in-state tuition at any Florida university under the Florida-Canada Linkage program. I‚Äôve done some internships in both finance and law, and I have a strong interest in tax long-term. So, with no visa concerns and tuition at UF being very reasonable, what would be my potential prospects out of their Tax LLM program coming from an international LLB?

I know UF participates in TIP/TARE, but from your experiences, what is the likely outcome? Biglaw in any US region is my goal, but I recognize that it may be an unlikely outcome (or not?). Is Big 4 the most likely landing spot?

Also, in terms of geography, I don‚Äôt have a problem staying in Florida post-graduation, but what is the portability to other states/cities, namely NY, CA, TX, etc.?

Lastly, what are your general opinions of this plan, and if it‚Äôs feasible? I know some will say, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you start in the UK and move later in your career?‚Äù or ‚ÄúJust do a JD,‚Äù which I appreciate are great options for my goals to practice in the US, but I‚Äôm mainly curious about this approach in this instance.

Thank you!!"

In addition to undergrads, this year, we are also opening the program more widely to graduate students! It's a great way to get some summer credit when classes are not usually offered (at least in computing).

\-Live in Japan for 12 weeks while completing degree coursework (but check with advisor)  
\-Connect to the local industry and startup culture  
\-Offered in Summer 2025, Fall 2025, Spring 2026, and each semester after (subject to demand)

Prior Japanese language experience ***is not required***, but all students take a Japanese language course. Higher levels also offered. If you have questions, please feel free to reach out to me!

We even called the DMV to check on the plate and there was no record of it in the system, and they are the ones who told us to file a complaint and look into legal action, seeing as the scooter we purchased isn't legal.

Finally went in to discuss a potential refund and was constantly interrupted by the owner and spoken down to. At one point he looked at my husband and said ""I'd be willing to help but the way she's acting I don't want to mess with it"", when I was literally just asking about the title and tag that we are legally entitled to. He then raised his voice and said ""I'm getting your title, I don't know what else you want from me"", I finally told him not to yell at me, he yelled ‚Äúfuck off and leave my shop.

I'm currently torn between two major options and could really use some advice. The BME curriculum (based on the model semester plan) aligns with my interests, and I like how biologically focused the field is. My main concern is job prospects after graduation, since BME is a relatively new field and seems more specialized which could limit my options.

On the other hand, MechE is much broader, and with a Biomechanics minor, I could still pursue BME-related jobs while keeping my options open in other areas. The downside is that the MechE curriculum doesn‚Äôt align with my interests as well as the BME one, even including the electives I could take with the minor. I‚Äôm also not sure how I feel about courses like aerospace design, vibrations, heat transfer, etc. 

Another thing I was considering was the intensity of the curriculum. BME seems really intense for the first three semesters (taking chem plus physics plus calc every semester) whereas MechE stops after Chem 1, so the first three semesters seem less intense. But in terms of the semesters after that, BME seems more interesting and fun to me than MechE.  

For anyone currently in these programs at UF, could you share your experiences? How are the classes, and what are the job prospects (both undergrad and post-grad) in each field?

A GOP-Backed Center Stoked Faculty Paranoia at the U. of Florida. Then Ben Sasse Got Mad.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/1gjqocl/a_gopbacked_center_stoked_faculty_paranoia_at_the/,117,28,2024-11-04 22:04:25,"[https://www.chronicle.com/article/oath-of-fealty](https://www.chronicle.com/article/oath-of-fealty)

Ben Sasse was angry.

It was the spring of 2024, and the University of Florida‚Äôs new Hamilton Center for Classical and Civic Education was getting off the ground. Sasse, then the university‚Äôs president, was a self-described ‚Äúzealot‚Äù of the center, a Republican-backed venture to teach students about the Western canon and civil discourse.

But the rollout was hitting roadblocks. Several graduate students had complained that liberal-arts faculty were targeting them for affiliating with the Hamilton Center. There were murmurs that humanities departments would block its curricular proposals. The center‚Äôs director later described some professors‚Äô conduct as ‚Äúabuses.‚Äù

So Sasse spoke to David Richardson, then dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. According to two academic leaders who received nearly identical accounts of the conversation, Sasse gave the dean an ultimatum: Deal with it, or he would absorb the liberal-arts college into the Hamilton Center. In one of those accounts, Sasse said Richardson‚Äôs job was on the line.

A third academic leader said that all they could disclose about the exchange was that it was ‚Äúunpleasant.‚Äù

Sasse‚Äôs ultimatum was at odds with the Hamilton Center‚Äôs original pitch as an independent academic unit ‚Äî one that would collaborate with UF‚Äôs liberal-arts college. The center would ‚Äúbuild on existing strengths,‚Äù its inaugural director said.

But for most of the last academic year, the Hamilton Center was locked in a behind-the-scenes turf war with the college. The center said faculty members waged an active campaign against it, stifling its progress and discriminating against its students. Some liberal-arts faculty countered that the center was duplicating their established departments‚Äô offerings and shirking typical university protocols.

The clash culminated in a¬†[university investigation](https://www.chronicle.com/article/u-of-florida-investigates-whether-professors-interfered-with-western-civ-center)¬†into whether six liberal-arts faculty members had ‚Äúinterfered‚Äù with the Hamilton Center ‚Äî a probe that threatened disciplinary action up to termination.¬†*The Chronicle‚Äôs*¬†reporting is based on over a dozen interviews with university officials and rank-and-file faculty, and scores of emails and documents obtained through public-records requests and those involved.

Florida is among half a dozen states where civics schools and centers with Republican ties have sprung up, envisioned as an antidote to concerns that left-leaning humanities professors are turning away from Western thought and that conservative scholars are underrepresented. National faculty advocates have sounded alarms about the new units, which they see as a troubling injection of political influence into teaching.

Sasse‚Äôs conversation with Richardson, in which the then-president threatened to trample on UF‚Äôs existing liberal-arts programs, encapsulates professors‚Äô fears about the worst-case scenario. So does what happened next.

As some liberal-arts faculty see it, the Hamilton Center‚Äôs opaque origins tarnished it from the start.

The center wasn‚Äôt UF‚Äôs idea. A little-known group called the Council on Public University Reform hired the former chief of staff of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to lobby for the center‚Äôs creation,¬†[*The Chronicle*¬†reported last year](https://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-center-for-civic-education-became-a-political-provocation?sra=true).

The¬†[initial proposal](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262638-hamilton-center_s-initial-proposal?responsive=1&title=1)¬†for the center argued that the fundamental mission of higher education ‚Äî to seek truth ‚Äî was threatened by ‚Äúcancel culture and uniformity of opinion on campus.‚Äù It called for a ‚Äúrobust and fiercely independent center‚Äù at UF that fostered ‚Äúpolitical and intellectual diversity‚Äù and a ‚Äútraditional liberal education in the Great Books that form the foundation of Western intellectual tradition.‚Äù

The Hamilton Center ‚Äî named for the founding father ‚Äî would exist outside any departments or colleges and offer its own courses and interdisciplinary degree programs, per the initial proposal. A board of advisers would provide a list of initial faculty hires to the university‚Äôs Board of Trustees, which would make final selections. If the center‚Äôs faculty were to be hired through existing departments, the proposal said, ‚Äúthe result would be a replication of what already exists.‚Äù

After the former DeSantis aide delivered the proposal to the university in January 2022, a lengthy deliberation ensued. Joseph Glover, the then-provost, argued the proposal laid out ‚Äúa conservative agenda to influence the curriculum‚Äù and did ‚Äúnot align well‚Äù with administrative and faculty governance structures. Edits were made, the proposal was OK‚Äôd, and by July, the center had been established, had a director, and was equipped with a $3 million start-up injection from the Legislature.

The Hamilton Center entered UF in a period of transition. Kent Fuchs, then the president, and Glover were on their way out. Sasse, who succeeded Fuchs in February 2023, became the center‚Äôs biggest champion, jockeying to fast-track its development. Less than four months after taking office, he replaced the center‚Äôs inaugural director with William Inboden ‚Äî a close friend of 30 years and a historian of the American presidency and the Cold War at the University of Texas at Austin. Sasse, a former Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, also leveraged his political acumen with the Florida Legislature to bolster the center‚Äôs recurring state funding to $10 million. He even co-taught a course at the center, ‚ÄúThe American Idea,‚Äù last spring.

While building up the center, he also rejected the notion that it was a partisan project. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just classically liberal,‚Äù Sasse said in June of this year. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not right of center. We‚Äôre not interested in your politics.‚Ä¶We‚Äôre wrestling with big questions here, and political indoctrination is boring.‚Äù He also described the center‚Äôs broad disciplinary lens as a remedy for the ‚Äúnichification‚Äù of humanities scholarship.

Not all faculty were convinced.¬†[Some still feared](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262634-faculty-fears-report?responsive=1&title=1)¬†the Hamilton Center was a Trojan Horse for the state‚Äôs conservative agenda and would siphon resources from existing units. A few months after the center was established, an¬†[anonymous swath](https://fora.aa.ufl.edu/docs/78/2023-2024/Report%20of%20the%20Ad%20Hoc%20Task%20Force%20on%20Shared%20Governance%20draft%20with%20survey%20results-Final.pdf)¬†of liberal-arts and law professors told the Faculty Senate that they feared the center was a ‚Äúshadow college‚Äù meant to replace humanities departments without faculty input, and now regarded university officials who helped in its creation as ‚Äúagents of the state.‚Äù

Last fall, the center offered 10 courses and housed more than a dozen faculty and staff members. But Republican power brokers have higher aspirations for the center. Beginning in 2025, the center is required by law to report its progress toward becoming a fully fledged school ‚Äî Hamilton College ‚Äî within the university. To get majors off the ground by 2025, approvals needed to begin in the spring of 2024 and would require the support of departments where there may be curricular overlap.

In other words: The Hamilton Center had to convince some of its biggest skeptics in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to sign off.

When Inboden, the Hamilton Center‚Äôs new director, presented to liberal-arts faculty about the center‚Äôs two inaugural majors ‚Äî Great Books and Ideas, and Philosophy, Politics, Economics, and Law ‚Äî he was met with silence and ‚Äúblank stares,‚Äù according to a faculty member in attendance.

Later, an associate dean relayed to a Hamilton Center associate director that humanities departments would be ‚Äúupset‚Äù if the majors were approved.

Then, when two Hamilton Center courses came up for review by the university‚Äôs General Education Committee, its co-chair ‚Äî a classics professor ‚Äî subverted the standard process. The co-chair asked at least two humanities department heads to evaluate whether the center‚Äôs courses overlapped with their departments‚Äô existing offerings. But the General Education Committee wasn‚Äôt supposed to have authority over such consultations.

The fact that humanities chairs got involved at that stage angered Inboden, who later called the decision a ‚Äúdeliberate violation‚Äù of usual curricular protocols, ‚Äúdespite being strongly urged against doing so by multiple senior officials in the provost‚Äôs office.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Hamilton Center officials had been talking to humanities graduate students over several months about their interest in the center‚Äôs Graduate Fellows program. Those conversations revealed concerns about facing backlash from their home departments, including English, history, and anthropology.

One graduate student believed that if her home department were to find out about her Hamilton Center ties, ‚Äúshe would lose important friends, mentors, and allies necessary for her to pursue academic excellence,‚Äù according to an email from Inboden to Sasse describing the students‚Äô complaints.

Another student said that his department had ‚Äúmany faculty members who hate the Hamilton Center and would not be happy at all should a student affiliate themselves‚Äù with it. The student also thanked the center‚Äôs academic specialist for meeting with him at an off-campus coffee shop, ‚Äúaway from people who might see us.‚Äù

A third student said his department ‚Äúhas essentially dissociated from him.‚Äù

A separate complaint suggested that, in one case, a faculty member had acted on their biases. A prospective doctoral student told his mentor, who had recently been hired by the Hamilton Center, that the history department‚Äôs graduate coordinator had rejected his transfer request to UF. Moreover, the student claimed he was told that his mentor would ‚Äúnot be able to be involved‚Äù in his research in ‚Äúany way‚Äù because she was a Hamilton Center faculty member.

Inboden was ‚Äúpretty shocked to hear about the abuses that came to light in the past week,‚Äù he told Richardson, the liberal-arts dean, in an email at the time. ‚ÄúI was very familiar with the vocal opposition to the Hamilton Center expressed by many \[College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\] faculty but had not realized that in some cases it extended to targeting graduate students and applicants,‚Äù Inboden said. ‚ÄúHopefully further investigation will provide the full picture.‚Äù

As the Hamilton Center‚Äôs grievances grew, Sasse gave Richardson the ultimatum, threatening to dissolve the liberal-arts college unless his faculty stopped meddling with the center. Once Sasse got involved, one faculty member said, the dynamic between the liberal-arts college and the Hamilton Center ‚Äúbecame a whole different animal.‚Äù

One academic leader who received an account of the conversation wrote at the time that Sasse planned to follow through on his threat if anyone in the college either criticized the Hamilton Center or insisted that its curricular proposals go through regular university procedures, according to email records. That faculty member didn‚Äôt respond to an interview request.

Jon Sensbach, chair of the history department, told¬†*The Chronicle*¬†that he spoke with two people with direct knowledge of Sasse‚Äôs exchange with Richardson and that Sasse had been ‚Äúlivid.‚Äù He declined to publicly identify the sources because they feared professional repercussions.

Whether or not Sasse planned to follow through on the threat, ‚Äúit seems to have served as a way to intimidate the dean into taking drastic steps,‚Äù Sensbach said.

Neither Richardson nor Sasse responded to¬†*The Chronicle‚Äôs*¬†interview requests or an emailed list of questions, including ones about details of their conversation. A university spokesperson also didn‚Äôt answer questions about what Sasse said.

The exchange quickly became the center of gossip among faculty. At a Faculty Senate meeting in March, a philosophy professor asked whether humanities departments would be ‚Äúsiphoned off‚Äù into the Hamilton Center. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping that this is a silly rumor that has no basis in fact,‚Äù the professor said, ‚Äúbut God knows what might be going on.‚Äù

Scott Angle, the provost, responded that while there was a ‚Äúquite a dynamic environment of events‚Äù between the center and the liberal-arts college that have ‚Äúkicked off these wildfires,‚Äù plans for a merger were ‚Äúnot going anywhere.‚Äù But with Sasse, Angle continued, ‚Äúliterally everything is on the table.‚Äù

Meanwhile Richardson, who was no stranger to¬†[controversies over academic freedom](https://www.chronicle.com/article/u-of-florida-dean-says-he-was-directed-to-reject-professors-request-to-testify-against-the-state?sra=true), was trying to do damage control.

‚ÄúThe rumor you are hearing is completely false,‚Äù the dean wrote in response to another concerned professor. Then Richardson told his four associate deans that if any of them ‚Äúimplied or touched on this idea with anyone outside of the college office it needs to be corrected.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope none of you were the source of statements that might have led to those rumors,‚Äù he wrote in an email.

Either way, Sasse had put Richardson under the gun.

The dean ‚Äúfully understood the president‚Äôs reaction‚Äù to the graduate students‚Äô complaints and shared his ‚Äúanger and determination to stop the causative behavior,‚Äù he told Inboden in an email. ‚ÄúWe are beginning those corrections.‚Äù

Within days of talking to Sasse, Richardson put in place plans to ensure faculty members‚Äô cooperation with the center.

He scheduled emergency meetings for March 2 ‚Äî a Saturday ‚Äî with the associate deans and seven humanities chairs to discuss ‚Äúthe general range of their faculty‚Äôs thoughts‚Äù on the Hamilton Center‚Äôs curriculum and if they were aware of ‚Äúany unprofessional mentoring of graduate students‚Äù regarding the center.

Coming out of the meetings, some felt targeted. John A. Palmer, chair of the philosophy department. wrote in an email afterward that he was ‚Äúfrankly, offended at being cast as obstructionist.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot that I imagine anyone will care,‚Äù he told an associate dean, to whom Richardson had just assigned all future curricular matters involving the Hamilton Center. Center leaders, Palmer continued, ‚Äúshould be more careful about bad-mouthing UF faculty who have been making genuine efforts since before their arrival at UF to be cooperative with the Hamilton Center.‚Äù

Despite the behind-the-scenes friction, Richardson told Sasse in a written debrief of the meetings that ‚Äúall chairs were forthcoming and reported that they would cooperate‚Äù with the Hamilton Center on curricular matters and ‚Äúcorrecting issues with graduate mentoring.‚Äù He reiterated: ‚ÄúI fully share the president‚Äôs displeasure.‚Äù

The dean would get those promises in writing.

Around 9 p.m. after the Saturday meetings, the seven humanities chairs were directed to sign pledges to cooperate with the center, including giving approvals for its two planned majors. They had less than a week to comply. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs a tight turnaround,‚Äù the associate dean ‚Äî Richardson‚Äôs newly tapped Hamilton Center liaison ‚Äî told the chairs. ‚ÄúI again appreciate your cooperation.‚Äù They could modify the pledge template, the associate dean said, ‚Äúbut the message of supporting/not objecting should be clear.‚Äù

The¬†[pledge template](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262641-pledge-to-cooperate?responsive=1&title=1)¬†included this suggested language: ‚ÄúWe believe that the Hamilton Center curriculum will provide a unique opportunity for students interested in these areas and will complement our department‚Äôs offerings nicely. We have no objection to the implementation of these courses and degrees.‚Äù The template also encouraged chairs to ‚Äúfully support‚Äù having the center‚Äôs faculty serve on graduate committees for master‚Äôs and doctoral students.

That Saturday night marked the first time that Sensbach, the history chair, had seen the Hamilton Center‚Äôs official degree proposals, he told¬†*The Chronicle*, so¬†he felt ‚Äúill-prepared to comment‚Äù on the curriculum. During a meeting the following week with department colleagues, he acknowledged the ‚Äústark choice‚Äù between doing a thorough review and facing possible consequences if they didn‚Äôt sign the pledge.

‚ÄúThey agreed we needed to do that,‚Äù Sensbach said.

All seven chairs¬†[submitted their pledges](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262635-caveats?responsive=1&title=1)¬†by the five-day deadline ‚Äî with some caveats. Only one chair used the draft template. Two omitted language that would have endorsed having Hamilton faculty members serve on their departments‚Äô graduate committees. Five stipulated that they would cooperate with the center as long as its efforts went through ‚Äúofficial channels‚Äù and ‚Äúwell-established procedures.‚Äù

In the midst of that frenzy, three of the department chairs got another message: Richardson had placed them under investigation.

The English, history, and anthropology chairs, as well as the departments‚Äô graduate coordinators, faced allegations that they had ‚Äúinterfered‚Äù with the Hamilton Center. The notices cited university policies regarding¬†[academic freedom](https://hr.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-2024-UFF-UF-Collective-Bargaining-Agreement.pdf)¬†and ‚Äú[disruptive behavior](https://policy.ufl.edu/regulation/1-008/),‚Äù violators of which face¬†[disciplinary action](https://policy.ufl.edu/regulation/7-048/)¬†up to termination.

Sensbach said that being asked to sign an ‚Äúoath of fealty‚Äù to the Hamilton Center while the threat of termination ‚Äúhung over my head‚Äù amounted to ‚Äúarm-twisting.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was being asked to conform to some policy or some ideological position that was being imposed from several layers above,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere was no question in my mind about what I was being forced to do.‚Äù

Sensbach said the 11-week investigation was ‚Äúthe most stressful time‚Äù in his 26-year tenure at UF. He constantly feared the university was monitoring his emails. He had trouble sleeping.

The history chair wasn‚Äôt a foe of the Hamilton Center. The scholar of colonial America and the American Revolution didn‚Äôt think it was a problem that the center‚Äôs curricular offerings overlapped with his department.

But he understood the more critical views. The university‚Äôs humanities departments have had to ‚Äúscratch and scramble‚Äù to hire faculty in recent years, he said, whereas the center had a ‚Äúlavish‚Äù $10-million recruitment stipend from the state. The history department‚Äôs entire budget is $4 million.

A ‚Äújealousy‚Äù toward the center brewed, he said.

‚ÄúThere was a sense that the Hamilton Center and its priorities were being floated ahead of long-standing departments who have been teaching all kinds of subjects, including Western civilization, for decades,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that the Hamilton Center was moving ahead without anybody else‚Äôs input. That generated a lot of resentment.‚Äù

Now Sensbach felt that resentment was being pinned on him.

The investigation concerned whether Sensbach and five other faculty members had ‚Äúengaged in actions or inactions which impaired, interfered with, or obstructed the ability of students to participate in academic programs‚Äù or ‚Äúfaculty members‚Äô ability to teach and/or advise students‚Äù within said programs, according to the notices they received.

It‚Äôs not clear why the history department was targeted, though Sensbach believes one driver may have been the complaint last spring from the prospective graduate student whose transfer application was rejected.

The student‚Äôs complaint alleged that Mitchell Hart, the history graduate coordinator, said there was a ‚Äúgood chance‚Äù the university wouldn‚Äôt accept his application, and that his mentor could not in ‚Äúany way‚Äù be involved with his research at UF because she was a Hamilton Center professor.

But Hart said the rejection was pretty routine and informed by university policies.

In the emailed denial, Hart told the student that he had missed the application deadline for the program, ‚Äúbut was of course free to apply again.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt indicate that the student‚Äôs mentor wouldn‚Äôt be able to be involved with his research but said that she couldn‚Äôt chair his thesis committee. Under¬†[university policy](https://grad.ufl.edu/work/faculty/gfs/#:~:text=Graduate%20faculty%20status%20allows%20University,not%20have%20graduate%20faculty%20status.), a faculty member outside of a student‚Äôs home department can‚Äôt chair their thesis unless they have graduate-faculty status. The student‚Äôs mentor didn‚Äôt meet either requirement.

‚ÄúIt is still unclear what role, if any, someone in the Hamilton Center can play with regard to doctoral committees,‚Äù Hart told the student. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid we are still trying to figure out the relationship, and it is certainly well above my pay grade,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúIt was so banal,‚Äù Hart told¬†*The Chronicle*; he tells prospective graduate students about policies and deadlines 10 times a day. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a very boring job,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the rule. I didn‚Äôt make it, but suddenly I‚Äôm an opponent of the Hamilton Center.‚Äù

When Richardson asked Sensbach about the situation, he forwarded the exchange to the dean. ‚ÄúI thought it was self-explanatory, especially as dean, that he would understand Mitch was following the rules,‚Äù the chair told¬†*The Chronicle*.

Three days later, the dean began investigating Sensbach and Hart anyway. For Hart, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what really pissed me off,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúHe understood that there was nothing there and that it was complete garbage to accuse me or Jon Sensbach of anything, but he went ahead and did it,‚Äù Hart said\*.\*¬†The dean seemed to ‚Äúimply that I had done something misleading, that I had tried to dissuade the student from participating in the Hamilton Center. That‚Äôs complete horseshit.‚Äù

Sidney Dobrin, the chair of the English department, was the first of the six targeted faculty members to be interviewed by human resources. The investigator‚Äôs questions left him at a loss, according to Churchill Roberts, the faculty union‚Äôs grievance-committee chair, who accompanied Dobrin to the March 12 interview.¬†*What were his thoughts on the center? Were his faculty members ‚Äúbad-mouthing‚Äù the Hamilton Center? Had his faculty members targeted students with ties to the center?*¬†(Dobrin didn‚Äôt respond to¬†*The Chronicle‚Äôs*¬†requests for an interview.)

‚ÄúIt was a fishing expedition,‚Äù Roberts said. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt really know what they were looking for.‚Äù

Moreover, the faculty union was filing its own complaints about the matter, and graduate students weren‚Äôt speaking to the investigator.

Less than three weeks after the university launched the probe, the investigator told the targeted faculty members, without explanation, that the remaining interviews were indefinitely postponed.

Sasse publicly trumpeted the investigation in a ‚Äúquick word about academic freedom‚Äù to all faculty in March. He said that he‚Äôd spoken with Richardson, who ‚Äúacknowledged some egregious actions by others in the college and is working to get to the bottom of it.‚Äù

The university, Sasse wrote, depends on its ability to ‚Äúexpose students to a wide range of opinions in an environment free from the fear of reprisal.‚Äù

Later that month, the letter landed in the inbox of Ken McGurn, a multi-million-dollar donor and real-estate developer and lifetime member of the UF Foundation.

The word ‚Äúegregious‚Äù caught his eye.

‚ÄúWhat comes to mind when words like ‚Äòegregious‚Äô and ‚Äòinvestigation‚Äô are used is that someone is a pedophile or beat up a widow or killed someone,‚Äù McGurn told Richardson in an email. ‚ÄúI would sincerely appreciate knowing what actions prompted the use of such inflammatory language.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs a long-term supporter of UF,‚Äù the donor added, ‚ÄúI am very concerned.‚Äù

Publicly available information about the investigation was scarce at the time ‚Äî so McGurn, also a former U.S. military spy, began an investigation of his own. He had a brief phone conversation with Richardson, who seemed ‚Äúunder a lot of pressure,‚Äù he said. (Richardson also told him that ‚Äúegregious‚Äù wasn‚Äôt his word.) He spoke to faculty members who were nervous and exhausted.

McGurn brought the issue to the president in a letter. ‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù he wrote in the first sentence.

The letter was one of a half-dozen McGurn sent over the next three months that urged Sasse to put an end to the investigation and apologize to the ‚ÄúGainesville 6.‚Äù In another letter, McGurn asked Sasse to clarify a list of ‚Äúrumors,‚Äù including that ‚Äúif you criticize, you are ostracized,‚Äù and that his administration was a ‚Äúblack hole.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Emperor Has No Clothes,‚Äù he told the president. ‚ÄúWho can U trust to tell the truth?‚Äù

Sasse ignored all of the donor‚Äôs messages, and the university went into ‚Äúsilent mode‚Äù on the investigation, McGurn told¬†*The Chronicle*. At an April foundation meeting, McGurn stood at the exit, extended his hand, and ‚Äúsoftly‚Äù told Sasse that ‚Äúit needs to go away.‚Äù Sasse shook his hand but ‚Äúdid not respond otherwise.‚Äù

On May 6, McGurn made a final plea to both Sasse and Richardson. ‚ÄúThese are good people,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThey do not deserve this. UF does not need this. Please make it go away.‚Äù

Richardson quit the next day. His five-sentence resignation letter gave no rationale for the decision. Less than three weeks later, the university notified the six targeted liberal-arts faculty, also without explanation, that the investigation was ‚Äúnot moving forward.‚Äù

Roberts, the faculty union‚Äôs grievance-council chair, said McGurn‚Äôs intervention was a decisive factor in both decisions. ‚ÄúThe university thumbs its nose at the union,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOnce major donors get involved, they sit up and listen.‚Äù

The university later said that no personnel action was taken against the faculty, and documents from the investigation will not be considered in their future performance evaluations, including post-tenure reviews.

Some think they are still owed an apology, but ‚Äúthe university would rather do anything than apologize,‚Äù Roberts said. The six faculty have ‚Äúincredible loyalty toward the university, and they just dumped on them.‚Äù

The investigation‚Äôs closure cooled the feud between the units, but tensions still simmer.

The Faculty Senate‚Äôs former chair, Danaya Wright, said she tried her ‚Äúdamn best‚Äù to take the Hamilton Center‚Äôs concerns seriously. She created¬†[a task force](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25262636-copy-of-curricular-review-working-group-report-final?responsive=1&title=1)¬†to examine possible ‚Äúpolitical and structural headwinds‚Äù and invited center officials to participate, noting that ‚Äúthe issues plaguing the Hamilton Center are structural issues that go back for more than a decade.‚Äù

Inboden rejected the offer. The invitation‚Äôs ‚Äútendentious and distorted language‚Äù implied the center was ‚Äúsomehow at fault for the hostility and opposition we have faced,‚Äù he told Wright in an email. ‚ÄúI conclude with genuine sadness that the Faculty Senate would appear to be indulging in such parochialism.‚Äù

Wright said she also scrambled to advance the Hamilton Center‚Äôs degree proposals, fearing possible blowback if she didn‚Äôt. Faculty members typically take a month to review such proposals, and the end of the academic year was fast approaching, she told¬†*The Chronicle*. But she said the Faculty Senate didn‚Äôt receive the documents until a week before its May meeting, the last one of the academic year. Faculty members ran out of time and voted to table the degree proposals without discussion, effectively punting the decision until the fall.

In the robing room of a graduation ceremony held days later, Sasse told Wright that the Faculty Senate had ‚Äúlost his respect‚Äù and ‚Äúshould not exist,‚Äù Wright said, and refused to speak with her for the remainder of the event. (Sasse didn‚Äôt respond to an emailed question about the interaction.)

‚ÄúHe was childish,‚Äù Wright told¬†*The Chronicle*.

The Faculty Senate was forced to vote on the center‚Äôs degree proposals in a first-of-its-kind special summer meeting, called by Wright‚Äôs newly seated successor to discuss campus safety. Around that time, the faculty union issued a letter alleging that the last-minute gathering had been called ‚Äúpresumably to enable‚Äù the Hamilton Center to meet approval deadlines. In response, one of the center‚Äôs associate directors told the union president that ‚Äúwith absolute certainty,‚Äù he and his colleagues wanted to sever ties with the union because of its ‚Äúactive campaign against the Hamilton Center.‚Äù

Less than half of the Faculty Senate‚Äôs body participated in the Zoom meeting, due in part to issues with the electronic voting system. Senators ultimately approved the proposals, putting the majors back on track for their planned launch. The state university system‚Äôs Board of Governors gave final approval to both of the majors in October.

Inboden told¬†*The Chronicle*¬†that the center ‚Äúscrupulously adhered to every requirement and step in UF‚Äôs rigorous process‚Äù in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúLast year‚Äôs growth included some growing pains,‚Äù Inboden said. ‚ÄúThose are in the past.‚Äù

Mary Watt, the interim liberal-arts dean, said the college is ‚Äúproud to be partners‚Äù with the Hamilton Center.

‚ÄúWe enjoy an excellent working relationship,‚Äù she said in an emailed statement.

The center plans to offer three more majors beginning in 2026. A state-backed $40-million renovation of UF‚Äôs historical infirmary building into the Hamilton College is underway. This fall, the center offers 19 general-education courses and has amassed a flotilla of more than 30 humanities faculty members and Ivy League scholars ‚Äî including Sasse.

The president abruptly stepped down in July, citing a need to spend more time with his family after his wife‚Äôs recent epilepsy diagnosis. He‚Äôs teaching a new course, ‚ÄúCivil Discourse and the American Political Order,‚Äù at the center next spring. Before resigning from his post, he negotiated an addendum to his employment contract to¬†[keep his $1 million salary through 2028](https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2024/08/26/sasse-keep-1-million-salary-uf-until-2028/)¬†‚Äî making Sasse among the highest-paid professors in UF‚Äôs history.

He is now embroiled in a scandal after¬†[*The Independent Florida Alligator*](https://www.alligator.org/article/2024/08/sasse-s-spending-spree-former-uf-president-channeled-millions-to-gop-allies-secretive-contracts)*,*¬†UF‚Äôs student newspaper, reported that he tripled his office‚Äôs spending to award contracts to boutique consulting firms and high-paid, remote positions to his former Senate staff. Amid bipartisan calls for an audit, Sasse issued a¬†[1,744-word defense](https://x.com/BenSasse/status/1824475441933193386)¬†on X. He touted the Hamilton Center as the ‚Äúfirstfruit‚Äù of his presidency and as evidence that big spending was necessary for his administration‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Äògo bigger‚Äô approach.‚Äù

The center is ‚Äúwell on its way to making UF the top Western Civilization program in the nation ‚Äî and we will ground our students in the foundations of the Great Books and the American political order,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúParents: you should send your kids here.‚Äù

Tucked in the middle of Sasse‚Äôs monograph was a reprised rebuke of pedagogical orthodoxy among ‚Äúhumanities professors with nichified interests‚Äù who ‚Äúare allowed to drive demand unscrutinized into their narrow silos.‚Äù

Sasse‚Äôs parting message stirred Sensbach, now on temporary leave after finishing his three-year term as history chair. The former president, he said, was ‚Äúan unabashed champion of the Hamilton Center at the expense of everybody else.‚Äù

Sasse ‚Äúnever missed an opportunity to denigrate other departments and dismiss the seriousness of their scholarship,‚Äù Sensbach said. ‚ÄúHe hadn‚Äôt been on the campus five minutes before he started accusing us of indoctrinating students and being ‚Äònichified‚Äô and instructing us how to teach. ‚Ä¶We didn‚Äôt need that lecturing.‚Äù

With Sasse out of leadership, Sensbach hopes to return next spring to a liberal-arts college that can ‚Äúcoexist with the Hamilton Center amicably.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we can reach an understanding that that‚Äôs the case without his loud trumpeting of his belief that nobody else was worth a hill of beans at the University of Florida,‚Äù Sensbach said. ‚ÄúWe can talk together and have a good collaboration ‚Äî that to me is what it should be about, rather than pitting one side against the other as Sasse seemed to be doing.‚Äù"

- If they want to change rooms or res halls or move from off to on campus, they'll get an appt on 11/8 for a room reservation time 11/13-11/15.
- From 11/16-12/31, any current UF student can select a space, change rooms, or cancel their agreement w/out financial penalty.
- As of 1/1/25, cancellation fee enforced. Current students who wait until now to decide to live on campus will go on a waitlist.


Honors Village for Current Students:
- There are currently 952 honors students living in HV (~1400 beds), so non-honors students will get to continue living there - with some caveats.
- Unless they are staying in their exact same room, non-honors students will not be able to select an HV suite at this time. They can select a traditional room in Building 2.
- Honors students will be prioritized for Buildings 1, 3, and 4, plus the suites in Building 2.
- If your student is at all considering living in HV next year, I highly recommend submitting the agreement by 11/5. They can always change rooms or cancel before 1/1/25.


Honors Village for Incoming Students:
- Incoming honors students are guaranteed a bed in HV, provided they have submitted their housing agreement by 5/1/25. If they submit their agreement later, they will be on a waitlist for any remaining space on campus.
- There is no cost to submit a housing agreement, but there is a $225 cancellation fee.
- Incoming honors students will be routed to traditional rooms and will only get suites if there are spaces remaining from current honors student selection.
- Honors students are not required to live in HV. They will need an honors roommate if they want first pick at a room in HV.
- Remaining beds may go to preferred roommates who are non-honors, followed by any non-honors student. Honors students are not guaranteed to get the option to bring in a non-honors roommate, as it will be space-available.


Note, there will always be exceptions for housing accommodations, as available rooms that meet those needs are limited across campus.

And as always, specific questions about Housing agreements, policies, etc. should go directly to Housing.

Hope that helps!"""

The thing is, I initially signed cuz they were advertised as a utility included in rent place according to all the reviews, and it was for the first year, but they unchecked the electricity among the provided utilities so now in the second year we're having to pay for electricity on top of the rent which increased since last year. 

The thing is, is this normal? I was just wondering if other places do this where they seem to include everything on the first year but they start taking things off, or if this is the first time they ever took the electricity off of the utility being provided within the package and I just got unlucky. 

Googling around all these other places ppl have been saying that they include all utilities with the rent but now I'm not sure anymore. 

Are there other places you guys would recommend that has been including utilities with rent for multiple years without any changes? I really don't wanna have to move every year....."

I did fine in calc 1 online, and i actually really enjoyed it online cause it was relatively lax with streese and he was very accomodating. Also, I had the opportunity to just sit in on the in-person lectures and follow along, even though online had a different pacing, so i had the best of both worlds.  
Calc 2, however, cooked me. The online portion felt much harder than the irl section, and the tutors and peer mentors I talked to seemed to agree. Also, no partial credit, so I was consistently getting mid grades on things for silly mistakes. I enjoyed having some freedom with the online section, but it was less forgiving than with Streese. Chui was great though, and i still sat in on her lectures and office hours, where she was loads of support.

I'm wondering now whats the plan for calc 3? I've never had in-person discussion quizzes and the likes, so i'm real nervous. I'm the type to choke on exams and quizzes, especially in person, so i'm unsure whats the move. Can someone give some insight on the class?

I am so mad at myself. so last night I decided to go out to blow off some energy after being sick for a few days. also because it's Halloween and who the fuck stays in on Halloween. water polo party was shit, they ran out of alcohol super quick and the music was mostly mid, but when I was just about to leave, I ran into this guy dressed as Luffy and this girl in a leopard print top who complimented my costume (tanjiro). we got to talking, decided we liked each other, and agreed to go to this other party together, and as we were leaving, we started chatting with these two girls who were headed to the same place we were (I'm pretty sure they also had a third friend but she was going straight home). one's costume i genuinely couldn't tell what it was and kept forgetting to ask, the other looked like a dark angel sort of vibe but had a ladybug pendant on (we talked about her costume but now I don't remember what she said, love memory loss)

we got to the second party and it was a much smaller event but the drinks were stronger and the music was way better and they had cake, so we hung out there until things started to die down. at some point in the night we were all sitting lined up on the curb smoking together and it was such a good vibe. after we left there we still didn't really want to go home so we decided to wander around campus, get snacks from a vending machine, and so on. we ended up by the Reitz pond (disclaimer: no breaking and entering was committed), where we stayed for at least an hour, maybe 2, but at this point I very much lost track of time. ladybug girl and I were talking separate from the other three, made out a bit, the usual

after dropping leopard print girl off at her apartment the 4 survivors (me, Luffy, ladybug girl, and her friend) ended up at ladybug girl's apartment where we spent the night. when we all parted ways in the morning I was so out of it that I didn't get anyone's contact info but I don't want to never hear from/see them again so now I'm hoping I can find them somehow

**tldr:** met some cool people last night. didn't get their contact info/socials. now very mad at myself about it.

if you are one of the people I hung out with or know who I'm talking about, hi! it's tanjiro, dm me bc you were pretty cool and I want to be friends"

Intermediate Econ doable with other heavy courses?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/1ghcbft/intermediate_econ_doable_with_other_heavy_courses/,2,0,2024-11-01 18:28:21,"I'm an econ and computer science double major. For spring semester, I'll be taking Data Structures and Algorithms as well as Calculus 3. I'm intending to take another econ class and also maybe a gen-ed. The gen-ed will be easy, hopefully, so I'm wondering if I should take intermediate econ.  
DSA and Calc 3 are critical and non-negotiable for my schedule. I'll be able to have some help from friends in those courses, so it hopefully won't be too bad, but I'm unsure if intermediate econ will bite off more than i can chew.   
For context, I took macro and micro this past summer, and I got cooked by it. Partially because it was in the summer alongside physics 1 and lab (loaded schedule!) and partially cause I suck at exam-heavy classes. However, it's important I keep these in mind. DSA is also a work-heavy schedule, and I'm not exactly the word's strongest coder.

However, fall sem of 2025 I'll be taking operating systems, intro to software engineering, and japanese. So, not sure if later is better. 

Any insight? Thanks a bunch!"

He constantly plays video games and hasn't been seen doing homework or going to class once. When my friend tries to study the roomate is incredibly loud, yelling and screaming at his games. The floor under the roomate has become so dirty that it's black in color and when my friend asked him to take out the trash he stopped throwing his food away and keeps the empty containers by his desk so he doesn't have to leave. The room smells awful because of this (so bad that the people in the hall have complained). My friend has tried addressing this but the roomate just says ""yeah okay"" and doesn't fix anything. I mean the guy hasn't showered or gone to class in weeks, every time i see him he is wearing the same clothes, it's super gross. So I'm wondering is there any way my friend can get rid of him?

My academic path has been unique, so here‚Äôs the background: I graduated high school early, expecting it would give me a head start, but I didn‚Äôt have enough SAT prep and ended up applying to UCF three days before their deadline. With a low SAT score, I wasn‚Äôt accepted, so I stayed at my dual-enrollment Florida State College to finish my AA degree. The first semesters were challenging due to undiagnosed ADHD and anxiety, which affected my performance and led me to fail some classes. After finally getting professional help, I retook those classes and earned A's, and I‚Äôm now completing the prerequisites for the Health Sciences major. Recently, I was accepted into my college‚Äôs new Honors program, which I applied for after hearing about the new pilot program which has been encouraging.Here‚Äôs where things get complicated: I‚Äôve managed to keep an upward trend with my GPA, but my final GPA here is projected at around 3.4-3.5, while my UF GPA will likely be closer to 3.0-3.1 due to earlier grades. Health Sciences is my goal, but completing its prerequisites is risky because, if I don‚Äôt get in, I‚Äôll have spent nearly two semesters on courses that don‚Äôt meet prerequisites for other similar majors. Experience-wise, I‚Äôm a certified EMT with over 1,500 hours from various paid jobs, two years volunteering at my local hospital, and around 50 hours shadowing physicians, with more on the way. I am already 18 turning 19 soon  I will be nearly 20 by the time I finish the first semesters at UF if I even get in should I just consider applying back to UCF and graduating next semester?

My main questions are: could my recent improvement and hands-on experience still make me a strong candidate for Health Sciences, despite the GPA( which I don't meet the minimum requirement for) , or would a different major be more realistic? And if I should change majors, any suggestions on similar fields with overlapping prerequisites?

My roommate isn‚Äôt spared either. We‚Äôre both restless. I would file a noise complaint but I don‚Äôt know where the noise is even coming from because of the lack of soundproofing.

I just cant anymore. To any prospective UF student, if you are taking a major that requires any obligation at all, STEM, whatever, get off campus. Do not stay at the dorms.

Not sure about housing next year,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/1gfpz9v/not_sure_about_housing_next_year/,1,4,2024-10-30 15:58:49,"So it's my first year at UF, and I currently live on campus. It's not too bad, I like the proximity to classes and being on campus at night when I want to just walk around or go study at the libraries, it feels safe, the social aspect can be good or bad. The cons are that it can be loud, sometimes the communal areas worsen my social anxiety, the room is very small, and the bathrooms and kitchen aren't always the cleanest. 

Housing wants us to renew for on campus next year by next week. I don't think I want to live on campus again next year. I'd really like to share an apartment with my boyfriend. However, we both don't have jobs (he's planning on getting one soon). I would be using some bright futures money for rent and paying for the rest out of pocket. We would like to find a place that's decently close to campus or at least has good bus routes, 1bd preferably, less than $1200 a month, safe, doesn't have to be updated or new looking whatsoever. 

We've been looking around at some apartments like Colony 33, Campus Point Condominiums, Tumblin Creek, College Manor, they all seem to be pretty good and within our price range. I just hope it's feasible."

Where do UF students stand on what's being said in the media?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/1gfvk9s/where_do_uf_students_stand_on_whats_being_said_in/,0,1,2024-10-30 19:51:49,"Hey everyone! I (20F) am currently a third-year undergraduate psychology student. This semester I'm taking a senior level class called Multicultural Psychology, where we dive into different cultures' mental health approaches and decolonizing our Eurocentric approach when it comes to counseling. It's a very new sector of psychology and not very prominent, but I've learned a lot about how CBT and other traditional approaches can be harmful to POC, which is interesting to see as a biracial (black and Asian) POC.

(Warning: Politics. This isn't meant to attack anyone in this group as I'm only discussing Political figures and the people endorsing them. I just want a discussion with people in college to see if my mindset on this is as uncommon as it feels.) As the election is coming up, there has been more news coverage on the candidates and the people supporting them. One of the first questions asked in my class was ""do politics belong in psychology?"" to which I raised my hand and answered yes. I further explained how mental health policies and the use of psychology/medicine in political campaigns and legislature makes it a necessary topic of discussion. It's something we briefly discuss in our class, but we're aware that our viewpoints on what's going on politically is a part of a small group in our state.

The reason I bring all of this up is because I wanted to have a discussion on the political climate and possible ramifications for all of the hate speech and push for Eurocentric assimilation that has been said recently regarding many different races, ethnicities, and genders. In multicultural psychology, we have discussed liberation psychology, an approach that aims to understand and address oppression by challenging traditional Western psychology. From what I've seen, a lot of spokespeople on the republican's side have been very dismissive of this (against addressing oppression/racism, as seen by being against critical race theory) and the different cultures (ex. blatantly mislabeling Kamala Harris because she's biracial, saying racist things Haitians, calling Puerto Rico an island of trash) in this country, and it's going to have a lot of negative effects generationally that those people will never see or hear about. As someone who wants to help treat people for mental health problems, as well as other fields in medicine as a Physician's assistant, I just feel like their ignorance is spreading hate that they'll never understand/feel. I just want to know how others feel about this in terms of the psychology/medicine field and where our student body stands. Thank you!"

So, right now I'm a psychology major (which I might change or if anything I might get a minor or double major, not totally sure yet), and I'm in Bio 1 (BSC2010) and Pre-Calc Algebra (MAC1140). I did well on the first two exams for both classes, but content just gets harder as the year goes on, and my next 2 exams for both classes are coming up next week.

I've been studying for a while, and I feel okay-ish about both (honestly the Genetics unit for Bio 1 is apparently the worst test so who even knows), but I'm just worried about the future; both of those classes are considered critical tracking for my major, and I'm worried if I perform too poorly on these exams that I will not be able to make a comeback (for math especially since I've looked over the material for the following exam and wow).

I've already scheduled a tutoring session to help me with math, and for biology I just hope I can study well enough again. Do you guys think I'll be okay? I'm genuinely terrified of doing poorly, cause in my mind getting a bad grade just leads to a downward spiral..."

How to vote on amendment 4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/1gby9dh/how_to_vote_on_amendment_4/,350,372,2024-10-25 16:23:33,"I‚Äôll make this short, but between the canvasers on campus and the very opinionated words on the ballot, I thought I‚Äôd set the record straight.

The amendment is not about whether or not you agree with abortions. You might dislike abortions, you might share that opinion with friends and family, but do you believe you have the right to decide what other people do? If your opinion is based on your faith, as it often is with this issue, do you think you have the right to right to enforce a faith based opinion on people who do not believe the same things as you?

And in terms of the wording on the ballot, Desantis wrote in how codifying abortion would lead to a drop in birth rates. However, everyone getting an abortion fundamentally does not feel ready to be a parent. What are the consequences of this? It‚Äôs detailed in the book ‚ÄúFreakonomics‚Äù how there‚Äôs a strong statistical correlation between the legalization of abortion in New York and a steep decline in crime rates 17 years after. 

So even if it drops birth rates (which there is no evidence of), it would only stop people who are not well equipped to become a parent from having kids who would then grow up in a home they don‚Äôt deserve.

So all in all, if you are thinking about voting no on 4, I implore you to think about whether or not you think you have the right to enforce your opinion on others who disagree or even don‚Äôt believe the same things you do. And whether or not you are willing to accept the consequences of that action."

I am a student currently studying in Belgium. The school I attend has a very different system from the one in the US, where a good grade is much lower here than in the US. (Ex: a 14/20 which equivalates to a 70% is a pretty good grade here when it is a ""meh"" grade in the US). Being well aware of that fact, I took the ACT and scored a 34 composite. I am still scared that my GPA could be a limiting factor. Another precaution I took was explain my situation in my common app application.

So I'm wondering whether or not that might be a real issue.

I don't have the exact number for my GPA but if I had to make a number it would be around 70% so I think that would translate to a 2.0"

NEED Advice !!!! about potentially trying to medically withdraw from Orgo 2 ,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/1gbfsfo/need_advice_about_potentially_trying_to_medically/,0,13,2024-10-24 22:55:21,"Essentially, this semester has gone horribly for me, I had a family member pass at the beginning of the semester which put me off to an awful start, and with back-to-back hurricanes happening, it did not help me with Orgo 2 in the slightest. On top of all this, my grandma recently was put in intensive care.  And all of this has contributed to me failing Orgo 2 and I have to drop it. I'm doing ok enough in my other classes where I can thug it out. But Orgo 2 is cooked for me. I'm wondering about anyone's experience with petitioning for medical withdrawal, and if it is even worth it for me to attempt it. I say this because the death was not an immediate family (still personally close family nonetheless). 

IDK, Ik I sound like a little bitch making all these excuses and Ik everyone goes through stuff, but man this has been mentally tough, so I'm politely asking for advice. I have bright futures, so having to pay outta pocket for the class once I drop the class is gonna suck ass."

So, I'm interested in transferring next fall from another in-state college and I'm torn between schools. Majoring in psych (for clinical psychology) with a double major in English (most interested in creative writing and the study of literature) but not sure what to make of these departments from the outside. Feels like all I ever hear about are the business/engineering schools, lol. Any insights?"
UF NURSING GPA ,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/1g9rfb6/uf_nursing_gpa/,2,1,2024-10-22 19:56:41,"I got a bunch of dual enrollment credits from the community college in high school, and unfortunately, I did not do well in some of them. It shows in ONEUF that my GPA from that institution is only 3.37. I'm afraid that my GPA won't be high enough for applying to the TBSN program next year. Should I retake some classes here at UF?"
