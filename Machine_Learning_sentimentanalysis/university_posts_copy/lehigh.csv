I want to enter the school of engineering. My weighted GPA is 4.3 and my school doesn't have an unweighted GPA. My Ecas is okayish (100+ community service hours, coding camps, club president, organized STEM olympiad, head of the student council, 1 internship, and 5 honors). I am an international student with an EFC of 9k annually. I have 9A\* in my GCSEs and 5A's in my As Level with 5A\* predicted in A levels. However, I have a 1400 SAT that is why I am thinking of going test-optional, I am also thinking of taking the December SAT but its registration deadline is tomorrow and I am confused on what to do, my mid terms of high school are on the same dates and I don't know what to prioritise: Mid terms or SAT, as mid-term results would also be submitted to colleges."

Should I ED 2 to Lehigh?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lehigh/comments/1gnragm/should_i_ed_2_to_lehigh/,1,1,2024-11-10 03:14:19,"Hello! I am a senior in high school (soon-to-be graduate) and am highly considering Lehigh for my Early Decision II. The reason I did not ED I anywhere is because I was unsure of whether or not I was ready to commit to a school that early. I recently visited the campus (it was beautiful) but I have a few concerns...

1. Social Scene - I am not a heavy partier (although I do not mind it) and I hear a lot of people say that Greek Life dominates the social scene at Lehigh. I do not plan to be a part of Greek Life, but I am concerned that there will not be a lot of ways to meet people/activities to do outside of Greek Life. Somebody I know said that they felt like they *needed* to join a frat because that was the only thing to do there, and he did not enjoy it that much.

2. Location - I do not live far from Lehigh, but I have heard some not-so-great things about the area around campus. I drove through it on the way there, obviously, but I did not think it was too horrible (or at least that was my first impression). I hear people say all the time that the campus is beautiful, but anything outside of it is run-down, empty, and eerie. I am unsure how much the outside-of-campus area matters because I have heard that most of the time you are spending on campus anyways, but I am interested to know how the area actually is.

3. Area of Study - I am a Biochemistry major, and am unsure whether or not I want to take the med-school path or do more research/lab work. I have read that Lehigh has great science programs, but I do not know if science is one of their main focuses (as I would want there to be at least a # of paths for me to follow). If there is anyone also studying Biology/Another science I would love to know your experiences.

I still have time to think through either committing ED II or RD (although I probably would not be accepted RD), so that is what is making this decision difficult. Thanks for the help. "

I’m in my sophomore year, going to Rutgers NB and my family moved while I was staying on campus during my freshman year. Some plans fell through and now I have a balance of $9K. (Taking out loans, and not really important to the story). The issues is that they moved us to PA.  And if I take the train/ bus is going to be 2hr and 30 minutes. The problem is that that bus only runs on Tuesday and 5:30 at night, so that’s a no. And the only other way is to take an Uber which is $80 one way; unless I go with my mother when she picks my sister up from work (around 8 am) and get back home when she feels like it or she drops my sister at work (9:30 pm). While I’m commuting I can possible get a refund check or just use my work study money to fund the Uber trips. My only hope is that I get an RA position and just go home every 2 or 3 weeks for a break from college. 
 

However I was looking at other colleges near by me where I noticed Lehigh university. Lehigh is only 45 minutes by bus, but I applied here before and I got rejected. And if I transfer here my Financial Aid might be less and I might end up paying more.

Because of this, I wasn’t able to get my ideal schedule plan, which was:

- MATH 022
- ENGR 005
- ECO 001
- PHY 011, 012
- JOUR 001

Now, I have created a schedule containing:

- PHIL 001
- JOUR 001
- MATH 022
- CHM 030
- ECO 001

I am more worried about this schedule because it uses up 5 out of the 6 of my free elective credits on PHIL 001 and JOUR 001. However, there aren’t too many other options that fit, especially since most of the physics seats are taken up.

Is this new schedule acceptable for a freshman computer science major? Or should I try to work something else out?"

How a single Reddit post exposed a student at elite college as a fraud who lied his way into the school,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lehigh/comments/1dpw3pz/how_a_single_reddit_post_exposed_a_student_at/,332,99,2024-06-27 16:54:07,"A single Reddit post [exposed a student](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13573139/amp/How-single-Reddit-post-exposed-student-elite-college-fraud-lied-way-school.html) at an elite college as a fraud who lied his way into the school - and had major legal consequences.

Aryan Anand, 19, a former student at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, was exposed as a total fraud after [a Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/s/4ZXrbn4x8V) revealed his web of lies.

Earlier this month, Anand pleaded guilty to forgery in Northampton County following revelations that his entire application to the university was fabricated. 

The international student was caught after investigators found a post written by an anonymous user they believed to be Anand on the Reddit forum titled, 'I have built my life and career on lies.' 

The post recounted how he created fraudulent admission application and financial aid paperwork to get into Lehigh, which has an acceptance rate of 37 percent and tuition of nearly $60,000 per year. 

The school was notified by a Reddit moderator and an investigation by university police took place.

The post reportedly did not mention the name of the school but the moderator allegedly made the right guess after seeing that Anand followed Lehigh on the website.  

'The defendant only had one other university that he followed, which was Lehigh University. So, the moderator actually reached out to Lehigh to give them a heads up,' Northampton County Assistant D.A. Michael Weinert told ABC 6. 

Investigators found that Anand had in fact impersonated a school principal and created falsified documents, including phony school transcripts, tax statements and a death certificate for his father, who is in fact alive and well, living in India.

'It was difficult to really verify these things. I think that was great work by Lehigh and their police force. They were able to really dig deep and find all this really was false,' Weinert added. 

Anand was arrested in April and charged with multiple offenses including forgery, tampering with records, theft by deception, and theft of services.

On June 12, he pleaded guilty to one count of forgery, classified as a second-degree felony.

Anand initially faced 10 to 20 years in prison, however, at the request of the university his penalty was reduced to expulsion from the school and deportation to India.

As part of the agreement for his return to India, the university waived the request for restitution, estimated at approximately $85,000.

Anand was subsequently handed over to the custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Lehigh University responded in a statement, saying it 'appreciates the report to its ethics hotline and the diligent investigation by the Lehigh University Police Department that led to Aryan Anand's arrest.'

math 032?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lehigh/comments/1dpendo/math_032/,2,5,2024-06-27 00:56:43,"Hello, I'm an incoming freshman, and I'd like to know how difficult Math 032 is and if there is any benefit to taking it over Math 022. I took dual credit calculus in highscool (realistically it was taught like ap ab my school thought it would give more students credit as you can take the ap exam anyway) I also I got a 6 in IB math AI but my teacher was very keen on proofs and conceptual understanding so I'm somewhat comfortable. I am considering majoring in either MSE or ChmE but want to minor in applied math, so taking the more challenging course might be interesting. However, I am slightly worried about tanking my GPA off the bat and If the preparation the course would give me would be worth it to push through so I do better in math courses later on in my minor. any thoughts about this or math at lehigh in general would be appreciated.

edit: honestly thinking about wondering if I would tank my gpa in math022 as well so thoughts on that would also be helpful"

Since I turned 18, I was auto booted from my family plan and been uninsured. Now I don't typically get sick nor have any emergencies, but I also understand that by being uninsured the price of seeking health care is very costly, so I'm gonna need a plan. Moreso for physical checkups, eyeglasses, and dental.

That being said:

Is the plan (for a fricking whopping $2.5k) worth it?

What is and isn't covered in Lehigh University health plan?

From what I’ve research, ED chances for these schools significantly increase from RD. I’m not relying on that because they are all good schools but it would be a dream to go to tulane. I am pretty confident that I could get into Lehigh ED based on what other people have said. My dad went to Bucknell, (if that helps) but I don’t think I would get in even if I ED. I visited tulane and loved it and I know that they are all about binding and showing interest in the school, but I think with such a low gpa it wouldn’t make sense for me to get in. 😣 Do they really accept 68% of ED applicants?

Question about Health Insurance from Lehigh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lehigh/comments/1di82tb/question_about_health_insurance_from_lehigh/,2,3,2024-06-17 20:27:44,"I got an email saying I must either enroll or waive from Lehigh health insurance. The cost of insurance is $2509.  
 So, my first question is, is the cost of health insurance included in the total tuition cost, or is it considered a separate cost? I already have my full tuition covered by Lehigh, so if I choose to enroll, do I have to pay separately for the insurance? No cost for insurance was mentioned separately in the financial aid worksheet that I got from Lehigh upon admittance.

My second question is that I already qualify for free insurance from NYC, but I don't think it covers in Pennsylvania. In that case, can I waive the Lehigh health insurance? I'm perfectly okay to go to doctors and stuff in NYC. I couldn't find clear info on the website; all it says is that my current insurance must have ""comparable coverage"" to the insurance plan Lehigh is offering.

Lehigh University is 12 minutes away from work, and I would love to take this opportunity to experience Lehigh as a visiting student. The Summer II session lines up with my internship period almost too well.

It looks like both housing and a 9-meal dining plan would run me $1050+$815=$1865 which sounds like great value.

I'm excited to meet new people and make new friends there which makes me inclined to house and dine on-campus but what do the students here think is best? Should I consider off-campus housing?

What should I know about the best hangout spots, activities, and places to visit at Lehigh University and in Bethlehem to make the most of my time there?

I'm a very sociable person, I love meeting new people and making new friends so I would greatly appreciate any tips and suggestions on how I can best do this and connect with others. (Social gatherings, campus clubs/activities, Discord servers, etc.)

I have not decided which course to take yet. None of my remaining graduation requirements are offered during the summers at Lehigh.

I will probably consider a less rigorous and more fun pass/fail course that may not be transferrable for the sake of meeting housing and dining eligibility. I'd prefer in-person classes to fully experience life as a student there. Any course recommendations?

ED Lehigh as an international student?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lehigh/comments/1d11otb/ed_lehigh_as_an_international_student/,1,4,2024-05-26 13:44:39,"I was thinking of my ED School and Lehigh has topped my list so far. I absolutely love the school, the brown and white color, the environment, iconic libraries and everything. and, I think, at a place like lehigh I'll actually be able to make good friends rather than on a highly stresfull environment of schools like MIT or Caltech. 

  
So, Price is my only concern. Is it possible to get a full ride as an international student? My parents annual income is less than 15k and I come from lower middle class. so, price is definitely a factor to me. 

  
My stats: 

  
1530 SAT, 4.0/4.0 GPA, Rank #1/99, Leadership \[House Captain (6th to 10th grade), Club President (12), Scout Troop Leader (9,10)\], Multiple regional and national hackathons gold medal, National Chem Olympiad Gold, National informatic Olympiad Rank top 10 all nation, Some community service, part of a startup but I'm more of an employee, We're going live next month. 

A paper on how we can use machine learning to detect microplastics to combat pollutions. Worked with professors, however, did the machine learning part 100% by myself. so, was quite challenging. 

And I'm thinking of starting a non-profit with some of my friends and so some more community service.

  
This is all I have. I'd love to hear your thoughts. And Lehigh takes 1-2 students from my country every year. 

  
Thanks in advance!!!"

also what was the leading factor in your commitment and what makes you change your mind sometimes?

lehigh is one of my top choices right now because for my second choice i didn’t quite enjoy my stay there as much, it was fun and i met a lot of new people but i didn’t know if it was the best fit for me. my second choice is cheaper by 2-3k i believe which isn’t that bad of a difference for me. i was offered an amazing amount of aid, but im still going to have to pay off loans which is another factor im considering. i didn’t get as much aid for my in state schools though. i also didn’t get to visit lehigh for as long as my second choice which is why im still indecisive about it. i really enjoyed how lehigh wasn’t forceful upon a major and encouraged exploration, which i hope they stay true to! i wanted to go to college to work in the medical field but now im leaning towards healthcare business.

Lehigh vs Montana State University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lehigh/comments/1cjmgma/lehigh_vs_montana_state_university/,3,14,2024-05-03 23:35:00," This is my friend who wrote this btw who did two deposit enrollments so he still has time to decide.

I was accepted into Lehigh University and Montana State University. Here are my general, relatively scattered thoughts of both. Please feel free to comment if you have helpful advice or a different perspective.

At Montana State, I was awarded a Provost Scholarship, which would decrease my cost of attendance to $16,000 per year. I would graduate debt free and would be able to partially fund graduate school with leftover 529 funds. I would also be able to get my private pilot's license, which is something that I have always wanted to do. I don't really like Montana State's buildings that much, but the surrounding mountains and environment are quite incredible. Because of my 60 or so credits from AP tests, I could take classes that I want to take, and thus pursue whatever I find to enjoy. I think I want to do engineering, but I am not entirely sure, and so having the credits for lateral exploration would greatly benefit me. I also would major in economics, whereas Lehigh’s IBE is more business focused. If I get my MBA, then I think it would be better to have an economics background because then I would have the best of both worlds instead of just a high concentration of one. I enjoy skiing/fishing, but I also want to surround myself with students who will intellectually challenge me.

At Lehigh, I got into the Integrated Business and Engineering (IBE) program, which-as of right now-is pretty much my dream pursuit. However, Lehigh would leave me around $80,000 in debt, and as I mentioned before I intend to pursue grad school. IBE students make roughly $30,000 more upon graduation than Montana graduates, so that could possibly outweigh the risk of taking on debt. I really liked Lehigh's libraries and I fully intend to spend many a night there. There is not as much to do outside Lehigh, but I think that I would be so busy in IBE that I may not have time to explore, even though I know that finding balance between social/academic life is very important. Lehigh's IBE program is quite rigorous, and I would definitely not be able to have as many electives as I would at Montana, and so I may not be able to explore the curriculum as much. I also liked the general vibe from the students at Lehigh better.

I know that my entering position and willingness to work hard will make me a big fish in a big pond at either school. My plans may change, but I intend to pursue a JD/MBA program, and I would like to set myself up for the opportunity to do the degrees at the best possible graduate programs. If it helps, I will probably work for a few years after graduating from undergrad before I move on to higher education. Montana State and Lehigh do not really send that many students to top grad programs, and that concerns me-especially for Lehigh’s price. So what should I do? Where would I launch better to grad school? Does undergrad really matter? I know that my success will be determined by how I am able to create and find opportunity, and not by where I go to school. But I also want to go to a good school where I will be happy and build an excellent resume. Any advice would help, thank you!"

I applied to IBE thinking it would let me have a better chance at landing management positions in engineering jobs or keep a path to business open in case I wanted to pursue it, but it seems (from browsing this sub) that it's more for students looking for a Wall Street-esque job. 

Can I still use an IBE degree (w/ a Bachelor's in engineering) to find jobs as an engineer or would I be better off just geting an engineering degree? Would the IBE help me land better positions as an engineer or not really?

They’re about equal in terms of prestige and while McGill has more of the music i’m looking for, Lehigh has more interesting engineering clubs (what i’m going into). I haven’t gotten my financial offer back from McGill yet but chances are it will be cheaper, maybe significantly cheaper than Lehigh, but Lehigh offered me a spot in their 4+1 program for chemical engineering, so it would save me a year on grad school.

1. I've a work study of 2.5k. In order to earn my semester fees (6,900 per semester) I have to do wage jobs. My oiss councillor said, wage jobs are not guaranteed. So I'm very concerned about it. Can I do off campus/on campus job worth $12/13 dollar per hour beside work-study?
2. Is it possible to skip meal plan to reduce costs?
3. RA-ship positions are competitive. I will definitely apply for this position if I go to lehigh.
4. After these aforementioned reasons, should I join lehigh? Or should I go to UTA in texas where net cost is 8k(excluding living expenses)

**HS:** Top 10%, neither honors nor APs, ECs: active 2 clubs, second place in a solar-powered car competition (school level), volunteer at the district's event about public transportation.

**College:** 4.0/4.0 GPA, Dean's List. ECs: PTK member, participant at AMATYC's math competition.

(Courses taken: Calc 1 2, Chem 1, Intro to Statistics, Intro to Java, English Compo 1, Intro to Sociology, Engineering - Static, Computer-Aid Draft, Phys for Engr 1 (AP Physics C).

SAT: 1420

**Background:** First-gen student, working an average of 30 hrs / week while doing school.

**LoRs:** 6 in total. (1 from Calc 1 prof, 1 from Static prof (which is the strongest out of all), 2 from HS teachers,  2 from 2 supervisors at where I am working).

If anyone's wondering about my STATS, it is perfect 4.0 UW GPA (no AP/IB as my school doesn't have those), 1480 SAT, and I have 2 international, 3 national honors (and a bunch of regional/school honors that I added in Additional info); my ECs were mostly in Journalism and Film; as I write (paid) at my country's national daily, have established one small online news portal, have a paid job at an online news portal, have another voluntary (which will turn paid in near future) work in another educational media platform, did some summer programs in Journalism; then, I have some photography projects, a short documentary, some film scripts and some short stories and a published book; then, I have some other voluntary works (charity, teaching, helping US aspirants with information, mentoring (essay reviewing, college suggesting, and stuff) other US aspirants - who made it with full-tuition in Fall 24).

If I apply for Fall 25, I really think I will have more honors and more impact on the ECs I've been working with; do you think I should consider Fall 25? (won't retake the SAT for 1500+ though, can't spend another $100, I know it's not a lot to you, but to me, it is).

I didn't apply for Fall 22 though, because I actually grew interested in film/journalism in my senior year of high school (I was into STEM before my senior year), and I wanted to see this through. I wrote this for my gap year explanation as well. The Fall 23 essay was crap, the Fall 24 Early essay received mixed responses, and the regular essay received unanimous appreciation, so I was thinking I would use that essay again. Do you think there's any chance of getting a full-ride with my third gap year at any US college?"

I got my predicted score on late October 2023, and my actual results on January 2024. However, I am asking for a remarking for three subjects, so my official results can't be submitted yet. 

The problem is, I haven't specified this via email. So, my midterm report for the IB says ""Official scores will be available on January 2nd"", and my counselor has only submitted my predicted score. 

More than that, does Lehigh even review IB scores and consider them for the admission process?

Should you get a plan with more or less dining dollars?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lehigh/comments/19efw27/should_you_get_a_plan_with_more_or_less_dining/,2,10,2024-01-24 12:23:37,"Ive been looking into the meal plans Lehigh offers (as a freshman) and there are 3 available options:

1. 250 Meal swipes (prolly not gonna chose this coz i want some dining dollars)
2. 225 Meal swipes + 50 Dining dollars
3. 200 Meal swipes + 150 dining dollars

They all cost 3,270$ so cost doesnt matter. I am Vegetarian so I know I can always have a confirmed meal at Rathbone, but what places accept dining dollars? Is it worth having 150 of them? 

I know that if I take the 200 plan I can have 2 solid meals every day and still have 4 points left at the end of semester (14 weeks= 96 days) but then as a vegetarian would I actually have used up my dining dollars? Conversely with 225 plan, will I have too little dining dollars?

HS GPA: 3.8
College Gpa: 3.2(Maybe I could get this up to 3.3-3.4 after this semester however my schedule is a bit difficult.
In high school got waitlisted from Carnegie Mellon and Laf however I was accepted to Bucknell as far as similar colleges to Lehigh go.  
I didn't take the SAT or ACT
My ECs were pretty solid I was Varsity Captain, NHS, and a bunch of volunteer hours. 
It would also be important to point out that I have a unique story in that I grew up in a foreign Latin American country and moved here at a later age(I am a US citizen however.)  But I thought it would help that I am hispanic and also immigrated here at a later age.

- Class that I took freshman year: Chem 1, calc 1 2, static, physics 1, CAD (at my cc its called CAD, I have no idea what it would be equivalent to the one at LU), Elementary Stat, engl 1, sociology 1, CS elective (which I consider is not transferrable).

It’s in my top 2 schools along with Binghamton, and I really don’t know my chances at getting in. At least with Bing I can ball park it and say I have a decent shot at getting in ( you can never get too hopeful these days), but I just want someone’s true opinion on my shot at getting in.

For starters, I would be going for finance

Here are some of my credentials:

1370 SAT

98.1 WGPA (Graduating Summe) 

National honors society scholar 

Senior year VP of DECA and multi-year state qualifier for DECA

 VP of my YAF chapter

Treasure of a non profit Altruism 

Writing tutor/peer writing fellow 

Volunteer hours at religion schooling for kids 

Store cleric at a store for around a year and half 

Beach attendant at a beach club

Financial Literacy meetings with younger children 

Another thing that I really don’t know if it could help me get into Lehigh is that my cousin went there and graduated top of his class at the business school. We share the same last name, but idk if that legacy counts at all. 

I scheduled an interview with an alumni, hopefully just getting my name out there and I will send my current paper for my DECA competition this year to my admissions counselor, kind of demonstrating my abilities in the Business and Finance world.

I’m applying regular Bc I don’t really know if I wanna pay the huge price tags for Lehigh just yet, and they don’t have early action which SUCKS bc I so would apply EA.

last thing. For both Bing and lehigh, I’m gonna write probably an email or smth abt my desire to attend these schools, but idk if I’m doing too much to increase my odds.

SOMEONE GIVE ME THEIR HONEST TAKE ABOUT ME GETTING INTO LEHIGH."

Just wanted to share my experience with the Lehigh application process and see if anyone else is going through the same thing. I applied ED1, and it's been a bit of a rollercoaster.

So, I submitted everything, including my CSS and IELTS results. Fast forward two weeks, and nothing was showing up in the applicant portal. I sent a couple of emails, and they responded saying they're swamped with applications and still locating files. Fair enough, right?

But here's where it gets tricky. It's been three weeks now, and decisions are supposed to be out in early December. I'm starting to wonder if my application is even being looked at. The suspense is killing me!

And to top it off, I can't even access the Applicant Portal anymore. When I try to log in, it says my password is incorrect. When I hit the ""Forgot Password"" button, it gives me this message:

Error: The username you entered could not be found.

To make matters worse, Lehigh is my top choice, and I'm feeling pretty down about the whole situation. I applied last year too, and it's déjà vu.

I've emailed them again about the portal issue, but haven't heard back yet. Has anyone else faced similar problems or have any advice on what to do next? I'd really appreciate any insights or if someone from Lehigh's admissions team could shed some light on the situation.

Is Lehigh a cutthroat competitive school, or is it more friendly and collaborative?

How are the academics themselves, especially in engineering? Are they super rigorous, fairly challenging, or more relaxed? I want to go to college to *learn* (in this case, about how electricity and electronics work). I don’t want to spend the majority of my free time studying and doing homework; I want to learn in class, spend a couple hours on homework, and then have lots of free time to enjoy campus, socialize, and do things I enjoy.

3. Are some engineering students are put in a dorm together, some are in a dorm with the general university students? (website wasn't clear on that).
4. How big are your classes? (freshmen year, later?)

For starters, I would be going for finance and prob accounting (haven’t really figured out if I wanted to do both).

1370 SAT 
98.1 WGPA (Graduating Summe)
National honors society 
VP of my YAF chapter 
Treasure of a non profit 
Writing tutor 
Multi-year state qualifier for DECA (potential VP spot for my senior year) 
Volunteer hours at religion schooling for kids
Store cleric at a store 
Beach attendant at a beach club 

Another thing that I really don’t know if it could help me get into Lehigh is that my cousin went there and graduated top of his class at the business school. We share the same last name, but idk if that legacy counts at all. 

I also am meeting with the Lehigh representative at my school, which is great as well I think for enhancing my application.

I’m applying regular Bc I don’t really know if I wanna pay the huge price tags for lehigh just yet, and they don’t have early action which SUCKS bc I so would apply EA. 

last thing. For both Bing and lehigh, I’m gonna write probably an email or smth abt my desire to attend these schools, but idk if I’m doing too much to increase my odds.

Huh, I was thinking about right university for months and now come up with the idea of making ED to Lehigh. I am international student from Asia and I … need fin aid. And the thing that is ruining my application is that my family contribution is going to be $15k… 
I think if I get financial aid covering my tuition I can cope with that but the problem is tuition is $60k
I now Lehigh is need aware that's why I am trying to do early decision which somehow betters my situation ( I saw Ed acceptance rate is 72%) 
Do you think Lehigh is generous with money and can give me financial aid that I asked.

For better understanding my situation, here is my profile:
Gpa 4.0 of 4.0 got medal from government for being topper
Sat 1470
IELTS 7.0
2 times got medals from scientific Olympiads from the physics (btw my major is computer science)
2 years of experience as a tutor at the biggest English language teaching center in my city 
Have won several nationally known programs testing English ability.
Has been member of ecological party (for which members of this party spent days in desert doing volunteering)
Participated in several debugging competitions among high school students but didn't get ranked.
Have work experience of working for private company in the pandemic when physical force was needed.

When it comes to essays, I wrote one personal statement a year ago, but I think I have some time to work. Nevertheless I think it is still good.
Have 2 recommendations from my teacher and principal at high school and also 1 from the my employer at English language teaching center.

Overall how would you rate me? 
Should I do ED to Lehigh? 
Btw I'm on gap year now. Currently planning to attend local university.


The reason why I was rejected by all schools is that I ask for too much and I understand it. I realize that I don't have anything special in my portfolio that's why I am considering all the options but now come up with Lehigh and the only reason I am believing it is good is that Ed acceptance rate is pretty much high 70%+,
Some students could get the same amount of aid as far as I know. 

Would you advice me to try?"

If all else fails I can always leave the car in my home state and just get rides from LANta and Uber, my legs work fine too lol.

for some context, i was accepted into civil engineering in both colleges. however, at umd i was accepted into the scholars program. i’m looking to do work with sustainable buildings, so although i’m in civil engineering, i want to incorporate sustainability or architecture into my major.

i recently visited lehigh and found the atmosphere very relaxing and thought the campus was pretty, but i’m not really sold on the area around it. i know it’s a big school for frats and sororities, but don’t see myself joining that. my main problem is i’m not sure if there’s as much to do there if i’m dorming there for four years (since i am out of state)? compared to the umd area, it seems a lot more rural and i’m not really sure if that’s the vibe i’m looking for. i did. get accepted into civil engineering at lehigh, but i was looking to try and switch into the ideas program. this is honestly the main reason i’m thinking of picking lehigh because the program seems like it has a lot of opportunities and i feel like i might land a better job/internship at lehigh?? i also really like how i can kind of combine majors to make it my own because what i want to do is a little more specific than just civil engineering.

umd is more of a comfort zone for me because i do live in maryland. obviously because of this, it’s a lot cheaper for me and i won’t have to take as much loans. i’ve also researched clubs and i think it definitely has more extra curriculars i’m interested in. the scholars program also seems a nice way to stay connected with new people, but i guess i’m just not sure if it’s comparable to the connections i’d get at lehigh. i can minor in sustainability or architecture here at umd tho.

so would it be worth it to pay 50k to try and get into ideas or should i just stick with paying 30k at umd?"

Here are just a few of their misleading claims: 

**“The average Campus Managers earn $8K a school year. Top CMs earn $40K+.”**

*Reality: Mean, median, mode. With 250 campus managers, that could mean the top 10% make $40k, the next 15% make $25k, and the vast majority earn $270. Ask them how much the median CM earns? Or how many CM’s are within one or two standard deviations of the $8k mean?*

**“We cover all of the costs involved in training you.”**

*Reality: Training is unpaid.*

**“Gain entrepreneurial experience.”**

*Reality: An entrepreneur develops/patents a product, forms a business around it, secures investment, hires & fires employees, and is in control of setting the prices and sales territories. Campus Managers do none of those things. This job is like to being a Sales Rep where you sell $x and are paid a % of $x. However, legitimate sales reps usually have exclusive territories or industries, so that reps are not competing with each other. That’s not the case here. You’re competing with multiple other Campus Managers, sometimes in your own organization.*

I’m a high school senior just doing the typical college search, and Lehigh has definitely piqued my interest. I am aiming to major is biomedical/bioengineering and the things i’ve heard about Lehigh are great. But, i just want some first hand experience coming from actual students and alumni and figured this would be a great place to go. 

First, it’s college to obviously the academics are important. How is the engineering? Is it as top tier as people make it out to be? Best classes, how are the professors, class sizes for engineering vs class sizes for Gen Ed’s etc. 

Second, it’s college so of course the college life is also important. What is there to do on the weekends or when i’m bored and not studying or just need to take some stress off my shoulders? How are the gyms on campus? I’m an active lifter so it’s definitely a part of my daily schedule to get a good strength training / cardio workout in. 

Third, how’s living on campus? especially as a freshman, is it nice and easy to make friends? i haven’t had a chance to tour yet but i will be soon as i’m in a busy extracurricular season right now. I live 45 minutes away from Bethlehem so i doubt the climate is any different.

I’m here looking for brutally honest takes on my chances at Lehigh. I will give a complete over view of my academics, ECs, and all other required knowledge. I’ll let it be known that ED is my only way if any of getting into Lehigh which is why I ask if it’s worth me using my ED here or if I may better be applied at a slightly less selective school

Freshmen Year:
Freshmen year was tough. I was a very troubled child who thought college wasn’t for me. I was in L3 classes which in my school is the highest placement before AP yet did not apply myself. This amounted alongside with covid where I stopped attending school all together lead to a 2.2 weighted gpa. Yikes. I did not have ECs by this point either.

Sophomore Year:
With covid still raging on and living with my grandmother I found myself selected into a opt out program where I did not have physical teachers. I did what I needed for my core classes but barely passed electives or classes I simply found “useless” which lead me again to horrendous 2.5 gpa. By this point I was 16 and working to help support my family (yes we are poor) and did not do ECs other then maintaining my job.

Junior Year:
This is where I realize my potential as a student and begin applying myself. I was switched into some L3 classes early in the year and remained as vigilant in class as I could. However, with my family still struggling I picked up a second job to work more hours. However I still did ok with an approximately 3.5 gpa.

Senior Year (Now):
Senior year is by far my most successful in regards to my academics. Now with some money saved up I have been able to lay off my job slightly although not much. My effort junior year was recognized and I’m now taking 4 AP’s. This is where the heart of my resume will lie. I know that I messed up big time early on but I am hoping that my transcript with show enough improvement to bypass this. I also have been able to do some clubs in school and have gained leader ship positions in some very quickly. I am attending a leadership camp as well in the end of October which will hopefully provide more meat to my resume.

SAT Score:
My school sat was bad, as I did not get enough sleep or study at all. I got a 1250 but retook the October 1st where I was scoring 1300+ on PSAT. I am also scheduled for November 5th in case I flopped.

Overall I know my application is less then amazing but I am hoping that paired with a strong essay, demonstrated interest, and overall demonstration of improvement that I still might have a shot. However I still need the help of you guys in order to fully decide if EDing to Lehigh is the best choice for me."

I am currently heading into my fourth semester at a community college as a CS student and plan on transferring after the fall semester is complete. Lehigh is my first choice school and I'm looking to get some feedback from current enrollees and transfer students on my odds of getting accepted. Specifically on my SAT score.

I've taken the SAT once and I scored a 1410 (760 EBRW and 650 Math) I'm not too worried about the EBRW but the math troubles me as it's on the low end of their percentile. I'm curious as to whether it would be worth taking it to get a better math score. I have a 3.8 GPA in college and decent ECs (Mock trial, NHS, Phi Theta Kappa, and other clubs).

Also, if any past transfer students have insight into what courses they were able to transfer and those they weren't that would also be appreciated.

AP Scores: I earned a 5 on the AP European History exam in 10th grade and a 5 on the APUSH exam in 11th grade (don’t know how lol).

Lehigh! Register to Vote,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lehigh/comments/v1dbot/lehigh_register_to_vote/,8,0,2022-05-31 00:00:17,"Here's how to register to vote in Pennsylvania. These instructions work nationally so they can be shared with out of state friends or family and use non-partisan information.

Please share the info with anyone who might want to register, but hasn't had the chance, time, or info to do so yet.

**Basically: Find your state **[**here**](https://vote.gov/)** and use your state's online voter registration tool to register.** If your state is one of ten that does not currently allow online registration, this website will tell you and will tell you how to complete your registration - it's usually printing/filling out a form and mailing it in.

OR, you can [register to vote in person](https://www.usa.gov/election-office).

**FAQ:**

**Q: Am I already registered to vote? Am I eligible to vote? Do I need an ID to vote? When is my next election?**

Answers [here.](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/sviddomestic.htm)

**Q: If I'm 17, can I register to vote today?**

Yes, in a number of states! If you proceed through to your state's online voting portal, which can be found [here](https://vote.gov/), it'll tell you whether you're good to go.

**Q: I'll be moving to college soon. Where should I register to vote?**

Either place - your choice. If you register to vote at school, you'll need to register or re-register with the state your school's in. If you decide to keep your home address as your voting address, you can head home to vote or vote by absentee ballot (info below on how to request & return one).

**Q: What if I need to change my voter registration?**

Find your state [here](https://vote.gov/) and follow the instructions. If you have any further questions call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm).

**Q: Can I register to vote on election day?**

If your state is purple on [this map](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx), yes. So, your friend who forgot to register can still come with you and get it done.

**Q: What if my state doesn't have same-day registration?**

Then your state likely has a registration deadline of about 30 days. That means it has to be **in their hands** by 30 days before election day.

If you're not registering online, I'd walk it to their drop box (most states have them, usually all-hours & outside, call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm) to find out where theirs is) or walk it inside & hand it to them, or mail it if you're doing it very early so you can be sure it arrived.

But don't depend on the mail within ...6 weeks before an election. It's just too dicey.

**Q: Do I need to keep that voter registration card they'll mail me?**

It's useful for your reference & knowing your polling place, but it is not *required* for voting. 

**Q: Can I use a pen with pink/green/orange etc. ink on these forms/on my ballot?**

It's the kind of thing you don't think of, until you do. They only allow the most conservative of colors and inks, so keep it simple: blue or black ball point pen.

If you're entering most of the info on the computer and then printing it out, your printer's default black ink is also fine.

**Q: Can I get an absentee ballot?**

*Make sure you're registered to vote first.* Then, [this page](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/VoterInformation.htm) will tell you your state's requirements, and how to request an absentee ballot.

If you vote absentee, unless you're mailing it in *very early* (over six weeks before the election), drop it off at their drop box (most states have them, usually all-hours & outside, call your [local office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm) to find out where theirs is) or walk it inside & hand it to them so you can be sure it arrived.

You can do that any day before the election.

**Q: If I have a felony on my record, can I vote?**

Check [here](https://campaignlegal.org/restoreyourvote)! Often, yes.

**Q: I'm forgetful. Is there a way I can be sent reminders?**

Yes! [Here](https://iamavoter.com).

**Q: But, do the midterms matter in my state? My state's firmly Dem/Rep.**

They sure do. While your state may not be competitive in a presidential election, your *district* may be competitive for the House of Representatives and your Senator may be. Plus, governor, state reps, etc. 

There are purple spots in blue and red states - you may be in one, and your vote could swing a number of outcomes.

**Q: Where's competitive this year?**

There are particularly competitive races in more than half the states - either [Governor](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings), [House](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings), or [Senate](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings). 

The list: New Hampshire, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Texas, Virginia, Washington, California, Colorado, North Carolina, New Mexico, New Jersey, Maryland, Indiana, and Rhode Island.

If you live in any of these states, there's a lot of competition for your vote this year and it's a great chance to get your voice heard.

**Q: If my state isn't on the list, there's no point in voting, right?**

Incorrect! Local races are hugely important. Some examples: county prosecutors can, for instance, choose whether to prosecute non-violent drug crimes or sex work that is occurring without trafficking. 

They also recommend sentencing. Some are very strict, while some others choose to make those issues their lowest policy priority. 

State legislatures and governors decide, for instance, what happens with guns, lgbtq+ rights, and school funding in your state. 

State Attorneys General can defend state abortion laws or choose not to. 

Secretaries of State can help people register to vote or make it harder for them, within the already existing laws.

**tl;dr - register to vote. for a lot of reasons. if you read the news, or reddit, i'm sure you can easily come up with some.**

if you have questions about registering in your particular state, comment and i'll do my best to help. i did election stuff as a job for a few years, and i know how complicated finding the information you need can be. that's why i'm making these guides now."
Who do I contact about my senior grades?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lehigh/comments/v1ecxe/who_do_i_contact_about_my_senior_grades/,3,2,2022-05-31 00:57:53,"I was accepted RD, with A's and B's for my fall semester. But previously, I was a straight A student. This spring semester however, my grades drastically declined and I'm afraid I'll have a B, a C, and a F. However, some of this wasn't my fault since half of my grades for these classes were never put in. I got moved to a homebound program and was reliant on my teachers giving me my work. I wasn't allowed to go to school if I was in the program. My calculus teacher gave me my work in April when grades were due early may. The entire semesters work. And I didn't even have all of the quizzes or anything. I can go through my grades and there's like 6 assignments that I gave him and clearly labeled that he gave me 0s for during one MQ. For the last MQ I'm missing 4/6 grades. That I gave him! Some of this happened with the other classes but it wasn't as bad as my calc teacher.

 I'm extremely worried about my admission being rescinded so I was wondering who I email about this predicament? I also had a class change that I should've notified them about."

If anyone could talk about how their experience has been or give any input that’d be great.

Also I have a list of questions below that’d be great if anyone could help me out with any of them:

Do people ever have trouble finding internships/experience bc it’s not near or in a big city?
How active and useful is the alumni network?

Also, kind of random, but how big is skiing/ski culture at Lehigh? Im a big skier myself and would love if there were other students around to go with(especially not just to the local small shitty mountains but also up to Vt and stuff)"
