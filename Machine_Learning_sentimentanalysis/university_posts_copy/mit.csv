Difficulty in the Job Market (6-1 / 6-2),https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1gu9tel/difficulty_in_the_job_market_61_62/,24,12,2024-11-18 17:12:50,"Just wanted to write this post since I'm quite jaded and don't really know what to do from here.

I graduated with an M.Eng 6-2 a few years back but tried to develop skills in hardware and product development while dabbling in some CS here and there. I got a pretty cushy job that pays well, but the work is so dull and irrelevant that I find myself becoming debilitatingly depressed at the prospect of going back to work and pretending to be productive. My joy for engineering has been shattered and I decided I needed a move to something more invigorating.

I've been applying for jobs, exercising my network, and reaching out to anyone I know for referrals or pointers on finding work in the field of Electrical Engineering or Electrical design. After more than a year of searching, I'm finding absolutely nothing.

Every job I've applied to, even with multiple contacts and referrals is typically rejected same-day or ghosted. I've had my resume reviewed by those close to me with no obvious disqualifiers. I meet the qualifications for almost every position I've applied for. The ones that do end up interviewing me, I do very well and end up connecting with the engineer / recruiter in a meaningful way from what I can tell, but usually end up ghosted or with the ""Sorry, the position is quite competitive"" email.

I did actually end up with an offer at a company that I was quite excited about, but it was rescinded the same day due to an ""abrupt hiring freeze from above"". I didn't know companies could do this, but the whiplash of internal emotions broke me a bit, I was almost free.

Each rejection kills a bit more of me, and I just want out. I feel myself becoming more outclassed by the month, with recruiters shocked that I hadn't done ""6+ layer PCB designs in school"" or never conducted my own EMI testing.

Meanwhile my own systems architect at work asked me what a capacitor was, and I found myself with the urge to just quit right then and there.

Reason I'm writing this is to see if anyone else can resonate. The job market is not doing well obviously, and doesn't seem like it will be doing better anytime soon, and the backlog of new grads each year also not having work makes me pessimistic about the future.

Anyone else been in the same situation? I just simply don't know what to do except lie down and stare at the ceiling. My passion for engineering is dwindling by the day."

2. To what extent do you collaborate with other undergrads/grads in research?
3. To what extent do you collaborate with people from other institutions (Harvard, SAO, etc.)?
4. Is it easy to pursue a double major? Which ones are most convenient, and which ones would be most useful?
5. What cool things does your department/research group do? (anything you enjoy or think is unique to MIT, for example I know that EAPS drops pumpkins off their roof)
6. Is it hard to balance coursework with research? Do you find yourself working with other undergrads in your department to complete psets?

Bike Safety and Aggressive Drivers,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1gadhh9/bike_safety_and_aggressive_drivers/,27,16,2024-10-23 15:34:33,"I was commuting into work today on my bike after parking my car in a parking lot. I was on Vassar street, riding towards Mass Ave and passing Briggs field. This is literally the street where the MIT dorms are, childcare pickup, athletic fields, multiple speed bumps on the street. A street where clearly lots of people bike and walk.  
  
I encounter a section of the bike lane that is closed due to construction with signs telling me to use the road. I walk my bike onto the road, get on, and start riding to pass the construction. Two cars pass me just fine, giving me plenty of space to safely pass.  
  
A third car, a dark brown Honda Odyssey Minivan with MA plate no. 1HN551 started to pass me, very closely. Like just barely enough room for my handlebars and then he started to close the gap between him and the curb. I felt the side of his car pressing against my leg and I hit my brakes and yelled out ""HEY!"". He backed off a little and passed me and stopped ahead of me and rolled down his window.  
  
I assessed the situation, myself, and my bike. I had no injuries or damage to my bike. There were a few pedestrians around who looked around when I started yelling but most people just turned away and kept walking. Apart from his car brushing against me, I was just thankful that I was able to brake when I realized what was happening and get away from him before he squished me and my bike into the curb and potentially ran me over. Thank god I wasn't riding my fixie as I would have crashed, for sure.  
  
As I calmly approached his car, he starts yelling at me, calling me a ""f\*\*\*ing idiot"" and pointing towards the bike lane saying that I'm supposed to be on there. I try to explain that I was on it but it was literally blocked off and there was a sign that said bike lane closed due to construction and that I was waiting until I could safely get past the construction to get back on the bike lane but he was not hearing any of it.  
  
At the place where he had stopped and was yelling at me, the bike lane was clear again but it was not clear at the point where he was passing me and ran me off the road. I never even had a chance to safely stop, dismount, and get back on the bike lane. I just don't understand whether he was intentionally trying to teach me a lesson or lost me in his blind spot as he was passing and was now being defensive but either way, his driving was recklessly and aggressively and was blaming me for what happened.  
  
He proceeded to yell at me about why bikers are the reason why there are so many accidents in Boston and just kept saying ""YOU F\*\*\*ING IDIOT! YOU F\*\*\*ING IDIOT! YOU BIKERS ARE SO F\*\*\*ING STUPID!"". He drove off and I ended up catching up to him at the next light because of traffic and I wanted to get a picture of his plates and car. He rolled down his window again to keep yelling at me. I tried telling him calmly that I was not intending to start a fight or an argument but simply trying to explain to him why I was on the road and how I couldn't use the bike lane due to construction but he was not having any of it and just kept yelling at me ""YOU F\*\*\*ING IDIOT!"". I took some pictures of his license plate and his car but that's all I could do as he decided to continue driving down Galileo Galilei Way and I had to get to work on Main St. I called the non emergency line for Cambridge police and they listened to me, took my info and the description of the car and told me they would ""alert the units in the area"" but I'm pretty sure that they won't be following up with that at all.

I just don't get it. I did everything I was supposed to do, following all traffic laws and rules. Someone nearly mows me down and somehow I'm in the wrong?? How many people have to get seriously injured or involved in accidents? They just keep adding more bike lanes, even this week on Memorial Drive because of shit like this. Do those drivers not realize the more they drive like that, the worse it is going to get? I'm thankful I wasn't hurt physically but I am so pissed off right now."

I'm a sophomore 2A, currently taking 2.001, 18.03, 2.086, and a HASS. I applied to a program abroad for IAP, not really thinking I'd get it, but I did! I'm really excited about it, but it means that I won't be able to take 2.670 over IAP. 

I know it's not required for 2A, but I've recently found that I kind of like robots/autonomy stuff, and want to take 2.007 to explore that more. Since 2.670 is a pre-req, I won't be able to take 2.007 sophomore spring. 

Has anyone had any luck persuading professors to let them take 2.670 as a co-req with 2.007? Is it a bad choice just to take 2.007 junior spring/will it set me up poorly for other classes?

How common is a 5.0 GPA at MIT?,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1g4t0jg/how_common_is_a_50_gpa_at_mit/,60,43,2024-10-16 06:31:37,"At my school (ETH Zurich for those who know it) GPAs are on a 6.0 scale and basically no one achieves a perfect score. Even the brightest minds with multiple IMO/IPhO/IOI medals and an insane work ethic tend to fuck up in one or two exams during their degree.
However, when good students from ETH go on exchange to MIT, they achieve a perfect 5.0 pretty often. I’ve come across some other MIT students through work/LinkedIn/etc. and quite a few of them seem to have a 5.0. There may be some selection bias involved in this but you get my point. Since I didn’t find any grade distributions of final GPAs online, I wanted to ask the MIT folks here how common the 5.0 really is (in terms of percentage of the graduating class). Even if you don’t know any exact stats, feel free to give an educated guess. Also if there is any difference between majors (I assume there is), I‘d also be interested in that. 
Please don’t take this the wrong way. I‘m not trying to compare schools in any way, I‘m just genuinely curious about the grade distribution you guys have. Thanks in advance for your answers :)"

I've liked this person since the moment I saw them. Let's name them X. X is not only my type, but might be the most 'good' person I've ever met. They aren't afraid to be vulnerable and stick to their morals. 

I definitely wasn't thinking about asking out X anytime soon. I'm a freshman, so there's that whole power difference, adjusting and making friends thing. I also want time to sort out my feelings. Perhaps worst of all, they literally live right next to me. X's friend group (and now my friends) also live on the same section of the floor, and I really, really like everyone in the group. 

X hasn't dated before, and have indicated that they're open to dating. But because X is literally just too cool, they have cool friends, particularly one called Y. (If I were of a different sexual orientation, I would've totally had a crush on Y.) X's eyes light up whenever Y's name is mentioned, and they really are something of best friends. I could see them getting together, and I would be so happy for them and find them cute but feel sad and bitter inside at the same time.

If I don't ask out X, I know I'll regret it for the rest of my life. The question is to wait how long. I was thinking about, at earliest, spring semester, and ideally, when I'm a sophomore. I won't be able to see X over the summer. 

Currently, I'm thinking about getting closer to X by asking them to eat out with me every once in a while. Any advice?"

My pardon for intruding, but just to get things out there I did not attend MIT as a student. While I say I did not attend, I did in fact show up for a class at MIT. I went to Boston University, just across the river and was given a ""challenge"" so to speak to attend any possible MIT class and either answer or ask a question in dumb fashion. 

My friend and I both showed up on general campus and began asking around what's the earliest class that's about to happen. We were led to a large lecture hall that was to be held for an advanced mathematics class of some sort. 

Upon the class beginning, my friend was planted near center of the hall while I was to the far right, closest to the door. I was originally supposed to be the one to ask whatever question, but my anxiety got the best of me. I signaled to my friend what was happening and he stepped in. 

He essentially asked to translate common math symbols on the board to English. Y'all went/go to MIT, I don't feel the need to explain this one. I do have this on video. 

Immediately after he asked his question, he left the room leaving just me. Watching the courage reign through no matter the embarrassment on his end was inspiring to me, so I ended up asking my original ""idiotic"" question.

This is an exact word for word on what happened:

Me: \*Raises hand\* keep in mind, I'm on the far right side of the hall. It is harder for the prof to see me. Someone maybe 8 seats down sees me and signals to the professor to call on me. 

\*Teacher points to me\* 

here we go folks

Me: ""I know this is a strange question, but what college is this by any chance?""

Prof: ""I'm sorry???""

Me: ""What college are we currently at?""

Prof: ""Ummmmmmmmmmmmm the Massachusetts Institute of Technology?""

Me: \*While prof utters the college, I slowly begin to lift from my chair\*

Me: ""Oh fuck, wrong school!"" I immediately run from my seat through the doors, leaving a laughing classroom behind. 

To this day I always think about it since I got my friend's question on film, but never mine (and mine was def funnier). 

Is there by any chance someone from that class may have caught it on film?????? I know I'm throwing a reel into a large sea here, but maybe there is hope out there. 

Roast me as much as you'd like, I probably deserve it. "

My STEM-focused daughter is trying to figure out which majors to explore and I suggested she chat with a few students across the various majors she is interested in to understand a bit more. Computational biology caught her fancy when she interned for an immunotherapy company over the summer.

Hi everyone! Life has been messy recently. 

I graduated in 2021 with a BS in mechanical engineering (2A). I have been feeling pretty lost in the past three years since I have never truly enjoyed any of my jobs. I have recently been thinking that maybe I chose the wrong major, since I seem to like more the coding part of my projects. I have been wondering if  instead of product design (which is what I've done for most of my roles ), I should have focused in another mechanical engineering area, like  robotics. Or a completely different major, like CS. 

Furthernmore, I also had to leave the US in July (I was an international student who after 3 years of OPT didn't get the lottery visa), and so now I not only have to find a job but also restart my whole life. Anyways, it has been some very hard months and I feel super lost and money is running out. So I saw this program and thought it might help... has anyone done it or know about anyone who did it? I want to know if it is actually worth it. Thanks! "

One or two well-paid summers would go a long way. Also, I can still do UROPs during the school year and IAP.

PhD in Political Science (Security Studies): What's It Like?,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1f9i4tb/phd_in_political_science_security_studies_whats/,4,0,2024-09-05 09:21:33,"Hi all. I've just finished my master's degree in International Security (joint master's, at three universities/countries) and have somehow knocked it out of the park. I've got the highest grade classification (Distinction), a 4.0 GPA equiv, and I strongly suspect will be in the top 10 - potentially top 5 or higher - of my cohort (out of 99 students). I've never thought of doing a PhD before, but this has opened the possibility of dreaming a bit bigger.

I've seen MIT offers a [PhD in Political Science](https://oge.mit.edu/programs/political-science/) with a concentration on security studies, which - on the face of it - looks incredibly appealing. The ability to cross-register with Harvard for a few modules also sounds like the best of both worlds. That said, I'd love to know more about what the Center for International Studies is like, what doing a PhD at MIT is like, and whether I'm getting a bit too big for my boots of thinking to apply for this. In brief:

* For those who do their studies at the Center for International Studies, how good is it in terms of research calibre?
* The PhD seems long (6-7 years expected), and there's a risk of the first two years treading a lot of similar ground to my master's degree. For modules that I've already done in my master's, can these theoretically be swapped with other modules (i.e. if I wanted to sit in on a CS course/take a cross-registered course at Harvard instead, would that be kosher)?
* How 'common'/feasible is it to graduate earlier from a PhD - i.e. to complete it in five years rather than 6-7?
* Being frank, the alumni network and brand recognition does factor in to considering this. While both clearly hold for undergrad level in tech/science majors, does the same weight apply at PhD level with a focus on political science? - For reference, my research would be on certain tech applications in international security.
* I have zero intention of working in academia beyond this. My hope hereafter would be to move into private-sector industry relevant to my field. While *usually* PhDs don't seem a good route into this, the network/teaching/etc make this seem more plausible with years at MIT under my belt. Have I got the wrong end of the stick there, and to what extent is that myth more than fact?
* Last one, really: My master's was outstanding, but my bachelor's (many moons ago - graduated in 2015) was mid. Good (a 'two one' or 'upper second class' in the UK), but not the highest grade (first). Otherwise, a lot of good work XP and a first-gen uni student. Does a not-excellent BA grade scupper this entirely?

I appreciate any help you can give with this. Only other consideration I can think of is that I'm an international student (British). Hope you're all having a wonderful day. :) "

Though I know students have the option to opt-in, many of the frosh don’t understand what that means/even knows what dorm spam is.

I haven't been around an academic environment for a long time and I can appreciate in hindsight MIT for the amazing place that it is (after some of the stress, psets, and financial strain have faded away from view).

People who go to this school are so smart, so forward thinking, so open-minded, so interested in changing the world and in pursuing their careers. The most brilliant and inspiring people I've met in my life, I met while I was at MIT. The best friendships I've made in my life were with people I met at MIT. Since exiting the bubble of MIT, I have felt widely misunderstood. I run into many people with closed mindsets, steeped in tradition, blocked by bureaucracy and cronyism and politics, who are stuck in the way that the world is and are convinced that things will only be as they are. I miss talking to people who focused instead on what the world could be, all the hope that lied ahead for the future, all those projects toward building a better world, and all those ideas to make the world a better place for everybody.

MIT is a very special place. I have yet to find another place where people worked toward a better future quite as passionately as they do there. Not every Nobel Laureate goes to MIT, but the people I met there were absolutely brilliant, culturally aware, and driven to do something inspiring."

I'm seeking advice on which courses to take at MIT and Harvard. My wife has recently been awarded a fellowship with the Knight Science Journalism program, and as part of the fellowship, I have the opportunity to enroll in classes at these prestigious institutions.

A bit about myself: I'm from Brazil, 37 years old and have been programming since I was 14. I started working with Python back in 2005 and have since developed a strong foundation in software development, particularly in the realms of free/libre software (FLOSS), open data, GNU/Linux systems administration and data journalism. Over the years, I've taught courses in electronics, Arduino, and Python programming, sharing my passion for technology with others.

I also studied Telecommunications Engineering, completing nearly all the coursework, including subjects like calculus, physics, and statistics, though I did not finish the degree. This academic background has provided me with a solid foundation in analytical and technical skills.

Currently, I run a small company in Brazil where we focus on projects that have a positive social impact using FLOSS and open data. We develop tools and platforms primarily using Python, Django, PostgreSQL (including PostGIS) and scrapy, mainly. Our work has supported numerous journalistic investigations and civic tech initiatives.  One of our most significant contributions has been the creation of [Brasil.IO](https://brasil.io/), an accessible open data portal that enables citizens to access Brazilian open data - this portal was crucial during the pandemic when the federal government stopped publishing daily municipal-level data, allowing people to stay informed and researchers to have access to this data. Recently, we’ve also been working with large language models (LLMs) to automate various tasks across several projects, including transcription, summarization, and extracting structured data from texts. If you're curious about the kind of work we do, feel free to check out some of our free/libre software projects [here](https://pythonic.cafe/software-livre.html) and more details on our projects [here](https://pythonic.cafe/projetos.html) (in Portuguese, but easily translatable).

I’ve been exploring the courses available through the following links: [MIT](https://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/) and [Harvard](https://courses.my.harvard.edu/psp/courses/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=HU_CLASS_SEARCH).

Do the stores in the area typically sell out of stuff fast? I'm afraid with MIT, Harvard, BU, and Northeastern that by the time I fly in (the night before move-in), I won't be able to buy anything.

I've been looking at the Target near Fenway to try and preorder, but you can only do so the day of.  If I don't try and order for pick-up, I can run the risk of shipping stuff to the dorm (so if it's not on-time, it's either early and returned or late and I can't shower/sleep/live) or just pray everything is still there day of.

Research Opportunities and Visa Requirements at MIT for MS post-graduate,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1evw75q/research_opportunities_and_visa_requirements_at/,3,2,2024-08-19 07:57:58,"Hello everyone,

I am currently a master’s student in Switzerland, set to graduate in December 2024. I plan to apply for a PhD program at MIT, with the intention of starting in September 2025. However, I would like to find a research opportunity at MIT from January 2025 until my PhD program begins(if admitted anywhere). 

I have a few questions and would greatly appreciate any advice or experiences:

1. **Research Opportunities**: Has anyone here secured a short-term research position at MIT before starting their PhD, as an international student? I am graduating master's soon, so can not be a visiting(exchange) student anymore.
2. **Visa Considerations**: As an international student, I’m curious about the visa requirements for such a short-term stay. Is it possible to obtain a visa specifically for a research assistant position, either paid or unpaid? Alternatively, does anyone have experience doing short-term research (e.g., 3 months) under the Visa Waiver Program (ESTA)? How feasible is this, and is it legal to do it?

Thank you in advance for your help!"

I'm from a super small school (<100 class size) and have cruised through most classes my entire life without doing much besides paying attention. I did plenty of academic competitions outside of class, but it's different from a genuinely hard class. Now I'm looking at the hours for my classes and I need to study upwards of 40-50 hours a week outside of class...I feel like there's a zero percent chance I can actually do that much work and study well and keep my grades high without absolutely imploding. I'm just worried I'll fail and realize MIT wasn't for me. It's dumb but I'd love to hear how other students got through it since I'm having a lot of thoughts that are making MIT seem terrifying. Also, I might be going into medicine after undergrad. Although it's very much not set in stone(majoring in engineering, most likely material or chemical), I've enjoyed anatomy. If MIT is so difficult, I'm worried having B's and even C's would really hurt my chances of med school."

Would it be advisable to take one of these extra digit courses or even both (or will it be too much)? I’m Planning on majoring in course 6, but I took a look at the syllabus for 18.022 and 8.022 and they seem p interesting.

Also, do they make exceptions to the requirements? Over the next year I'll be deciding between courses 2A and 6-2. The MISTI website does not list course 2 students as being eligible to study at ICL.

I am a rising sophomore majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Ever since I was young, I have had a passion for aviation and dreamed of becoming a pilot. Long story short, I am now pursuing an Engineering career here. I love my current major and I excel in it and I do want to pursue a career in electronics. However, I found this year about an opportunity to study aviation in Europe for two years, where I would earn all necessary licenses and certificates to become a pilot. 

The idea seemed quite off to me since I am currently studying engineering and expect to pursue a career in the field, which I genuinely enjoy. However, I thought, why not? I had already planned to obtain a private pilot certificate for personal purposes after my graduation. Studying it comprehensively over two years in Europe appeared to be a sensible option, particularly as I may not have free time post-graduation.

This program would require me to take a two-year break from my engineering studies after my sophomore year, resuming my junior and senior years upon return. I am really drawn to this opportunity, but I am also weighing the risks. What do you guys think?

1. Do you think it is advisable to take this break for aviation training?
2. How might a two-year gap affect my prospects for internships and employment during the latter part of my degree and post-graduation?
3. Are there any potential drawbacks that could impact my future career in electronics engineering that your foresee?

Thank you in advance, and I hope you have a great day/night!!!"
Is a dual major of 6 and 21M (music) and a minor in 8 or 18 realistic?,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1dys6eh/is_a_dual_major_of_6_and_21m_music_and_a_minor_in/,3,14,2024-07-09 03:14:13,"Hello all,  
Incoming freshman here. When declaring a major, I plan to do a dual major of 21M and most likely 6, and I was looking into a minor in 8 or 18. Is this realistic to finish within four years? I have looked at the course catalogs, and my understanding is that:  
6-5 (for example) requires 15 classes.  
HASS requires 8.  
Music requires 5 beyond HASS at minimum.  
A minor in physics requires 6 classes.  
GIRs require 6.  
This adds up to exactly 40 classes. Assuming labs and other classes, is this possible?  
Thank you all so much!"

PhD CEP Program Insights,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1dx2jo1/phd_cep_program_insights/,2,5,2024-07-06 23:22:47,"Hi folks,

I am a Canadian undergrad looking into the PhD CEP program at MIT and I wanted to know if anyone in the program could provide insight into their experience so far.

Amongst other things, I'm curious about how the CEP school complements the PhD. Moreover, I am a little apprehensive about the fact that students are expected to finish their thesis in two years...is this actually doable?

How do people typically pay for their last year in business school? MIT says loans are available, but are there other funding mechanisms? As a Canadian, I am unfamiliar with the insane tuition fees, hence my concerns. I heard some graduates of the program often go into consulting as experts in their area, a lucrative job that would quickly allow for the repayment of any debt, but is it common to land such lucrative careers after this degree?

Also, how large are the cohorts? Is it a tight-knit program? Would you say it is more or less competitive to get in than other programs?

Is it everything you hoped for? If you could go back, would you choose the program at MIT once again?

Cheers,

Justin"

Hey! Transfer student here! I plan to major in Math with CompSci (18C), and was wondering if 3 years at MIT are enough to complete 18C degree without taking? I have checked the requirements and it all seems quite possible, but still would love to hear what others think!

I am just not sure that I will have many credits transferred from my current uni, since it is far easier than MIT in general. I could only maybe transfer some credits from IB as (I got 7s in HL: math aa, econ, physics) but not from uni. So I was considering taking ASEs... but I am too afraid of failing them and then having F in the transcript... I might consider taking them in the winter or next summer, but I am afraid if they will restrain me from registering for some courses this/next semester... So ...

Will I be fine without taking ASEs this summer?

Common misconceptions about the recent protests,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1d0b7iz/common_misconceptions_about_the_recent_protests/,0,62,2024-05-25 12:43:11,"There's a lot of misinformation going around (some of it coming straight from [ administrator](https://orgchart.mit.edu/letters/actions-encampment) [ messaging](https://chancellor.mit.edu/faq-campus-events)) that I would like to clarify in the interest of public sanity and de-escalation. I'll be answering some common misconceptions. (Source: MIT grad student; I have been heavily involved in research regarding encampment demands, and have read negotiation transcripts. Edit: have also been involved in the protests!)

* **Misconception: ""Protestors rejected a reasonable offer from admin""**

The [ demands](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_yds5vrf5AVZSbyiMvoxpVsbf_mLmOe8INJ-rT0fV_g/edit) from the protestors (and their subsequent [ amendment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QdJ73GmD2_w-gNTSR_Wmo3AD9gkfaHZhxaJlNrBXys4/edit)) were to end sponsorship of MIT research by the Israeli Ministry of Defense (IMOD). MIT has an existing policy (the [ 2021 Suri guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTNNd9iZ3eN55KoazTXLkEuiwU9lIgunkXxky34YYt9tbToGyXULtuxemwwli34U_bCjHjns-ua49tu/pub)) to reject funding from institutions that are involved in human rights violations. It chose to enforce these guidelines to end collaborations with [ Skolkovo Institute in Russia](https://skoltech.mit.edu/) (due to their invasion of Ukraine) and with the [ Saudi oil company ARAMCO](https://orgchart.mit.edu/letters/decision-regarding-collaboration-saudi-aramco) (due to their assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi).

The administrators **outright refused** to enforce this policy with regards to the Israeli Ministry of Defense. They made vague offers of future meetings with the International office and demanded protestors end the encampment in exchange for this. When pressed about the Suri guidelines and their application to the IMOD, they said they likely wouldn't apply because of the ""nuance"" of the situation. This is **ludicrous** and I explain it in the next misconception.

* **Misconception: ""But the Suri guidelines don't apply in this case""**

More detailed information about the guidelines and their applicability is provided [ here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTNNd9iZ3eN55KoazTXLkEuiwU9lIgunkXxky34YYt9tbToGyXULtuxemwwli34U_bCjHjns-ua49tu/pub) but I will summarize here:

The [ 2021 Suri Report](https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/sites/default/files/reports/2020-12_Final_Report_of_the_Ad_Hoc_Faculty_Committee_on_Guidelines_for_Outside_Engagements.pdf) provides a way to evaluate and reject unethical “grants, gifts, and any other associations and collaborations involving MIT with governments, corporations, foundations, or private individuals, domestic or foreign” by sorting them into ""red light"" and ""yellow light"" categories. “Red lights” must be automatically rejected. An abbreviated version of the categories was published[ here](https://orgchart.mit.edu/system/files/reports/20210507_Guidelines_for_Outside_Engagements.pdf). Of note is the following “red light” violation: 

>*“Do the institutional partner’s policies and their enforcement in this engagement involve a gross violation of political, civil, or human rights?”*

On p. 19 of the detailed report, “gross violations of human rights” are defined as follows:

>*“It is generally assumed that genocide, slavery and slave trading, murder, enforced disappearances, torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, prolonged arbitrary detention, deportation or forcible transfer of population, and systematic racial discrimination fall into this category. Deliberate and systematic deprivation of essential foodstuffs, essential primary health care, or basic shelter and housing may also amount to gross violations of human rights.”*

The Israel Military has committed hundreds of human rights violations against Palestinians since the start of the war. A small fraction of the instances include targeting [refugee camps](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-12-30-2023-5f475fb7221f7e97251f58c3aae1aeb8), [schools](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1148031), and [hospitals](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/02/09/israel-gaza-health-care-hospitals-genocide-icj/); arbitrarily [displacing](https://www.refugeesinternational.org/statements-and-news/mass-displacement-in-gaza-reaches-unconscionable-levels/), [disappearing](https://bylinetimes.com/2024/03/28/israel-disappearing-thousands-of-palestinians/), [torturing](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/middleeast/israel-sde-teiman-detention-whistleblowers-intl-cmd/index.html), and [executing](https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/2024/1/18/video-shows-aftermath-of-a-summary-execution-of-15-men-in-a-gaza-apartment) [civilians](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-03-31/ty-article-magazine/.premium/israel-created-kill-zones-in-gaza-anyone-who-crosses-into-them-is-shot/0000018e-946c-d4de-afee-f46da9ee0000); creating artificial [famine](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/04/09/gaza-israels-imposed-starvation-deadly-children) and [drought](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68969239); [mass destruction of housing](https://apnews.com/article/un-report-gaza-destruction-housing-economy-recovery-4f61dcca7db3fd5eb3da5c6a25001e12); assassinating over [100 journalists](https://cpj.org/2024/05/journalist-casualties-in-the-israel-gaza-conflict/) and [250 humanitarian workers](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/05/14/gaza-israelis-attacking-known-aid-worker-locations); and [calling, on the record, for a genocide](https://momentmag.com/israeli-politicians-incitement-quotes/). There is unequivocal and abundant proof of them committing 9 out of the 11 violations listed in the Suri guidelines, and they have been sent to the Hague for the possibility of another one.

This isn’t even getting into the political and civil rights violations happening, particularly in the West Bank.

* **Misconception: ""But Skoltech is different because it was an 'institutional partnership'""**

In 2022, when MIT [ended its collaboration](https://skoltech.mit.edu/announcement) with Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (which it had [helped establish](https://skoltech.mit.edu/about)), **45 grants** were immediately cut, impacting **26 PIs** (per [2022](https://vpf.mit.edu/system/files/downloads/Brown%20Book%202022/4_Appendicies/6_Research%20Expenditures%20by%20Sponsor%202022%20v2.pdf) and [2023](https://vpf.mit.edu/system/files/downloads/Brown%20Book%202023/Appendices/6_Research%20Expenditures%20by%20Sponsor%202023.pdf) financial reports; for IMOD only 3 grants would be ended, affecting only 3 PIs). [Exchange programs](https://languages.mit.edu/creating-connections-in-times-of-isolation-mit-skoltech-conversation-exchanges/), [recruitment avenues](https://skoltech.mit.edu/about/history#Students), and [MIT-taught Skoltech classes](https://energy.mit.edu/news/mit-faculty-energize-launch-of-skoltech-curriculum/) were canceled, in addition to these grants. The sponsorship constituted $16 million – 10x more than the current IDF sponsorship. MIT unilaterally stopped (without input from graduate students or faculty) its affiliation with Skoltech, and provided transitional funding for the impacted scientists at MIT. This is no different from what would happen if it ended sponsorship of research by IMOD (and it was orders of magnitude more impactful).

* **Misconception: ""But MIT doesn't have the money to meet these demands""**

The research ties in question (\~$1.6 million in active grants) constitute <0.05% of MIT's standing budget (\~$5 billion). When MIT [ended its research collaborations with Skolkovo Institute](https://skoltech.mit.edu/announcement), [$16 million worth of grants](https://vpf.mit.edu/system/files/downloads/Brown%20Book%202023/Appendices/6_Research%20Expenditures%20by%20Sponsor%202023.pdf) (10x more than the IMOD grants) were immediately terminated.

* **Misconception: ""But they're targeting students/postdocs and their salaries""**

A central part of the protestors’ [demands](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QdJ73GmD2_w-gNTSR_Wmo3AD9gkfaHZhxaJlNrBXys4/edit) is to provide transitional funding to workers impacted by the funding change. This was done when sponsorships by Skoltech and ARAMCO were ended. Protestors are not targeting the workers or their ability to do the research itself. Lab members were contacted before the protests to hear their input and assure them that transitional funding is a central demand.

* **Misconception: ""MIT doesn't actually do research for the IDF""**

Here is one of the \~dozen MIT publications we’ve found that explicitly mention the IMOD as a sponsor: 

""[Sentinel cells programmed to respond to environmental DNA including human sequences](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01431-1)”

Many are published in journals (e.g. IEEE, where many drone swarm papers are published) that don’t require listing acknowledgements, though.

* **Misconception: ""Protestors are trying to end collaboration with Israeli colleagues""**

The [demands](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QdJ73GmD2_w-gNTSR_Wmo3AD9gkfaHZhxaJlNrBXys4/edit) do not say anything about collaborations between MIT and Israeli researchers. The demand is to end sponsorship of MIT research by the Israeli ministry of defense (identified by its sponsor ID #001134 in the [MIT financial records](https://vpf.mit.edu/about-vpf/publications)). 

* **Misconception: ""Protestors are impinging on faculty academic freedom""**

The [demands](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QdJ73GmD2_w-gNTSR_Wmo3AD9gkfaHZhxaJlNrBXys4/edit) do not mention the research itself, which can (and certainly would) continue. In fact, the PIs who would be affected by the funding change [have many other grants](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTYvTT38YI6vf14opjBCB738ZesXIkGXwZ5sX6N49xB8mJj3zHQPYStojRzi0Qdrf-pTxxsmvUOT-SM/pub) (IMOD sponsorship is a negligible amount, \~0.01-1% of each lab’s budget) for very similar projects. The issue is with the sponsorship of the projects. Academic freedom does not include the freedom to accept sponsorship from unethical sources.

* **Misconception: ""MIT can't cut ties with the IDF because Israel is an ally of the US""**

This isn't a valid reason to silence criticism of, or cut ties with, the Israel Military (again, Israeli military, not citizens, not even the government). MIT should not engage with entities committing gross human rights violations, regardless of US foreign policy. Also – I would again like to draw your attention to the case of the [ Saudi company ARAMCO](https://orgchart.mit.edu/letters/decision-regarding-collaboration-saudi-aramco) and MIT's ending of those research collaborations.

* **Misconception: ""Protestors were harassing Jewish students""**

First of all, **no, a thousand times no**. This would be unequivocally denounced at a protest.

I would also like to note that a significant fraction of protestors were Jewish (part of the Jews For Ceasefire organization, one of the largest organizations in the Coalition for Palestine).

If you actually meant *Israeli* students, also no.

If you actually meant *counter-protesting MIT Israel Alliance* students, also no. They regularly entered the encampment and walked around freely, [ eating our food](https://x.com/gabrimartini_ny/status/1783930528158130382) (which we offered them), [ blasting music](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7EdHgyuHP-/?img_index=3), and [ harassing us](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7F4EEntcx6/). Some of them took our criticism of Israel's military and the ongoing genocide as a personal attack on them, which you can interpret as you wish.

* **Misconception: ""Protestors were chanting hateful things""**

First -- there are videos going around where someone has mistranslated an Arabic chant as ""death to Zionists"" or worse, ""death to J---"". The protestor was actually chanting ""death to Zionism"" but the contextual translation is more mild. Closer to ""down with Zionism.""

A debunk of these (frankly racist) intentional mistranslations is [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7CjbINOCPC/)

“All out to MIT”: Exploiting campus access at the MIT and Harvard camps,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1cwr3a7/all_out_to_mit_exploiting_campus_access_at_the/,159,54,2024-05-20 21:33:11,"Why did Harvard protestors dismantle their own camp, while MIT’s camp was dismantled by police? One explanation I’ve heard is that Harvard showed patience, listened to students, and worked out a deal. I see a simpler explanation: Harvard closed its gates, MIT could not. MIT’s open campus was leveraged dangerously by visitors and made Harvard's hands-off approach impossible. I worry about how these events will change the open campus that most of us value.

The differences between Harvard and MIT's encampment risks are the focus of this post. To be clear, I am *not* claiming that MIT students or administrators made the best or only decisions available, just that MIT's situation was comparatively volatile and dangerous. But we can't examine how the actions taken would have differed from actions not taken.

Many at MIT have been closer to these events than me, so it helps if they can add other relevant facts in the comments. I try to use third-party sources, but I include protestor and admin sources where third parties exclude important details.

**Events at Harvard**

Harvard Yard is fully fenced. During past protests and encampments, Harvard has closed all its gates.\[1\]\[2\]  Harvard shut the gates again well before its encampment began.\[3\] By restricting the Yard to Harvard ID access, Harvard’s administration could afford to be patient.

Once the camp began on April 24, the gates locked out visiting protestors and counterprotestors.\[3\]\[4\] Harvard’s pro-camp and anti-camp students were free to escalate, and did many times, but they could not welcome other groups into the campus.\[1\]

On May 10, Harvard issued involuntary leaves to twenty remaining student campers and effectively locked them in the Yard. Suspended campers couldn’t enter through ID checkpoints, so leaving the Yard for any reason meant abandoning the camp. Within the Yard, campers lost access to bathrooms and food.\[3\]\[4\] Under this duress, the four remaining residents of the camp submitted to Harvard’s demands and declared that the camp had “outlived its usefulness.”\[3\]

By tightly controlling access, Harvard had little to gain by bargaining with the camp and not much to lose by letting it be. Administrators successfully excluded visitors and later exercised their option to blockade the camp. In the end, their only real concession to the camp was to reconsider the suspensions.\[3\]

**Events at MIT**

On April 21, MIT’s camp began on the Kresge lawn, one of the most accessible spaces on MIT’s campus. For two weeks, MIT camp stayed open to all and was peacefully managed, despite efforts by some to escalate and spark conflicts. Some anti-camp students and visitors sought to provoke campers into disputes and pressure MIT to intervene against the camp.\[5\] On May 1, some pro-camp students began to block arterial roads and organize unannounced secondary protests.\[6\] Each group sought to raise the cost of MIT’s inaction.

The “peaceful equilibrium” was cushioned by MIT camp marshals, police, faculty, and staff.\[5\] But it tipped on May 3, when the Israeli American Council and Boston's Party for Socailism and Liberation (BPSL) each called hundreds of visitors to dueling events around the campsite.\[7\]\[8\]\[9\] Actions by chapters of these groups were a prelude to the violence against campers at UCLA and the building occupation at Columbia.\[10\]\[11\] Although marshals and police could keep the peace between small groups, the outside protests dwarfed all earlier events. Meanwhile, students [declared the camp's basic demand](https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1crjj5k/stuff_to_know_about_mit_protest_demands_research/) non-negotiable, ending an option for settlement.\[12\]\[13\]

Ahead of the dual protests, MIT tried to impose camp access controls. Unable to close the Kresge lawn to outside groups, MIT instead put tall construction fences around the camp to limit entrypoints and “maintain separation” between protests.\[12\]\[13\]\[14\] MIT Police added MIT ID checks several days later, creating the access conditions Harvard had from the start.\[13\]\[14\] Pro-camp students took offense at these efforts. One student described “how tone-deaf it is to fence in people and add a checkpoint” to an encampment for Palestinian rights.\[14\]

On May 6, after a final round of negotiations failed, MIT demanded all students leave the camp or face interim suspensions.\[12\]\[13\]\[15\] Repeating media posts by student groups, at least four outside groups published “[all](https://x.com/NationalSJP/status/1787545968021578164) [out](https://www.instagram.com/ffcof2020/p/C6ow1hPOY3l/?img_index=1) [to](https://x.com/readytoescalate/status/1787562350217724205) [MIT](https://www.instagram.com/bostonpsl/reel/C6o4V6SOw5Z/)” broadcasts. One of these callouts came from a group advising followers to refuse negotiations, barricade buildings, and use black-bloc tactics to incite police crackdowns. Hundreds of MIT affiliates and visiting protestors amassed at the campsite and surrounded police.\[16\]\[17\] In a simultaneous action aided by the BPSL, local high school students arrived for a rush-hour sitdown blockade of Mass Ave.\[18\]\[19\]\[20\] As crowds increased and actions multiplied, protestors demolished the fence and re-entered the camp en masse.\[16\]\[17\]

The May 6 standoff proved everyone managing the camp was right to worry about their respective worst cases. Clearly, no one controlled who showed up at the camp or on campus. Clearly, overtly violent groups had entered the fray, while others enlisted high schoolers to join in.  Clearly, MIT was planning to end the camp. And clearly, protestors would reject efforts to control camp access and security. The actions on May 6 put de-escalation and life safety measures well beyond anybody’s reach.

A few days later, MIT suspended over twenty students, although students were still free to enter and leave the camp.\[12\]\[13\] Unlike Harvard, MIT called state police to close the camp and arrest ten students who refused the option to leave.\[12\]\[13\]

**Holding the Gates Open**

Harvard locked out visiting protestors, locked in protesting students, and sapped the camp's remaining resolve. MIT initially allowed open access to the campsite, having few other options. When open access became unstable, students and visitors rejected the administration’s effort to impose access control.

It would be nice if skillful negotiation explained Harvard’s police-free resolution. But over the life of the two camps, the biggest difference is that Harvard kept its gates shut. There may have been other paths MIT could have taken, but Harvard’s path wasn’t one of them.

Generations of MIT students, staff, alums, police, administrators, and faculty have worked to keep MIT’s campus “aggressively ungated.”\[21\] During the encampment, our openness was weaponized against us. Visitors were summoned to escalate student actions and aggress members of our community. It seems “all out to MIT” tactics are here to stay, if the BPSL’s notices about other MIT protests this year are any indication.

Among many other hard questions that MIT faces right now, I wonder how we will be able to hold the gates open.

I’m looking to read the protest demands carefully and generously, then consider MIT’s constraints generously. My conclusion is that if the core demands had broad support on campus—and I can't say whether they do or do not—MIT could not agree to them for principled, consistent reasons.

Please add anything I’ve missed about the SAGE and MIT positions in the comments. Factual corrections or additional details are appreciated.

(If you’re here for hot takes, you’re in the wrong thread. I’m not saying what MIT should do about the demands, I'm not sharing opinions about Israel's military, and I'm not sharing opinions about student protests or MIT's response. Please feel welcome to share your opinions about these separate topics in other posts about these topics.)

**The demands**

The core demands of the Scientists against the Genocide Encampment (SAGE) are:

1. The immediate termination of two active faculty contracts with the Israel Ministry of Defense (IMoD)
2. A ban on future faculty contracts with IMoD.\[1\]

The protestors identified these contracts in the MIT Brown Books, which provide detailed information about all sponsored research projects on campus. SAGE says the following two basic research contracts are active:

* “Autonomous Robotic Swarms: Distributed Coordination and Perception.” SAGE alleges this project can be used to “target Gazan citizens or American protestors.”\[1\]
* “Field-capable Bacterial Biosensors with Hyperspectral Reporters for Remote Detection of Analytes of Interest."" I have not seen any specifically alleged concerns about this project. \[3\]

SAGE proposes to end current funding for these projects, but says the research activities can proceed with alternative funding.\[2\] SAGE also says a review of project-specific human rights risks or new limits on foreign military research would only work if they prejudged the two contracts as terminated.\[2\] So while their public statements do take issue with at least one of the research subjects, the demands focus only on the sponsor.

Two facts about these contracts have been widely misreported. First, the contracts appear to be funded by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), not IMoD.\[4\] As the “direct sponsor,” IMoD chooses which academic research projects to fund. DoD involvement does not appear to be an important consideration to SAGE. I suspect, but don't know for certain, that ending contracts with a primary government funder could add complications for MIT.

Second, SAGE has said that “more than $11M” has been funded through DoD/IMoD since 2015.\[1\]\[3\] But the data SAGE has published duplicates balances for many multi-year awards. Once deduplicated, the amount allocated by DoD since 2015 is just under $4 million, of which $3.2 million has been spent.\[4\] The demands do not address spent research funds, only the unspent $265,000 balance on the two active grants.\[13\] 

Although factual accuracy is helpful to evaluating the demands, the cost of the demands is not a material issue for either side. Without even considering the merits of the claim—i.e. that the research is causing immediate harm—the issue is that the demands are inconsistent with MIT's position on faculty research freedom and inconsistent with past MIT actions.

**Conflicts between the demands and MIT’s research policy**

Meeting protestors’ core demands would require MIT to do something it has not done before: electively ban faculty from working with a specific sponsor. Doing this would conflict with the MIT faculty’s longstanding position on “research freedom,” which A) lets faculty freely choose collaborators and topics and B) limits university intervention when their research faces criticism.\[5\]\[6\]

Consistent with research freedom, MIT has not previously banned research sponsors or ended research contracts except when required by U.S. law. For example, when many MIT faculty said that MIT should sever all ties with the Saudi kingdom after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, MIT did not terminate any Saudi-affiliated research contracts.\[5\]  MIT has similarly rejected calls to stop faculty research contracts with fossil fuel industry partners.

(Update: As I have learned since writing this post, MIT did not renew its direct partnership with Saudi Aramco in 2020, though it retained existing faculty research contracts. [Here is a write-up](https://fnl.mit.edu/may-june-2020/on-the-risks-and-benefits-of-new-international-engagements/) on how that decision was reached through MIT's elevated risk-review process.)

MIT’s faculty and administration have taken related public positions favoring “research openness,” including research in host countries criticized for human rights concerns like Russia and China.\[5\]\[6\] These positions assert that science requires open collaboration even during foreign policy conflicts. MIT recently reaffirmed its position on openness as Congress considered new limits on U.S.-China research collaboration.\[7\]

SAGE argues that research freedom was disregarded in February 2022, when MIT terminated a $100M/year collaboration agreement with Russia’s Skoltech after the Russian military invaded Ukraine.\[1\]\[8\] However, as a broad university-level partnership between MIT and Skoltech, it did not implicate faculty research freedom as SAGE’s demands do.\[8\] MIT continues to allow faculty to work with Russian sponsors and collaborators, although [U.S. State Department sanctions](https://www.state.gov/imposing-additional-costs-on-russia-for-its-continued-war-against-ukraine/) now restrict research collaborations with many Russian institutions, including Skoltech.\[9\]

The Saudi and Skoltech decisions show MIT's inflexible position on faculty research freedom, even when human rights concerns are broadly held in the MIT community. MIT exercises more discretion over non-research funding, like direct partnerships and gifts. But unless required by U.S. law or foreign policy, MIT seems unlikely to create a tailored ban on one faculty research sponsor.

**Other policy limits on military-sponsored campus research**

MIT’s existing rules for campus research limit how military-sponsored research can be conducted, but not the collaborators or subjects faculty can choose. Research projects:

* must be publishable without restriction.
* cannot require students to work on classified topics.
* cannot exclude researchers by country of origin.\[10\]

These rules practically limit the military projects that can happen on campus. For instance, no research project could be kept secret from anyone else at MIT. (See \[11\] for reasons that MIT has opted to limit military research through conduct restrictions.)

**Why ""elevated risk review"" wouldn't resolve the stated demands**  
(Partially addressing an insightful [comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1cookbg/new_sally_email/l3fml9t/) from last week)

For sponsors in some countries, MIT applies an “elevated-risk project review” to faculty research proposals when the content could present risks to human rights, U.S. national security, or U.S. economic competitiveness.\[12\] These reviews involve both an MIT-wide faculty committee and senior administrators. They can result in project modifications, contract changes, or a refusal of MIT support.\[4\]\[12\] Elevated-risk reviews are not done for approved research contracts because “the bar for administrative intervention to terminate such projects should be set very high.”\[4\]

There are at least three apparent reasons risk review would not satisfy the demands. First, an impartial review without prejudgment is something SAGE has said it cannot accept. Second, expanding risk reviews would limit faculty research freedom, so MIT would normally involve faculty in a decision that affects them. Considering faculty opinions violates SAGE's demand that changes happen immediately. Third, SAGE seeks a content-independent ban on contracts with IMoD, which does not fit a review process primarily used for content-specific risks.

**Addendum: On ""robotic swarms"" research at MIT**

As I have stressed, the demands listed by SAGE do not seek to end any particular project, only to sever two projects from their sponsor. However, their public statements focus intensively on a research project on ""autonomous robotic swarms,"" so it would seem they have concerns about risks of harm following this project. As someone who doesn't do any work in this area, the name does give off some ""Black Mirror"" vibes.

But I try not to reason from vibes. After reading more, I find it hard to distinguish the title or outputs of the project from at least a half-dozen other MIT projects on UAV swarms and distributed control. The papers from these projects cite broad commercial and military applications. Unclassified projects on this topic have been ongoing at MIT for at least ten years, in several departments, with a lot of different sponsors.

Given that all these projects are basic research under MIT's rules, i.e. openly published and nonproprietary, I have yet to see an objection to the one IMoD project that wouldn't apply to many other UAV projects not funded by IMoD. It's also important that the SAGE remedy—replacing funding with other funding—would not affect the outcomes or consequences of the project. So this doubly affirms that the SAGE demands address only their concerns about the sponsor, not any project-specific consequences for human rights.

I am taking the late exams, so I have around 2 weeks to study. I took Calc BC, and plan on taking lit, gov, and microecon. I am definitely taking lit to try to avoid the FEE, but I'm unsure about gov and econ. My gov teacher didn't teach us very much, so it will take a lot of studying, and similar for econ. The benefit I see is 9 units of unrestricted elective credit, but what does that actually do/mean and is it useful? I'm planning on studying 6-3 with a minor in 15-3. Could unrestricted elective credit make my courseload a little easier for some semesters?

Also, I'm trying to understand what a general example roadmap looks like for 6-3 with 15-3 minor. I found one for 6-3, but it doesn't list any of the other classes/GIRs/electives/whatever else. Would the minor take up electives spots, or could any of them classify as GIRs? If anyone could explain a general roadmap for me, that would mean a ton!

This is not the purpose of the GSU - the GSU is meant to advocate with the MIT administration for material things that benefit *all* grad students equally - such as salary, housing cost, vacation, etc.

I get the impression that certain GSU officers are treating the GSU funding as a personal ""slush fund"".

It is especially problematic because *many* people will feel too intimidated to speak up against this, for fear of attracting harassment. This is no idle fear - many people have already been harassed.

Again, I think that GSU should not be involved with this. It is clearly discriminatory against grad students who disagree, such as Israeli or Jewish students, and against people who would rather just steer clear of the conflict.

If people want to join or support protests, that's 100% fine with me. Just do it through a different organization that doesn't purport to represent all MIT grad students.

UPDATE - As people have pointed out in the comments, the GSU is apparently now involved in at least 2 lawsuits brought by grad students for discrimination related to the Palestine issue. Links:

Full Text:

Dear members of the MIT community,

At my direction, very early this morning, the encampment on Kresge lawn was cleared. The individuals present in the encampment at the time were given four separate warnings, in person, that they should depart or face arrest. The 10 who remained did not resist arrest and were peacefully escorted from the encampment by MIT police officers and taken off campus for booking. 

I write now because this is an unprecedented situation for our community, and you deserve a clear explanation of how we arrived at this moment.

But let me start by emphasizing that, as president, my responsibility is to the whole community: to make sure that the campus is physically safe and functioning for everyone, that our shared spaces and resources are available for everyone, and that everyone feels free to express their views and do the work they came here to do. As you will see, in numerous ways, the presence of the encampment increasingly made it impossible to meet all these obligations. 

A timeline of key events

Here’s a quick timeline, familiar from my past notes to you:

The encampment began on Sunday, April 21, in violation of clear Institute guidelines well known to the student organizers. It slowly grew. Though it was peaceful, its presence generated controversy, including persistent calls from some of you that we shut it down. While we asked the students repeatedly to leave the site, we chose for a time not to interfere, in part out of respect for the Institute’s foundational principles of free expression.
 
Last Friday, May 3, we were able to contain a significant rally and counter demonstration through a very extensive coordinated effort, including with the City of Cambridge, which shut down Mass. Avenue. Among other measures, we set up high temporary fencing around the encampment to help maintain separation between the groups. This event drew several hundred people from outside MIT in support of each side.
 
On Monday, May 6, judging that we could not sustain the extraordinary level of effort required to keep the encampment and the campus community safe, we directed the encamped students to leave the site voluntarily or face clear disciplinary consequences. Some left. Some stayed inside, while others chose to step just outside the camp and protest. Some chose to invite to the encampment large numbers of individuals from outside MIT, including dozens of minors, who arrived in response to social media posts.

Late that afternoon, aided by people from outside MIT, many of the encampment students breached and forcibly knocked down the safety fencing and demolished most of it, on their way to reestablishing the camp. In that moment, the peaceful nature of the encampment shifted. Disciplinary measures were not sufficient to end it nor to deter students from quickly reestablishing it.
 
Wednesday, May 8, was marked by a series of escalating provocations. In the morning, pro-Palestinian supporters physically blocked the entrance and exit to the Stata Center garage though they eventually dispersed. Later, after taking down Israeli and American flags that had been hung by counter protestors, some individuals defaced Israeli flags with red handprints, in the presence of Israeli students and faculty. Several pro-Israel supporters then entered the camp to confront and shout at the protestors. Throughout, the opposing groups grew in numbers. With so many opposing individuals in close quarters, tensions ran very high. The day ended with more suspensions – and a rally by the pro-Palestinian students.
 
Thursday, May 9, pro-Palestinian students again blocked the mouth of the Stata garage, preventing community members from entering and exiting to go about their business, and requiring that Vassar Street be shut down. This time, they refused directions from the police to leave and allow passage of cars. Their action therefore resulted in nine arrests. 
Sustained effort to reach a resolution through dialogue

As we all, know, the current conflict on campus stretches far beyond MIT. From the beginning, we have watched with great concern what has happened on other campuses. We have been determined to avoid violence, and I have been strongly opposed to using the threat of arrest to resolve a situation that should be mediated by discourse. 

We tried every path we could to find a way out through dialogue. In various combinations, senior administrative leaders and faculty officers met with the protesters many times over almost two weeks. This sustained team effort benefited from the involvement of at least a dozen faculty members and alumni who have been supporting and advising the protestors, and, in the final stages, a professional mediator who was meeting with the students.

Reaching a solution hinged on our ability to meet the students’ primary demand, which we could not do in a well-principled way that respected the academic freedom of our faculty. Yet though all of us working with the students were hopeful, the students would not yield on their original demand, and negotiation did not succeed. 

Irresolvable tensions, and a tipping point

And thus we arrived at this morning’s police action – our last resort.

For members of our community who may remember or even have participated in past protests, at MIT or elsewhere: This situation is fundamentally different. Why? Because this is not one group in conflict with the administration. It is two groups in conflict, in part through us, with each other.

The encampment had become a symbol for both sides. For those supporting the pro-Palestinian cause, it symbolized a moral commitment that trumped all other considerations, because of the immense suffering in Gaza. For the pro-Israel side, the encampment – at the center of the campus where they are trying to receive an education and conduct research – delivered a constant assertion, through its signs and chants, that those who believe that Israel has a right to exist are unwelcome at MIT. 

As a result, the encampment became a flashpoint. MIT sits at the center of a major metropolitan area that features a large population of college-aged students. Our campus is easy to reach and wide open. 

The escalation of the last few days, involving outside threats from individuals and groups from both sides, has been a tipping point. It was not heading in a direction anyone could call peaceful. And the cost and disruption for the community overall made the situation increasingly untenable. We did not believe we could responsibly allow the encampment to persist.

The actions we've taken, gradually stepped up over time, have been commensurate with the risk we are in a position to see. We did not take this step suddenly. We offered warnings. We telegraphed clearly what was coming. At each point, the students made their own choices. And finally, choosing among several bad options, we chose the path we followed this morning – where each student again had a choice. I do not expect everyone to agree with our reasoning or our decision, but I hope it helps to see how we got there.

Finally: Our actions today had nothing to do with the specific viewpoints of the students in the encampment. We acted in response to their actions. There are countless highly effective ways for all of us to express ourselves that neither disrupt the functioning of the Institute nor create a magnet for external protestors. As the ad hoc Committee on Academic Freedom and Campus Expression recently observed, “while freedom of expression protects the ability of community members to express their views about the current situation in the Middle East, it does not protect the continued use of a shared Institute resource in violation of long-established rules.”

*  *  *

Our community includes people who lost friends and family to the brutal terror attack of October 7, and people with friends and family currently in mortal danger in Rafah. It includes individuals whose families have struggled for years under the strictures imposed on Gaza, and at least one faculty member – an alumnus who has made his home at MIT for more than 70 years – who lost his whole family to the Holocaust. And of course, MIT includes people who hold a spectrum of views beyond those expressed by the encampment and by its fiercest opponents.

We all have a stake in this community. And we all have an interest in being treated with decency and respect for our humanity. That interest comes with a responsibility to offer each other the same consideration. We must find a way to work through this situation together; I pledge to work on that with anyone who will join me.

I have no illusions that today’s action will bring an end to the conflict here, as the war continues to rage in the Middle East. But I had no choice but to remove such a high-risk flashpoint at the very center of our campus.

Sincerely,

Sally Kornbluth"

"The list of supposed ""IDF funding"" at MIT is a sham",https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1cnun1n/the_list_of_supposed_idf_funding_at_mit_is_a_sham/,368,165,2024-05-09 11:10:33,"As most of you know, a list of supposed IDF funding was circulated to the MIT community, naming PIs. What you may not know is that the PIs on that list are getting harassing phone calls, as are *their students*. (Even the ones whose PI's projects are expired.) A representative of MIT Coalition for Palestine also e-mailed those students directly, telling them to ""take the action you feel is appropriate"" and suggesting that they ""reject this funding.""

However, the list itself is a total sham. I know for a fact that one of the alleged expired projects wasn't a project at all. It was the salary of an Israeli postdoc with a fellowship. This postdoc wanted to work on the existing project at MIT (one with zero military application, BTW), got a fellowship from the Israeli MOD, and was allowed to join the project by the PI because he was free to the PI.

That is one of the fourteen projects. I suspect that most, if not all, are funding for Israeli postdocs and students. In general, there seems to be a misconception at work here. No military—not the U.S. military, not the IDF—funds weapon research at universities. They fund basic research, research that could maybe one day have an application. Anything with any immediate military application at all happens in military labs. But actually, the main goal of these kinds of fellowships is workforce development: training people who could work in military labs or who could become professors who train people who could work in military labs.

And no, it's not simple to just move them onto another project. The whole point of a fellowship is that it makes you attractive to prospective PIs because you're funding yourself. PIs don't have huge pots of unspent funding in their coffers, and funded positions are orders of magnitude more competitive (meaning they can get much better students/postdocs).

Maybe the person who made and circulated that list should have done some research before accusing MIT professors and students of enabling genocide.

Edit: To clarify, I can only speak about one project for a fact because I have personal knowledge of it. But almost all of the funding levels are too small to be real projects, including the active ones. This suggests they are mostly fellowships. 

The person who compiled the list has access to all of the detailed budget justifications that would clarify the nature of the funding, but chose not to release that information. Releasing a list of names and numbers with no other information is irresponsible at least and dangerous at worst."

Dear members of the MIT community,
  
The war in the Middle East continues to cause anguish and conflict here at MIT.  Some have expressed their views through the encampment on the Kresge lawn. My team and I, as well as many faculty members, have engaged in extensive conversation with these students and have not interfered as they have continued their protest. However, given developments over the past several days, I must now take action to bring closure to a situation that has disrupted our campus for more than two weeks.    
My sense of urgency comes from an increasing concern for the safety of our community. I know many of you feel strongly that the encampment should be allowed to continue indefinitely – that the protest is simply a peaceful exercise of the right to free expression, and that normal rules around campus conduct shouldn’t apply in the face of such tragic loss of life in Gaza.    
But I am responsible for this community. Without our 24-hour staffing, students sleeping outside overnight in tents would be vulnerable. And no matter how peaceful the students’ behavior may be, unilaterally taking over a central portion of our campus for one side of a hotly disputed issue and precluding use by other members of our community is not right. This situation is inherently highly unstable.  
What’s more, the threat of outside interference and potential violence is not theoretical, it is real: We have all seen circumstances around encampments at some peer institutions degenerate into chaos. As recently as this weekend, we were presented with firm evidence of outside interference on US campuses, including widely disseminated literature that advocates escalation, with very clear instructions and suggested means, including vandalism.  
Our own campus has seen a variety of actions involving people from outside MIT, including a series of rallies organized by people who have no MIT affiliation. An outside group is planning another campus disruption here this afternoon.  
Many of you have sent me messages noting that the two large rallies – which brought many people from outside MIT to campus last Friday and shut down Massachusetts Avenue – occurred peacefully. But this apparent equilibrium required extraordinary preparation and enormous effort by hundreds of staff, faculty, and police, including, as the rallies were winding down, expert work by MIT Police to defuse several tense confrontations.  
In short, this prolonged use of MIT property as a venue for protest, without permission, especially on an issue with such sharp disagreement, is no longer safely sustainable. I note that the faculty-led Committee on Academic Freedom and Campus Expression (CAFCE) recently concluded that these actions, a form of civil disobedience, carry consequences.  
We have directed students to leave the encampment peacefully by 2:30 p.m. today. We’ve provided them with a letter from Chancellor Nobles that gives as much clarity as possible about the choices they have, and the pathways associated with each of these choices. You can read this information below my signature.  
I hoped these measures could be avoided through our efforts to engage the students in serious good-faith discussion. But recent events, and my responsibility to ensure the physical safety of our community, oblige us to act now.  
MIT can and should continue to be a place where we can discuss and seek to address contentious issues. But we are also a community of doers—of people with the skills and drive to make the world better. And no matter our political beliefs or our position on this war, we can all recognize the immense suffering unfolding in Gaza. I believe our best contribution would be to focus our collective efforts on projects that bring MIT’s expertise to bear on the humanitarian crisis in the region. I’ve begun discussing this idea with faculty leaders.  

Sincerely,  
Sally Kornbluth  
  
Excerpt from Chancellor Melissa Nobles' letter to students involved in the encampment   
“Our goal is to bring the encampment to a peaceful end. Below are the choices you have:  
I. For those who leave the encampment voluntarily by 2:30 pm:  
1.	If you have not been sanctioned by the COD [Committee on Discipline] and do not have any pending COD cases related to events since October 7, and you have not contributed significantly as a leader or organizer of the encampment, this letter serves as a written warning. You must swipe your ID as you leave the encampment, and the written warning, together with the time stamp from your exit swipe showing you departed by 2:30 pm, will be kept on file with MIT. A written warning means you are on notice that any further violation of MIT policies and rules could lead to a more severe sanction. The written warning will be the only disciplinary action for participating in the encampment.  
2.	If you have been sanctioned by the COD or have a pending COD case related to events since October 7, or have contributed significantly as a leader or organizer of the encampment, you will be referred to the COD, but your voluntary departure from the encampment by 2:30 pm today will be a significant mitigating factor when the COD reviews your case. You must swipe your ID as you leave the encampment, and we will keep on file the time stamp from your exit swipe showing you departed by 2:30 pm.  
II. For those who do not leave the encampment voluntarily by 2:30 pm:  
1.	If you have not been sanctioned by the COD and do not have any pending COD cases related to events since October 7, but choose to stay in the encampment past the deadline, you will be placed on an immediate interim academic suspension lasting at least through Institute commencement activities, and you will be referred to the COD. This means you will be prohibited from participating in any academic activities – including classes, exams, or research – for the remainder of the semester. You will also be prohibited from participating in commencement activities or any co-curricular activities. During the period of your interim academic suspension, you will be permitted to reside in your assigned residence hall through the end of the semester, use your meal plan at MIT dining halls, and utilize services at MIT Health. Continued additional protests or disruptions that are not authorized will be considered an aggravating factor in the COD review of your case.  
2.	If you either have been sanctioned by the COD or have a pending COD case related to events since October 7, but choose to stay in the encampment past the deadline, you will be placed on an immediate interim full suspension lasting at least through Institute commencement activities, and you will be referred to the COD. This means you will be prohibited from participating in any academic activities – including classes, exams, or research – for the remainder of the semester. You will also be prohibited from participating in commencement activities or any cocurricular activities. You will also not be permitted to reside in your assigned residence hall or use MIT dining halls. You must leave campus immediately, but you will continue to have access to services at MIT Health. Continued additional protests or disruptions that are not authorized will be considered an aggravating factor in the COD review of your case.”"

I applied to U Penn's MCIT program but was rejected, likely due to lacking any rigorous college level math courses, and no GMAT/GRE.

My question here is, do you think the SDM certificate would be worthwhile for my goals above? Obviously the Masters program would be better, but the lower cost, shorter time, and brand recognition of MIT are all very appealing to me.

* Better food and weather
* Dorms are tight-knit but normal

* Could opt for coterm
* Opportunities to take humanities classes in a broad range of fields

**Stanford cons**

* Duck syndrome
* Culture seems somewhat pre-professional and less focused on learning
* Strong sports culture
* Clubs can be exclusive

**MIT pros**

* Unparalleled undergrad research and academic culture
* Probably the most collaborative school in the country
* Could study abroad during IAP
* Meritocratic admissions translates to everyone being extremely smart

**MIT cons**

* Grind culture + everyone is constantly stressed due to class rigor
* People care less about the humanities, and humanities courses are weaker overall
* Significant greek life
* Noticeable portion of quirky, socially awkward dorms/people
* Math/cs may be highly competitive

The requirement is listed as getting 3 A's and 1 B where two of the classes are in one area and the other two classes need to be from two other areas. At the EECS visit day, there weren't many details given out and in particular on how challenging the requirement is. Some students said the requirement was hard though manageable but I didn't get specifics. I am particularly interested in knowing as my undergrad and masters are not in electrical engineering. I feel very comfortable with the research but not as sure about how the classes will go. I am always excited to learn but simply don't have the background for many of the classes. The grad students hinted at a set classes to take for ""easier A's"" but I am not sure how applicable this is to any students who are coming from other backgrounds (it would be helpful if anyone could share which classes these may be through PM).

I am a recent ECE/physics undergrad admit who is still choosing btw Princeton and MIT. I was so deadset on MIT until CPW.

This is sort of weird bc I ultimately left CPW rly happy + excited and had made an awesome little friend group already. But after having some time to mull it over, the vibes and intimidation of MIT r still getting to me.

I hated the campus (still after two visits) and dorms were all awful, and I feel like I will never fit into the turbo nerd culture at MIT. I liked how everyone was so openly unique and “quirky”, but I felt way too much like a normie  and super dumb +unprepared compared to other ppl o.0
I full on couldn’t have a conversation w my friends sometimes bc I had no idea wth they were talking abt—this scared me and made me feel like shit

Ultimately, IK later down the line I want to go to MIT/Stanford for grad school bc I will be in STEM. So I’d rather spend my undergrad somewhere else, and I also am super enticed by the idea of being on a traditional campus where there is a huge mix of interests (rather than just everyone STEM and almost everyone CS lol)
But then again, maybe this reasoning is just coping bc I don’t like the idea of saying no to MIT

So my main concerns r these:

1.) Does the ECE dept tend to encourage current undergrads to seek grad school elsewhere, or do they favor MIT undergrads for grad programs?

2.) Are the opportunities/resources provided by MIT rly that incomparable to other schools? 

3.) Did anyone else hate the vibes of the school and still went? If so, how has your experience been so far and do you regret ur decision?

4.) How do you all feel abt the campus culture as a whole? 

If any of u guys just rly love MIT and think I am an idiot to not go or vice versa, pls lmk. Ik I’m still super young and therefore dumb, so I don’t want to make such a major a decision based off of “my heart” (which is telling me to go to Pton) "

i'm not sure if there's anyone here who's familiar with both harvard math 55 and MIT's classes, but why is math 55 is hyped up as super difficult when 18.701+702+100B is seen as pretty standard and has nowhere near the same reputation? is the only reason because it's 3 classes vs 2, or am i missing something?"

Factors I’m weighing are what the culture is like, how good, accessible, and helpful the professors are, what kind of resources are available, what kind of research the departments are doing/how easy it is to get involved in that research as an undergrad, and how the general undergrad experience at each is (dorms, food, community, extracurricular activities, etc).

I am considering two schools right now, one of which is MIT. The other school is similarly competitive for engineering but has better humanities options.

I know that in college, I'd like to spend a significant portion of my time in the HASS fields, so I was drawn to 21E. In order to decide whether I should attend MIT, I have the following questions:

\- Is 21E taken seriously at MIT? Is there a perception that 21E majors ""can't hack it"" in the pure STEM fields?

\- How big is a 21E joint-degree relative to a double major or a major/minor? I may end up majoring 6-3 and minoring in CMS or 24-1. How different would this be from 21E?

\- Is putting a 21E major on my resume going to look worse than a pure CS&E major when applying for internships / jobs? If so, how much?

my main interests are mathematical physics, condensed matter physics, theoretical particle physics, & QFT. current options are stanford, harvard, and MIT.

I'm lost on which to pick. Here are things important to me:

1. research opportunities (preferably theoretical not experimental which is difficult) being readily accessible to undergrad (i know about UROP but this would have to do w/ cold-emailing profs in the grad department, and idk how accessible that is). lowkey this is more of a subsection of math than it is a subsection of physics
2. course flexibility (i like taking stuff i want to learn about rather than having rigid requirements. don't really want to take multi again as i took it multiple years ago so the ASE is kind of annoying but ig I'll try to pass out?)
3. non monolithic stem culture and general intellectualism regarding humanities. something I'm a bit worried about w regards to MIT because i like being surrounded by people interested in a variety of diff areas
4. balance. tbh i am a party/music person and would not consider myself studious. I'm an ADHD person who likes hyperfixating on certain areas rather than someone who enjoys adhering to rigidity
5. less important but also something i want to consider, diversity. I'm a low-income woman going into stem and i'd love to find people that are like me but the above factors are much more important than this

- Where do people usually eat during the weekends?

- Is there a building with usable showers? Unfortunately I joined an apartment where the previous and current occupant refuses to clean anything and relies on the (monthly?

Don't get me wrong - I'm super happy that I got into MIT and was able to get the chance to go there (still numb from the fact that I even got in). But every time I go on like r/collegeresults or even like the MIT Discord there's this feeling of inferiority/imposter syndrome. Like what I have in my resume is nothing to other admits (like they have IMO medals while I'm just getting through my Calculus class) or even rejects/waitlisted people. Additionally, there was this kid who went to my school and also applied to MIT and got rejected, and started talking behind my back that there was no way I got in and he's lost faith in the admissions process - and I'm scared that he's right. 

I'm also just stressed overall because of the huge jump. I come from a public school who hasn't seen a lot of Ivy League admittance (I was the second MIT admit in 10 years) and I'm just super scared that I'm not prepared for college academically and that I'm not going to able to make the most out of the opportunities there.

i have heard from some people that in higher levels of pure math classes, mit's math department tends to have some discrimination against females? or at least it's hard for girls to find people to work with for psets especially in upper division classes. is this true? i love hard classes but i'm worried that it'll just be a hostile environment. 

also, what kind of student culture is on campus? are people really competitive with each other? like is there sabotage or anything? i really want to be somewhere that focuses on collaboration (and i guess mutual suffering lol) so i was just wondering what y'all think of mit's campus culture.

especially within the math department, is there a lot of competition for conferences, internships, jobs, grades, etc.? compared to caltech, is there less individual focus and support (especially since caltech is so small)? and if this is a possible question to answer, what do you think is the biggest difference between mit and caltech?

what aspects of the MIT experience make it conducive for this exploration? what aspects of it don't? any particular experiences with the pure math dept? i also get that there are options within course 18 itself, some of which are probably more ""branched out"" and flexible than others.

recently, I have been reviewing math from college. I haven't gone to MIT, but I am using MIT OCW to do this. I am doing this in my free time. I have a full time job as a machine learning engineer. I have already went through 18.01 (Single Variable Calculus), 18.02 (Multi Variable Calculus) and 18.06 (Linear Algebra).

Now I am about to pick a course to review my probability (and potentially statistics) knowledge. I can't really decide between two courses: 18.440 (Probability and Random Variables) and 18.05 (Introduction to Probability and Statistics).

**In my studies, I am focused on practical applications of math.** I don't mind reading proofs of a few really fundamental theorems, but that's about it; I'd like concepts explained through examples.

That being said, which course would you recommend to me? By looking at [https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/), it seems that 18.05 is the requirements list to all but 6-14 (Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science), so I'm leaning towards taking 18.05."

storing Chemicals On-Campus,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1bbhm1n/storing_chemicals_oncampus/,0,15,2024-03-10 18:44:41,"Hi, to start, I don't attend MIT and probably won't end up applying - I'm in high school. I'm writing this as I'm trying to figure out whether it's common practice for colleges (with labs) to be able to / have the capacity to store chemicals brought-in by students. It's certainly 'pushing the boundaries' of things - a part of the reason why I'm putting this on r/mit \- but I was hoping to bring in instruments that work based off rubidium and cesium (frequency standards), though to my understanding, having reactive chemicals in one's dorm is a bit of a no-no (huh, who would've wondered). Any thoughts on doing this at MIT (or generally any university)?

To provide a bit of context, I did try emailing a few dorm management teams at universities on what their policies may look like on this, but no dice (as in, they didn't respond; fair enough). Looking online, I can't find much on this, though I would really like to figure out if any general guidelines exist on this -or any personal experience if it varies college to college.

But I would like to know what exact levels you have to go through

So far I have referred to  [MIT Integration Bee](https://math.mit.edu/~yyao1/integrationbee.html) website but I dont get it

I have also tried to ask from copilot(since chatGPT dont know anything about it) but still unsatisfied.

Let me tell you what I think happens:  
Participants are provided with 20 questions and the top 16 students are selected for regular season in which 4 students integrate against each other and the fastest one advances to final playoffs. A total of 8(out of 16) students make it to the playoffs.

Then in finals, the 8students go against in pairs(1v1) and then the winner is decided.

This is what I have been able to gather so far(which is probably wrong).

I would appreciate if someone can more briefly explain the whole process like how exactly do they measure which contestant has passed the round. Is it the time taken or some other factor?

Also if only 1 of 4 students can go to finals and there are 16 total in regular season, shouldn't there be 4 students in the final playoffs?  
I was unable to find any information on YouTube and would be owed to anyone who can help me further on this.

It's always bothered me to this day, and I'm wondering if anyone else had a similar experience.

I had a midterm at Walker Memorial, in that big gym room at the top. I finished a bit early and left the testing center.  I was standing in the lobby-ish area on the top floor of Walker, when somehow, I got engaged in conversation with an older man who had just been sitting there. He wasn't student aged and looked more like a professor on the younger side (maybe 40's and white).  I don't recall knowing him from anywhere, and I don't think I ever saw him again.

I'm not the kind to initiate conversation, so I think he started the conversation up. I don't remember exactly what the conversation was, other than I got some really creepy vibes from him. Like, the ""I'm in danger"" kind of vibes. I politely backed myself out of the conversation as soon as I could (it lasted for a while, maybe 5-10 minutes), but before I left, he insisted that I take a CD with me.

It was a CD in a clear case without a label on it. I took it to avoid confrontation and promptly left, and to ensure I wasn't followed I took the bus around campus a few times before heading to the student center, where I threw the CD out. I was kind of afraid of what was on it. My mind thought it might have been something illegal, or some kind of virus, or... I don't know. He didn't seem like the kind of person that would just hand me a mixtape (And no music was discussed)

Has anyone ever had a similar experience...? I know this was over 10 years ago now, but every once in a while I think back to that day and wonder what the heck that was about.

Why are dining hall meals so expensive?,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/1agrg08/why_are_dining_hall_meals_so_expensive/,47,15,2024-02-02 01:18:32,"Even the 21 meal/week plan costs an average of $10.40/meal, and there is no way everyone eats every meal at the dining hall. A more representative cost is probably something like the Block 90 plan which is $17.50/meal. This is more than it would cost to eat out (and get better food too!).

What is contributing to that cost? I live in a cook-for-myself dorm and spend about $50-$60/week on food. So, the cost of the actual food is something like $3/meal, maybe a bit more for dinner. Where does the other $14.50+ go?

It doesn't seem to be staff pay. Looking at [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/MIT-Retail-and-Food-Services-Salaries-EI_IE2889.0,3_DEPT1020.htm), MIT seems to be paying its workers about $50k per year. This costs them maybe $70k/worker what with taxes and other costs not included in payroll. I estimate that (1) there are about 6 staff/dining hall * 6 dining halls = 36 staff and (2) that MIT students eat about 10 meals/student/week * 32 weeks of classes * 1/2 of students * 4,500 undergrads =  720,000 meals per year in the dining halls. Combined, this would add $70k * 36 / 720000 = $3.5 to the cost of the meal.

So, in total my estimate is that the meals would cost ~$6.50. What makes them cost so much more? Am I missing some other cost? Are my numbers just horribly off?"

I know that MIT Checklist is one of the main ways to see for any degree how you close our to completion (and what courses are filling out what requirement), but was wondering if this is actually what the MIT Graduation Staff look at to verify if someone has fulfilled all the requirements and is eligible to recieve a degree. 

I ask this in particular because I've notice that sometimes the Checklist doesn't follow my degree guidelines at times (e.g taking a course doesn't fill the expected box it should, although the degree requirements as shown on [eecs.mit.edu](https://eecs.mit.edu) says that it will). Maybe there's something internal that the degree staff use to check these requirements, or is this just an inadverent glitch in the Checklist and is it actually what is used to verify whether someone has completed their degree requirements?

I'm concerned about my lack of undergrad research experience. Instead of UROPing in ML, I spent my summers doing irrelevant SWE internships and dedicated my free time to sports and clubs. Now, I regret not getting involved in any ML research in the last few years.

Do any of you good folks have advice on how to gain some actual ML experience so I can confidently reach out to professors for this fall? 

I'm open to all types of opportunities, whether it be ML internships or research positions. I've been applying to industry ML internships since last fall but have had very little luck so far in getting responses. To be expected with my dire lack of experience? 😭

# I'm weighing experience MUCH MUCH more than pay. I don't care if I get paid below minimum wage. Right now I'm so concerned that no labs will want me as their MEng.

The title is basically my question. I'm an incoming frosh intending to major in Course 2 ( open to other experiences apart from MechE! ), and I was wondering what experiences you've had such as through UROP,  MITLL, or at a company perhaps ( these are examples, anything else would be greatly appreciated ). A second question would be what you did to get these opportunities, how did you build your resume or what skills do you believe helped you the most ( an example resume would be great! ).

how to sell-less-out,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/19f19j0/how_to_selllessout/,181,26,2024-01-25 04:49:01,"I'm your average course 6. I came into MIT bright-eyed and bushy tail, thinking I'll go into CS+bio research and help so many people. 1 semester after, I just want to graduate and get a job. I like CS, but if given the choice to study it any more beyond a bachelors I'd beeline the other way.

Lately, I've been thinking about what if I unknowingly lied in my application. I mean I never directly mentioned that I ""loved"" CS; I liked using CS to help other people, teaching it, solving medical problems, etc. Or did MIT just change me so much in the span of a couple months, where I've become a ""sellout"". I'm FLI but financial stability isn't an excuse when other FLIs are actually passionate about what they study.

I'm passionate about making money. There I said it. Money means being able to hang out with friends at nice places, not feeling guilty about buying food, traveling because I've never been out of the country, and buying my parents nice things that they never had and so that they can finally rest easy.

I don't like being money-driven. I want to be passionate about CS. I feel like I am doing MIT wrong."

If it's such a great course, it should be apparent from the description, class website, or word of mouth.

But, that doesn't answer why it's advertised so aggressively. Are there donor dollars relying on bums in seats? A new administrator trying to expand their demense? Does MIT think its students are evil? After all they do talk about selling out (their soul) to quant. or MAMAA. Is this something to do with the recent plagiarism scandal? Why is this the only class being shoved down our throats?"

any people here greatly benefit from the saunas? like i said, im grateful and they provide me with an incredible benefit to my overall well being on many levels.  is there any shared desire to want to surface this appreciation to the administration such that they take an improvement to saunas into consideration? perhaps there is also a lot to be said about improving the saunas, adding steam room, cold soaks, float tanks, etc. in an effort to improve variety of methods that promote overall wellness and a sense of calm in such a charged place such as mit.

what are your thoughts? personally, i'd love to see a complete revamping of the saunas to include steam room, cold plunges, whirlpool/jacuzzi, etc. for some these may seem like luxuries, but they truly do provide mental health benefits and help promote calmness thus an avenue for justification of the spending....in my opinion of course.

Personally, i think such an effort would be most effective if coordinated by students.... ideally, maybe some students have befriended a notable alum or donor at the gym who could help shepeard this forward.... in some way -- not relying on said notable alum or donor to pay for it, since ideally in my mind mit should fund and maintain this centrally given the important health benefits provided to students. it's just having certain people/names attached to things help and could help if such an effort like this is actually implemented somehow.....im trying to think strategically here ;)

of note -- i myself cannot lead such an effort, but i sure hope that if students enjoy and benefit from the sauna you form a group together and make your voices heard :)

Call for new Mods,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/191gfua/call_for_new_mods/,139,38,2024-01-08 08:25:21,"Hey all,

Should have opened a call for mods ages ago, but better late than never :) 

As a quick background, moderation on this subreddit has traditionally been very simple -- really it's culling one or two admissions posts a week at _best_. (maybe a few extra during the admissions deadline) While I don't comment much on reddit, I do lurk often and quietly clean up the front page once every few days.

Given the recent increase in bot-related and political spam (thanks GPT4...), it does make sense to expand the moderation team. So if you've been chomping at the bit to shake things up here, now's your chance. I've pruned off all the other inactive mods to give us a fresh start.

Having watched this subreddit for several years now, I think I have two major desires:

1. I'm personally rather interested in increasing diversity of thought here. I'd like to add at least three more mods, and looking for a healthy mix of undergraduate, graduate, faculty, and staff. I think the undergraduate voice is too dominant here, and I'd love to make this subreddit generally useful for the _whole_ community.

2. Given the low volume of posts and the relatively small community site, I'm also particularly interested in finding folks who want to expand and grow the subreddit. It's tragic that /r/harvard is 1.5x bigger than us. Post fliers in the infinite? Send unsolicited dormspam? Put a banner across the great dome? Run weekly events in the subreddit? idc, just make this a place worth moderating.

Anyways, if the above floats your boat, here's a link to the [Application Google Form](https://forms.gle/8BXcF9fRU598EG1s9). I'll leave the form up for a bit -- we'll consider this our IAP 2024 activity :)"

I really like the classes I've taken so far, but looking at internships/long term jobs I'm wondering if it was a mistake to start out really broad. I'm worried that at the end of my degree, I'll know a little about every field but not know enough/be an expert in any of them.

For people who work in robotics, who are course 2A or 16-ENG, or just generally have advice- did you specialize in one thing in college and then diversify your skills later? Would it be better if I majored in electrical engineering and then broadened my knowledge down the line?

He's also a really good professor based on my impression of having watched half a lecture.

I obviously plan on watching BOTH of these series because it seems like both of these professors are VERY knowledgeable in their respective field and I want to learn more about the intuition behind LinAlg and MVC for ML/DL. But with that being said, is there a major difference to note between the two courses, and is there a clear one that is ""less hard"" that I should first start with?

I'm currently diving into MIT's OCW course 6.041 - Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability. This is a part of my journey to deepen my understanding of Deep Learning and its foundational principles.

I'm reaching out to this knowledgeable community for two main reasons:

1. **Study Partners:** I'm eager to connect with anyone who has taken or is currently enrolled in this course. Discussing complex math problems and course materials would be incredibly beneficial. If you're interested in forming a study group or just having occasional discussions, I'd be thrilled to collaborate.
2. **Course Insights:** If you've completed this course, I'd love to hear your experiences and any advice you might have. What were the challenging aspects? Are there any resources that you found particularly helpful? Your insights could greatly enhance my learning experience.

**A bit about me:** I completed my undergrad in CS in 2013 and have since accumulated a decade of experience in the software industry. Currently, I'm on a career break to upskill in AI, pursuing an online graduate program from Stanford University. Based in Bengaluru, my timezone is GMT +5:30.

Has anyone at MIT ever actually called for the genocide of jews?,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/18hvgny/has_anyone_at_mit_ever_actually_called_for_the/,56,338,2023-12-14 00:14:02,"The MIT president responded to questioning by saying she is not aware of this ever happening at MIT. Has it ever happened at MIT or Harvard? Congress asking if calling for the genocide of jews violates our harassment policy implies it has happened... I can't find anything about this.

I'm assuming congress is equating the statement ""palestine should be free from the river to the sea"" with ""calling for the genocide of jews"". You could argue they are equal statements but I think that's why the MIT president had so much trouble answering questioning... It sounds bad that we don't condone the genocide of jews. I'm sure if someone actually said that outright, they would face disciplinary action. The question had an implied equation that was not stated. It was incredible loaded... (unless students have explicitly called for the genocide of jews and did not face disciplinary action).

Furthermore, who is congress to say the MIT president should be fired? They are the ones with the weaker law... The first amendment protects hate speech, even if it's directed at an individual, mainly because there is no definition for hate speech in the US. MIT is the one with the more strict law. How can the deviser of a lenient law morally enforce a stricter law that they believe isn't strict enough?"

Eroding MIT PhD Standards,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/18ge0e4/eroding_mit_phd_standards/,0,21,2023-12-12 04:54:30,"An MIT PhD degree is considered to be challenging — and it should be. Unfortunately, the strength and value of the MIT PhD have been gradually eroded over decades. For example, did you know this: you can earn a PhD degree from MIT without completing a single publication? It seems incredible, but it's true. Check for yourself. Once someone is in the MIT PhD program, they can simply wait it out and eventually receive the degree. Often, a department will fault the advisor before the student. Then, the student is passed to another advisor, and perhaps a third, if an unwitting professor is willing to take them on.  Or they go from one TAship to another. 

Eventually, after 6-7 years have passed, the student is awarded a PhD. This has become the effective policy rather than holding someone to a schedule to complete qualifying exams or to meet the PhD requirement of academic research. It’s sad to see how our weak administrators are dismantling this illustrious institution."

I'm debating between 6.1900 (intro to c) or even taking 6.1210/6.006 (intro to algo) even though ill be taking the prereqs at the time. Is 6.006 a bad idea? How strict are prereqs? Is 6.1200 really that necessary? For context, I would say I am a fairly competent programmer (nothing to the level of competitive programmers tho) but I am new to algorithms.

Also do realize this might be a loaded schedule (57-60 credits w 6.009) and I also plan to UROP and have other club committments. But Ive heard that intro algo is class that recruiters look for, and is needed to pass the resume check--and yo gurl needs a job. But then again maybe my time would be better spent elsewhere where I can still build my experiences and skills w/o overcommitting myself.

I thought after finishing my Ph.D, I will get over my MIT dream and find something more interesting but that has not happened yet. So, coming back to the question, is spending 80K worth the dream or I am just plain stupid?

It likely won't get approved this semester, but if it does I'm not sure where I'm gonna go, or who I'll even be returning to. I don't really have any friends on campus, or at least none that make an effort to spend any time with me. I have tried office hours, clubs, and just talking to people in class, but after spending all Freshman and Sophomore year without getting anyone's number or socials etc. I kinda gave up on it... I spent most of my Junior year alone as well and tried to get more involved online and that was a disaster for me. I don't do well online and all I did was cause myself and others more harm. All of this combined with a horrible Summer UROP that made everything worse convinced me that I needed a break and that it was essential to my health. My impostor syndrome has only gotten worse through this time as I started off getting decent grades but now I either get B's, C's, or incompletes. 

While I've been away I've tried to explore more of my interests academically, but I still feel beneath most of the people even at the local college I'm currently at. I'm only really interested in biology, video games, and physics, but I've not accomplished or created anything tangible from these interests. I've also made a few friends locally, but I also understand that this ecosystem is very different from MIT. I've also not been doing the best academically at this college either.

I have also tried to connect with other students in biophysics but as I've been away they've stopped communicating with me and seemingly passed me by. I want to do a UROP but every time (even at Freshman mixers) I've been denied positions. The main professors in the field at MIT haven't even responded to my emails, nor have their graduate students. This may just have been my mental state at the time, but it seems like I don't have what it takes to achieve what I want from MIT. 

If anyone knows of dorms with a relaxed atmosphere or where people have similar interests to me, I'd really appreciate it. I didn't really feel welcome in a lot of communities on campus, it felt like people saw me as shy and didn't want to interact with me because I was too awkward and it has always made me feel so unwanted and disliked. Most of my life I have been sitting in my room playing video games, except when my few friends from high school would call and invite me to do something with them. I really wanted to change this with MIT, but it's always felt like I'm awkward and nerdy in a different way from everyone else and haven't been able to break away from that feeling of isolation.

Sorry for the ramble, basically I was wondering if anyone knew where to find/create a space for myself, or if there was any specific ways you've tried to connect with the MIT community. I'm not good when faced with groups but so many people seem to only exist in their cliques it's hard to approach them. I was thinking about starting a club on retro gaming but I know that it's similar to another club and that's very difficult to make clubs like that. I don't know if I just don't belong because I don't fit in those other related clubs like VGA, or if I'm not putting in enough initiative to make friends myself without those things. I really enjoyed the VGGC to be fair, but it's not something I'm particularly passionate about.

I know I have a lot going on, but I don't know who to talk to about this. It's hard talking to my s3 dean and my advisor, they make me feel incredibly nervous and I feel pressured to lie to make myself seem more confident or else be told things like ""you won't get into graduate school with your GPA"" or ""You don't seem ready for MIT"" (things I've been told by previous MIT faculty). Thanks for reading, any advice would be appreciated."

"As a transfer, is it worthwhile to study for the 8.01 / 8.02 ASEs to validate credit, or am I doing myself a disservice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/17zpray/as_a_transfer_is_it_worthwhile_to_study_for_the/,12,12,2023-11-20 14:29:30,"I’m an incoming transfer student planning on Course 6-3, and I took equivalent courses to these at my previous school over a year ago. I know that I certainly wouldn’t pass the finals for either course if I took them without prepping now, but I have a couple of months and in that time I’m sure I could get myself to a passing point for the ASEs, my question is would doing so be worthwhile? 

On the side of doing it, though more starting credit would be nice my concern is that I won’t actually have the same level of knowledge I would going into the courses they’re prerequisites for, and as I want to do work in modeling/sim and computer graphics I think this could put me at a big disadvantage. Also, there are plenty of other things I think would also be helpful I could do in that time such as learning Python (I’m very experienced in programming just in other languages).

On the flip side, I would hate to take courses that don’t really challenge me as I have learned the material previously (maybe to a lesser degree), and if I could make room for more gainful courses without overburdening myself I’d prefer to go that route.

Any insights would be very much appreciated.

E: Thanks to everyone who answered! I will definitely shoot for knocking out the ASEs, though I’ll probably give it a semester before I go for 8.02"

I will be visiting MIT next Spring as an exchange student. Since I won't be staying for long, I'm considering getting a cheap single at 70 Amherst. I have a few questions I would appreciate your insight on.

\- Is it difficult to get a single as a visiting student at 70 Amherst for the Spring or is there a lot of availability?

\- The housing page says there's some construction happening in the area. Is this noticeable and burdensome or trivial?

\- What is the level of cleanliness of the building and the state of facilities?

\- Is there a strong sense of community? I will be visiting without many friends at MIT so I would love to connect with folks. 

Any info/input is appreciated. Cheers!"

Congratulations to Daniel Stenberg!,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/17vxilr/congratulations_to_daniel_stenberg/,0,22,2023-11-15 16:34:45,"Dear mit hackers,

today I stumbled upon [a new post by Daniel Stenberg](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/11/14/curl-on-100-operating-systems/) in which he proudly highlights that **his curl library now works on 100 different operating systems and 28 different CPU architectures!**

It's an incredible engineering achievement and a **true exemplary example of successfully leading a software project** that aims to be useful to as many people on as many different machines as possible. As long as I live, **I will always emphasize and praise Daniel Stenberg, who has never said something like ""I'm shutting down support for Windows, those who want to run curl on Windows should use WSL, but I don't care, I haven't even tried if it works at all.""** You will never hear something like that from Daniel Stenberg!

**But you will hear exactly that from Chris Hanson, the ""maintainer"" (I intentionally put it in quotes because I don't consider him a maintainer at all, but quite the opposite - he could be called a gravedigger) of the sadly regressing mit-scheme project, which runs on fewer and fewer operating systems and on fewer and fewer different CPU architectures every day!**

I don't know about you, dear Schemers, but whoever I complained to about this, they all criticized me and downvoted me harshly, so I have no doubt it will be the same this time. A few days ago I even wrote a post about it on the /r/mit subreddit, where I was also ridiculed.

To me, it's incredible because MIT is the cradle of Lisp and Scheme, and they allowed their cult implementation, mit-scheme, to fall to such low levels and into the hands of completely the wrong person, inadequate for the task. MIT is full of countless intelligent hackers, programming enthusiasts, but none of them has ever felt the need to take the damn mit-scheme and lift it from the bottom and finally brighten MIT's face as an institution, which is only embarrassing itself when people see how sad the state of mit-scheme is today and in what even sadder state it will be tomorrow if nothing is done.

**Yes, people: spit on me, therefore, as much as you like, but that won't erase the undeniable truth: mit-scheme is declining because of Chris Hanson and because of MIT's negligence as an institution that should (if anyone else!) nurture it like its child in the cradle!**"

Am I doing freshman year terribly wrong?,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/17lj6cp/am_i_doing_freshman_year_terribly_wrong/,68,11,2023-11-01 18:47:33,"At the beginning of the year, I attended every single lecture and recitation in every single one of my classes. However, a common issue I had was not understanding what the professor was saying and becoming a little distracted, and at the end I felt like I only learned bits and pieces of what they were saying. I was on the verge of failing every single quiz, PSET, and more because I simply didn't review the material afterwards because I'm so busy. My recitation leaders are mediocre at best, and one of them has very, very hard trouble answering any questions that are not directly from the piece of paper she prepared earlier. 

A few weeks ago I stopped going to all of my recitations and nearly all of my lectures, and my grades have tremendously improved by 20-30 percent. I'm getting almost perfect scores on weekly quizzes, high grades on midterms, and have a much better of understanding of the material just from reading the lecture notes and doing the recitation problems on my own time. I also take a quarter of the time to do them, which has saved enough time for me to pursue another club. 

However, I just can't shake the feeling that this is all a waste of being at MIT. This has been my dream school since middle school, and now I'm skipping almost all of my classes. My friends all go to class, and seem really surprised I'm skipping them in the first place. Is what I'm doing misguided, or is this actually not that uncommon? "

"MIT Shame: Mit-Scheme Declines into Obscurity, and the Maintainer Shows Little Effort",https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/17ljn9q/mit_shame_mitscheme_declines_into_obscurity_and/,0,24,2023-11-01 19:08:04,"Hello MIT community,

I've decided to share my serious concerns regarding the current state of [mit-scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/), a project deeply rooted in MIT institute. It seems that this implementation of the Scheme programming language is going through a serious period of neglect, and the key maintainer, Chris Hanson, shows little responsibility towards preserving and improving the project.

The latest issues with mit-scheme are evident. Not only does it not work on native Windows or Mac, but there are serious problems with libraries, HTTPS support, and poor/incomplete documentation. What is particularly scandalous is Hanson's admission that he ""hasn't even tried"" to see if mit-scheme works on Windows, despite it working before.

The maintainer of the project should have the foremost concern for its functionality on all platforms, and Hanson's hostility towards the Windows platform is unacceptable, considering how important it is for many users.

MIT has an impressive tradition in creating and developing Lisp and Scheme. However, it seems that the current generations of students and professors unfortunately have lost awareness of the importance of these languages. Instead of continuing to build old MIT tradition (to mention only John McCarthy, Gerald Sussman, Guy L. Steele, etc), mit-scheme is regressing under an inactive maintainer.

What makes this situation even worse is that mit-scheme is crucial, especially since this implementation is used in cult classics like ""Structure and Implementation of Classical Mechanics,"" ""Functional Differential Geometry,"" and the latest Sussman's book ""Software Design for Flexibility: How to Avoid Programming Yourself into a Corner."" The current state of mit-scheme not being able to run on the latest Apple computers with the M2 processor is alarming. Instead of striving for mit-scheme to be an implementation that works easily and effectively on as many different hardware configurations as possible, the current maintainer seems to be trying to make it work on as few as possible. Ironic as it may be, soon mit-scheme might only run on Chris Hanson's Linux-powered toaster!

I urge the MIT community to reflect on the seriousness of the situation and demand action. If the maintainer shows no interest in the functioning of the project on all platforms, perhaps it's time for a change in leadership and finding someone who will dedicate themselves to reviving and enhancing mit-scheme.

And to all MIT students, I appeal to you: You are hackers, proud of the wonders your computer skills can achieve. Do not allow mit-scheme to decay like this: please, perform a miracle and, through joint effort, resurrect it from the dead. Make it once again one of the most modern, fastest, best, and well-documented implementations of the Scheme programming language -- mit-scheme deserves nothing less than that!

I hope that together we can work towards preserving this rich MIT heritage and restoring mit-scheme to its deserved place.

Thank you for understanding."

I was reviewing the curriculum for the MBAn and also attended an online session today. During the presentation they mentioned that students must maintain a 4.5 GPA to graduate. I also saw the same information on this electives guide for the MBAn:

Where it says "" Students are required to maintain a cumulative GPA of 4.5/5.0 in order to graduate""

Should I take that as face value? If I end up with a GPA of 4.4 I am not graduating and loosing my tuition or am I missing something? How hard is it to get a GPA of 4.5 / 5.0 in this program?
