Stalking - Alert by Public Safety,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1gwlfl2/stalking_alert_by_public_safety/,15,4,2024-11-21 17:49:57,"More information about the person who is shown in the picture sent by the public safety in the stalking email:

He is the person who always sits at the last seat at Starbucks. He's always trying to talk to students and I've even seen few women sit with him as I think he encourages them to sit in the empty seat opposite him. I think he goes to starbucks almost everyday and sits at the last seat. One time, on a rainy day, he followed me out of Starbucks and tried talking to me. Before he followed me out, many times he'd stare at me when I was placing an order or standing in the queue to order and then he'd smile if I looked at him. I'd try to not make eye contact but I'd notice him looking. 

He made the new menu displayed on the cart for the Halal Cart on 115th. The white menu with people. I saw him give it to them during the Summer. The reason I noticed him giving it to them is because I remembered him following me out of Starbucks a few days before as I mentioned. And that is also the reason that I noticed him at Starbucks everyday.

I‚Äôm a transfer student coming from community college where I was at the top of my class with a 4.0, but my first semester at Columbia has been a serious wake-up call.

I‚Äôm taking 14 credits this fall (UW, Core Music, Korean, and Calculus 3). UW and Core Music are manageable‚ÄîI‚Äôm holding above 95 in both‚Äîand I‚Äôm pushing through Korean with a 90, even though it‚Äôs super intense (maybe not the best language track choice). But Calculus 3? It‚Äôs absolutely killing me.

I took Calculus 1 almost a year ago, and I didn‚Äôt realize how different the teaching style here would be. No practice exams, no reviews, no formula sheets‚Äîthings that really helped me before. I bombed both midterms, and now I‚Äôm debating whether to drop the course and take a W, something I never imagined having to do.

I‚Äôm questioning whether I‚Äôm even cut out for Columbia or if I‚Äôm just in over my head. Has anyone else felt this way during their first semester? Is it always this rough, or am I doing something wrong? Any advice or perspective would be hugely appreciated."

I want to do the special concentration not for the sake of a better resume, but rather because I want to learn more about entrepreneurial things through marketing management and other courses.

But for me to do the concentration, I would have to pay extra for around 20 credits, as I'm a GS student. 

  
For those who have already finished this concentration or are in the process of it, I'd really appreciate your thoughts on whether it teaches you actually valuable stuff.

I basically applied for MS Express (Spring 25 intake) on Oct 7 this year. And up till now the result has not been out. My GPA is >3.5 so it should not be the issue. My problem is that I need to let them admit me before Spring 25 term starts. 

I already did 5 extra classes on top of 124 credits and I am graduating this Dec. So if I didn't get an admission by Jan 25, I will not be able to count the Spring classes into the MS degree, as they only allow max. of 5 classes taken ""during undergrad"" to be transferred into MS. 

Has anyone ever applied for MS Express (for intake in the coming Spring) while it was Fall, and could you provide me another datapoint or two on whether they would get back to you before the next term starts?

Many thanks.."

Organic chemistry tutoring ,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1grb5mv/organic_chemistry_tutoring/,0,0,2024-11-14 18:10:42,"www.organicchemistrytutoring.ca

Overwhelmed by organic chemistry? Assignments and tests creeping up on you and feeling like you‚Äôre in hot water? Or maybe you‚Äôre doing well and need that 95%? Whatever your struggle with organic chemistry may be, I‚Äôm here to make sure you succeed. 

Why work with me? 

- Every tutor knows the subject, but not every tutor knows how to transfer that knowledge to a student. I do. 
- I tutor organic chemistry full time, it‚Äôs not a hobby or side-gig. When you book with me, you‚Äôll be working only with me, not random people at an agency.
- You‚Äôll be learning problem solving through organic chemistry, which you can apply to many other subjects.
- Your learning will be customized to your specific needs 

Before booking a lesson, let‚Äôs chat about your needs, my teaching style, and what you can expect, to see if we‚Äôd be a good fit together. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to working with you!

If so,

1. Can I still P/D/F it to maintain my GPA for high-finance internship applications and then uncover it at the end of my sophomore year when the recruiting process is done? Also, at that point, one course has less impact for the overall grade.

2. Do Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Computer Science-Mathematics, and other adjacent majors allow P/D/F for Honors Math? I could not find any explicit information on these. 
For example, can I take P/D/F Honors Math to fulfill the Linear Algebra requirement in Computer Science Major¬†and then take Accelerated Multivariable Calculus (UN 1205) or Multv. Calc. for Engi & App Sci (APMA E2000) for the Calculus requirement the following term, forgetting the economics major?

I have to bring this balance to under $1000 by the time class registration rolls around in mid-January.  A balance higher than that and I won't be able to register for classes.

I am getting paid $3600/mo and am trying to pay this off aggressively, in addition to the monthly rent I'm already being charged.  But I was also paid very late (didn't get my first check until October, which put me a month behind) so while I do anticipate being able to pay everything off, it won't be on time for January registration, even if I paid the entirety of my upcoming paychecks to the balance.  

You might suggest that I should open a new credit card, but I currently have a credit limit of about $3500, and have used 90% of it.  I think that's why I've been denied from the two credit cards I've applied to.

What do I do?  Are there student resources that can help, or credit cards that would accept a fair credit score/high utilization?

‚ÄúThe UJB is majority faculty and students, and hasn‚Äôt met for years. Students will not vote to suspend or expel another student, period. Faculty will face severe social repercussions and ostracism from their faculty peers if they vote to suspend or expel a student. Part of this is ideological: they or their peers may personally agree with the cause for which the students are protesting. Part of this is structural: they see themselves as ‚Äòprotecting their kids‚Äô from a cruel and heartless administration. There‚Äôs a real underlying reluctance here as even [former] President Shafik said she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúbecome a university president to punish students.‚Äù Compounding the problem is that while faculty don‚Äôt really want to administer discipline, they believe they have the inherent right to do so as educators, and will oppose any attempts to dilute it or take it away.‚Äù"

The grade was corrected, but it was past the add/drop period and I was not able to drop the course without charge. I have now graduated and have reached out to my dean as well as SFS to try to request to have the fees for the course I took unnecessarily removed from my bill (as I have yet to pay for my final semester due to financial difficulties) seeing as it was not my mistake. SFS referred to GS, and my dean is essentially saying there is nothing that can be done since the class was not dropped during the add/ drop period. (This was also the response I received when I initially inquired with my dean when it first happened.)

A lot of red flags for me before classes started .. for context, I am pursuing an intense industry change (design ‚Äî> STEM) and had a lot of questions regarding my classes and course of action. Firstly before the semester began I scheduled 3 different meetings with my advisor, but they were all rescheduled. When I finally got ahold of her the advice she gave was.. self searchable at best. I started getting worried because I had a lot of questions that I felt were not being answered, and the tuition for a visiting student was 2k per credit. 

I registered, but still had questions - especially about classes with prereqs. A specific class required Calculus and I really didn‚Äôt want to pay 6.5k to take Calc 1 at Columbia.

I was enrolled at Columbia for only one week. From January 16 (classes start) to January 24 (submitted LOA).

I emailed financial services twice about this but I just got a reply that says firmly there was no way around it. Is that true?? It seems ridiculous and way too dismissive for them to do this - the amount of small fees plus my experience with that advisor is crazy. Does anybody have any experience with disputing tuition?

I am looking for your feedback about this situation:

  
I currently attend the school of social work for my master's program. One of the requirements for a master program is to have a practicum placement, which is essentially an internship to receive real life experience in a social work site affiliated through the university. Three weeks ago, I interviewed at a placement (I will keep it anonymous) and I told by the interviewer, who is also the founder, about my full-time work schedule, particularly I would only be available during the evenings and weekends. The next day, I received an offer letter from him, and I accepted it. Before I go further, I need to point out that the interviewer is also the founder who is also the supervisor for me. (There is no hierarchy, it's a one-man organization). Fast forward to last Wednesday, I communicated with him about an assignment that was due for the university. A part of this assignment was specifying when I would be working on the assigned task designated to me through the internship and this needed to be agreed to by him. I wrote that I would be doing most of the work during the evening and on the weekends, the same preferences I stated during my interview with him. We met on Saturday to discuss this further, and he told me that my availability did not work with his because 1) he was only available during the week on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays after 3 pm to 5 pm and then again after 8 pm and 2) on the weekends he would have to travel overseas for business and have personal time. I tried to make it work, saying I was willing to hold any meetings during his schedule, work on some of the tasks during the week such as seeing clients, and then working on research related work during the weekends.  I didn't know I got terminated until after the meeting in which he sent a formal email to the practicum director that I was cc in. He even gave me a task to complete within a week's deadline before the meeting ended.

  
I'm curious to know if I can take any actions against him. I feel blind-sided because I literally made my availabilities clear to him during the interview and I got an offer letter afterwards. Why give me an offer if you knew ahead of time you wouldn't be available on the weekends and have a limited schedule during the week, essentially, not being considerate that our schedules didn't match. He literally terminated me for personal reasons because I did nothing wrong, in terms of ethics, boundaries, or lack of performance. I spoke to the practicum director in the university about it and he literally said it was still my fault. I don't think the university will do anything about this, but what can I do? Is it really my fault as a student? "

If accepted, this change would more closely align with other smoke, vape, and nicotine policies, such as those at Barnard College, Teachers College, and Columbia University Irving Medical Center. 

The Nicotine Awareness & Help (NAH) town hall is an opportunity for community members to come learn about the initiative and ask questions to the leaders of the project. This town hall is open to all Columbia affiliates as well members of the neighboring communities.

Institutional Neutrality at Columbia?,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1g6i8vn/institutional_neutrality_at_columbia/,31,14,2024-10-18 13:37:12,"As those on Columbia email lists will know, Columbia is considering an ""institutional neutrality"" policy -- i.e., one in which Columbia (as a university) comments only *‚Äúmatters of public concern except to offer sentiments of support for those who are directly affected or grieving.‚Äù*¬†

This -- also known as the Chicago rule -- strikes me as a good idea, given that I think of Columbia University as a platform for others to express their views (e.g., scholars, fellows and students), as opposed to a place whose job it is to generate views on complex issues (e.g., a think-tank or a lobbying organization).    Lack of neutrality puts a major burden on comms to be constantly deciding what position is the right one for Columbia in a variety of situations, most of which they aren't expert on.

There are places neutrality is obviously right.  Take a (non-political) example:  people differ on the cellular basis of aging   -- does Columbia University need to have a view (obviously not).   To move to the more political:  should Columbia have a view on whether Canadian PM Justin Trudeau should run for another term?  Would also seem out of line.

That said, some things seem so egregious that it might seem weird for Columbia as an institution to stay silent.  For example, when the civil war or WW2 broke out might have been odd or irresponsible for Columbia to say ""sorry, no opinion on that one, but we regret the harm to the Polish people"").

So maybe the best is a general policy of neutrality, but the Senate can vote out a position if it wants to

I've purposely avoided current controversies ... what do people think?

(Spectator published a debate on this which weirdly pitted a law professor against a college freshman.  The latter stated ""*His dorm is currently home to a diet cherry Pepsi he accidentally bought a month ago and has yet to throw out."")*

The turning point for me was when I was rescuing animals, and my friend said, ""You literally pay for animals to get killed!"" She pointed out my hypocrisy!

I felt annoyed at first, but it made me think.

Obviously, dogs in the US are raised as pets and cows as food. There are differences, but what difference is morally relevant? And why not focus on our similarities? In one way, we are all similar: our capacity to feel pain. If you stab a cow, a dog, a cat, or a chicken, they all suffer.

The discussion here led to the foundation of the concept of veganism, which I used to view as a diet. But it's actually a principle that rejects the notion that animals are our resources and should be exploited.

I loved these conversations and really enjoyed chatting with so many open-minded students at Columbia!

Onward and upward towards a better world, where people and non-human animals are safe and not exploited ‚úåüí™

Columbia vs Cornell Chem/CS,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1g3ljmi/columbia_vs_cornell_chemcs/,0,15,2024-10-14 17:31:33,"Hi all, I'm having to make the difficult decision of deciding whether to ED Columbia or Cornell. I'd like to double major in Computer Science and Chemistry

I heard (?) from other sources that Columbia makes it kind of hard to dual major with its core requirements and that Cornell is better for the above majors.   
However, I don't really think I'd like Cornell's location, and there's just an air about the school that I don't like... I also live in NYC, so I wouldn't really need to change too much if I choose Columbia (assuming I even get accepted). And also the Manhattan location would make it easier for me to network and intern and such (I also visited, and I liked the campus, although I didn't get to visit Cornell)  
But I was wondering if I could get other opinions. People praise Cornell engineering a lot in my school, but no one ever talks about Columbia for some reason (engineering or otherwise) 

I also have a far better chance of getting into Cornell, but yeah  
Sorry for the yapping but I'm crazy stressed over this decision :/ "

Can anyone who's lived in or been to some postdoc flats share any information, like buildings to target or avoid? I'll be looking for a one-bedroom, not sure if furnished or unfurnished (also grateful for advice on this).

I can see there are options for postdocs in the following streets (though I don't know yet which will be available to me): Broadway (2700), Claremont Ave, Morningside Dr, Riverside Dr, 110th, 111th, 112th, 113th, 114th, 115th, 116th, 118th, 119th, 120th (and 125th, though they're finishing up building it still).

Core is the stupidest idea,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1fugurk/core_is_the_stupidest_idea/,0,13,2024-10-02 13:59:23,"Look, I wanna just rant about this: Core is the stupidest idea, especially in the modern world, and here are partially why:

* Many modern fields are so evolved and getting to the next step is so competitive, so it is very important for people to be able to have focus. Splitting focus to things like those in the core is probably one of the worst ways to waste time as it neither rests you or help you learn your fields.
* Core is almost never well calibrated for people in the class. They are either too hard or too easy for some people. To make up for that, instead of diversifying for sections, cores are made to be extremely annoying. Like I've yet to hear humanities people say LitHum is a breeze, and I've seen many people really really strong at STEM getting below an A in frosci. The reason is not because the content is hard, but, I guess in order to make it ""fair"", cores are designed such that you can't do too well if you don't spend time. Not because the time is spent to learn but the time is spent on ""required recitations"" ""required participations."" There's this one class where we spent 45 minutes trying to solve the $v$ in lorentz factor given the factor's value. Like, wow. And getting participation points taken off for not participating in balancing a quadratic equation for 45 minutes, it's like, wow. This point also then implies the first point because of how much time you actually have to spend -- its rarely like it will be a breeze just because it's easy content, because they somehow manage to make it time-consuming anyways.

I'll not donate a dime, nor sending anyone in my family to Columbia until they remove the Core entirely or adjust it (like how physics has 1400, 1600, 2800, they should at least have stratifications like these for Core classes). I'm putting this here hoping anyone who cares at Columbia could push for this change.

Direct quote from the Core to Commencement website: ""You keep these on your bookshelf because they make you feel smarter, even if you can't remember what they're about."" The fact that people think its worth bragging about in the Columbia admin that they made us go through all these just so that we can put these books on the shelf and brag without remembering anything about them is like... I'm wordless. If the admin reads what this quote is saying, they should remove core."

Hi everyone,

Due to my partner changing jobs - and job location - we have to give up our amazing 2 bedroom apartment in Hamilton Heights. I am currently at the business school so I assume it might be of interest to you guys here!

 I am sharing pictures both from the original ad and from my current setup. The apartment gets a lot of light since it is facing east. The amenities have been great and the staff also has been wonderful.
The location is also really convenient if you are a student at Columbia's med school campus or at Columbia Business School.
You‚Äôre right next to the Hudson and also Riverbank State Park about 10mins away which has tennis courts, football courts, athletics track, pool, basketball, etc.

I will be giving the apartment unfurnished and this would be for a lease assignment for the remainder of the lease. Standard requirements apply (40x the rent or guarantors). The current lease runs until 31st of May 2025 with possibility to renew afterwards. 

Move-in date is pretty flexible, but ideally early november would be great!
Please feel free to reach out for a tour of the apartment or a virtual video tour.

We have loved living here and would not move if our circumstances weren't changing.

The Apartment:
- Massive 2 Bedroom with East views
- Bedrooms Fitting Queen/King Beds
- Stainless Steel Kitchen with Dishwasher
- Washer/Dryer in Unit

Columbia College Tuition and Fees,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1frwg73/columbia_college_tuition_and_fees/,6,2,2024-09-29 04:34:14,"Incoming international Student here. 

The Bulletin says the expected total expenses per Academic Year is $92,742 + Travel. How accurate is this number? 

I am concerned that there might be fees not included in the bulletin's calculation. 

Is an overload of credits an issue? I am expecting to take at least 18 credits every semester. Does Columbia calculate the tuition based on credits?

Now I don't eat their everyday I must admit, but literally everytime someone has been chewed out or caught some serious sas from her. It also doesn't help that she alternates the swipe location throughout the day so people always walk past her on accident.

One noticeable experience was last week when this dude went up to exchange a sandwich because apparently they put a meat sandwich in the veggie section. She said, ""HUH where did you get this from?!"" Then the dude pointed to the veggie section and she shot back with, ""No you didn't, nah huh, you have to pay attention next time! Read the sign!"" and its useful to mention this dude was clearly an international student with a heavy accent so I think he was processing what she was yelling so in the 2 seconds it took him to gather a repsonse she yells, ""Read. You can read? Please pay attention. Its fine this time, don't let me see you doing it again!"" Dude walked away and muttered something that I have to assume was unpleasant.

Oh and she talks with another worker there all the time too who also enjoys getting in on it very often so sometimes people will just randomly have two very loud ladies yelling at them and you can't even understand what they're saying.

One of the biggest challenges you‚Äôll face is managing your workload. Staying organized is key. Tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) were lifesavers for me. They helped me keep track of classes, assignments, and all the extracurriculars I was juggling. Sync your calendar across devices so you never miss a deadline. The sooner you get in the habit of using these tools, the smoother your semester will go.

2. Leverage Campus Resources Early

If there‚Äôs one thing I regret, it‚Äôs not using campus resources sooner. Your school offers amazing support like the writing center, career services, and mental health resources. Don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre struggling ‚Äî start using these from day one.

3. Stay Connected with Campus Activities

Getting involved in campus life will enrich your experience and help you build connections. Whether it‚Äôs joining a club, attending events, or just getting to know your peers, staying active is crucial. Download [Circles Verified](https://circlesverifiedapi.com/), an app that keeps you in the loop about everything happening on campus. I found out about so many cool events through it that I would‚Äôve otherwise missed.

4. Network with Professors and TAs

One of the best pieces of advice I got was to make an effort to get to know my professors and TAs. They‚Äôre not just there to grade your work, they can be valuable mentors and connectors for your future. Don‚Äôt just show up during exam season. Make attending office hours a regular thing. You‚Äôll be surprised at how much more you can learn and the doors it can open.

5. Prioritize Mental Health and Wellness

The pressure at a top school can be intense. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the hustle and forget to take care of yourself. But trust me, your mental health is just as important as your grades. Apps like [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) and [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) were my go-to for managing stress. Some schools even offer free access, so definitely check that out.

Tools to Help You Succeed:

* [**Notion**](https://www.notion.so/): For organizing notes, tasks, and schedules.
* [**Google Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/): To keep track of your classes and deadlines.
* [**Circles Verified**](https://circlesverifiedapi.com/): Stay updated on campus events and activities.
* [**Headspace**](https://www.headspace.com/) or [**Calm**](https://www.calm.com/): For managing stress and maintaining mental wellness.

I'd ran away from home after my mum disowned me for my sexuality. I was 17 and incredibly alone at the time. I'd never even been to NYC before but had this idea that I could build a fresh start there. I'd hang out at the easy Internet cafe in times square and chat online since I had no one I knew out there. I ended up befriending a guy in a gay chat room who used the name Curtis and invited me to hang out at his dorm.

I have not been able to go to class‚Äîlike at all. I have only been to two classes out of the 24 lapsed classes these two weeks. 

I have terrible imposter syndrome. It is so bad that I do not want to ask questions in class, or even show up. I feel like I am taking someone‚Äôs spot. I have done terrible academically since I have gotten to Columbia (2022). I have a GPA of roughly 2.3. 

I was president of every club, valedictorian, and a gay kid from rural town. My senior year, I held a political position that caused me to be in the public eye in my county‚Äîmore than ever before. It caused lots of homophobia and bullying to the point that I was hospitalized in a psychiatric. It really messed with me, and I haven‚Äôt been able to get out of that trench since. I still feel everything they say and it is the voice of my inner saboteur. 

The PTSD from this entire situation has taken me over two years to start to heal from, and I think I have only healed around 10%, if that. I am telling myself that everyone is different with the healing process, but I feel like i‚Äôm manually stuck. Lastly, I do not want to take a year or semester off. I have no where else to stay other than my hometown and I don‚Äôt think I can mentally handle it right now. Also, New York has been my home forever to be honest. I came up here every weekend and drove 3 hours‚Äîjust to feel safe. 

Additionally, I will not attend a rehab/in patient service. I have a terrible, terrible experience at a terrible, terrible hospital. I am still so disgusted for the dehumanizing treatment and lack of care for patient health. I felt like I was in a detention center because I did something bad. 

That was a lot but if you read this please give advice or help in anyway you deem fit. I just want to learn again so bad. I have not been able to do academics because I avoid it. I just want to love school again. I‚Äôve had that love my whole life and I feel like after the trauma and pain of my senior year, it went into hiding. I think to try and help me, but it‚Äôs kind of destroying me.

Oh, wait. I also forgot to mention I go to psychotherapy every week who also is my psychiatrist. I love her and I think she has helped me through this‚Äîespecially since she used to work at Columbia until she quit because of the neglect she personally experienced working here.

Willing to pay $40/hr for a crash course CS tutor,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1fdbson/willing_to_pay_40hr_for_a_crash_course_cs_tutor/,0,5,2024-09-10 07:00:22,"Hi all, CS at CC '27. There's a few CS electives I am wanting to take throughout my time here, but don't think I'll have space for.

I'm willing to pay $40/hour (negotiable only if you're truly cracked, a previous TA for a class, etc) for a CS tutor in **select** electives who can give me a crash course on a class(es).

The sessions (I imagine) would just be us flitting through a textbook/your notes/previous assignments, with me trying to understand concepts as quickly as I can and firing off questions at you whenever I don't understand something.

Specifically, here's what I'm looking for

* 2-3 hours per week of dedicated/scheduled time, similar to a class.
* Content that generally follows the progression of the actual class. It'd be really good if you had chronological notes/could spitball summaries of the lectures off the top of your head.
* Copies of the assignments/hw/projects. Given the nature of these sessions, I neither want nor expect you to give me the homework/assignments for me to do on my own. I'd much prefer we just go over what homeworks look like and the important concepts. 
* If you have a class project you did, then I'd like you to walk me through the project that you completed so that I have a general understanding of what you did/how you did/what might have been expected of me to have learned in the class instead of me coding it up myself. Not ideal and this may be subject to change, but more of an exploratory thing.
* Proof that you got an A in the class/know the concepts. Much better if you've ever TA'ed for the class/are a very good programmer.

Hours may vary depending on our schedule.

The electives I'm willing to pay this service for are:

1. **CV1, CV2, or DL for CV \*\*\*\*** 
2. **COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS OF ROBOTICS**
3. **INTRODUCTION TO DATABASES/DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION** (i'm looking for something deeper than just connecting to mysql and writing a couple queries. ideally you can walk me through making my own db in C or something).
4. **COMPUTER NETWORKS**
5. **COMPUTER GRAPHICS**
6. **COMPUT TECHNIQUES-PIXEL PROCSS**
7. **Any higher level probability/combinatorics course**
8. **ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS 1** (or anything similar).
9. **ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/NLP/UNSUPERVISED LEARNING, ETC** (or any other AI/ML course besides Machine Learning with Verma).
10. Not an elective, but if you're good at **Rust** and think you can teach me in a semi-structured way how to go from beginner to writing performant backends, then I'd pay for this as well. Same goes for Go/any language you can make a convincing case for.
11. **Any ML/AI-related research project you've done, on the condition that it's reasonably technical and is more than just training a GPT.**

But if you're really good at any other CS elective and would be interested, I'd be happy with that as well. Most things in computer science interest me, just be comfortable with the course material!

Please dm even if you think the pay is too low or you know a friend who may be interested!"

I am a Barnard junior majoring in CS, hoping to take a probability course this semester. I have never taken a probability course before. I have taken MATH UN2010 Linear Algebra last Spring, and I am wondering if any of you can give me suggestions for probability courses. I am currently enrolled in MATH UN2015 Linear Algebra and Probability, and I have heard that Probability for Engineers is a good fit (but it conflicts with my Databases (COMS W4111) course, I am not sure whether Vergil is truly up to date with Probability for Engineers not being full yet, and I don't want to risk potentially being on the waitlist for both these classes if I drop Databases). I am thinking of following the new curriculum.

I joined my first MATH UN2015 Linear Algebra and Probability class today with Professor Sorensen, and it seems great. It finishes the simple Linear Algebra section (probably just the basic math and proofs part) at the end of September; then it goes over probability and the applications of Linear Algebra and Probability for the rest of the semester. I am worried that this course might feel a bit repetitive since I have already taken the MATH UN2010 course. Would MATH UN2015 Linear Algebra and Probability be helpful in giving me a solid probability foundation that would be sufficient for AI and ML courses in the future? Thank you!"

We want a teacher who is NOT focussed on teaching to tests or evaluations but instead engages with a variety of materials such as math games, puzzles, and different ways of approaching the same fundamental concepts.

Both parents are statisticians (Bayesian) and have a love for math and science, one of whom is a Columbia alumnus.

Hi All,

I graduated 2023 from the undergrad school and hate going back due to something that happened right before graduation. Currently a masters student at the Medical campus (168th street). I had to step foot on main campus on 116th street Broadway 5 times and cried 4 times during the 2023/2024 academic year.

I agreed to TA a course for a PI I do research for at the medical campus. I thought it would be at the medical campus(168th street broadway), but it‚Äôs on main campus( 116th street broadway). It‚Äôs somewhat too late to turn down the opportunity. I have to be on campus 4 times in person and the rest of the TA-ship position is remote. I just wanted someone to please escort me on main campus 4 times for emotional support. I‚Äôm willing to pay. I‚Äôd honestly prefer a Columbia undergrad alumni if possible who did not graduate too long ago.

Stepping on main campus is a reminder of a transitional period for me given what happened close to my graduation and I have not been the same. I hate stepping there cause it‚Äôs a very sharp reminder of what happened and the transition that ensued as a result.
 
Update : Anyone who thinks they might be able to help, please pm me. Would love if multiple people can reach out üôè

Thank you so much to everyone who emailed/was interested. It means so much. Thank you.**

Currently looking for anyone interested in getting themselves a bigger room before the semester starts.

Offering right now a minimum 166sqft sized room in Woodbridge in exchange for any senior currently in a single - unfortunately needs to be a senior, Columbia does not authorize housing swaps out of same year.

Woodbridge suites are listed as ""doubles"" - but the space offered is much larger than the rest of campus.

[\(Room offered is 7B - Right above this room, same dimensions \[they were not on the 7th floor image online\]\)](https://preview.redd.it/h8nfsk1uxukd1.png?width=254&format=png&auto=webp&s=456544fcf61a2f74144165e6a8dafb39107315d4)

In addition, you also have closets and a designated kitchen and bath shared between you and the other person in the suite. With some adjusting, this becomes a better offer than a broadway or wien single, at the cost of very mild privacy.

I would also be willing to help whoever accepts this trade move in.

Please consider it, it's a really good space and if it weren't for entirely personal reasons I would definitely take this massive double over a low floor broadway single or the like.

Again, this is open to absolutely any senior in a single anywhere on campus. Please give it more thought before being dissuaded by the thought of ""senior year in a double.""

New $400 Million Donation from Roy and Diana Vagelos,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1eyr8g8/new_400_million_donation_from_roy_and_diana/,39,7,2024-08-22 18:47:21,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

We are deeply honored to announce today a new $400 million gift from Roy and Diana Vagelos, which will secure Columbia‚Äôs leadership in biomedical science research and education and produce a vast array of compelling opportunities for improving society‚Äôs health and wellbeing. The gift is the single largest ever made to our medical school and, taken together with their previous giving, establishes Roy and Diana as the most generous donors in the history of Columbia University. It is a remarkable distinction, one that warrants recognition and our enduring gratitude. For all of us who know Roy and Diana, however, we can state confidently that at this moment they would urge us to focus not on them but on the design and purposes of this gift, the ways in which it will complement and accelerate previous initiatives they have funded, and the work required to harness science and education to alleviate human suffering and advance society.

A principal function of this gift will be to significantly expand the mission of the Vagelos-funded institute created last year. The Roy and Diana Vagelos Institute for Basic Biomedical Science will now provide the infrastructure to unite cutting-edge research taking place in our basic science departments, our leading medical and graduate education programs, and the exemplary research initiatives in our clinical departments in a new dynamic organizational model. By assembling this mix of mutually reinforcing activities, we seek to build the world‚Äôs foremost ecosystem for biomedical research and to attract the next generation of exceptionally creative and collaborative scientists able to realize this vision.

The gift we announce today also will support construction of the new biomedical research building, to be known as the Vagelos Innovation Laboratories, at 167th Street and Audubon Avenue, on the Washington Heights medical campus. This facility will provide more than 55,000 square feet of new laboratory space. We are also immensely proud of the fact that this new building will be a model of sustainability: the very first fully-electrified, university-owned laboratory building in New York City.

Roy and Diana‚Äôs generous gift also provides major support for the medical school‚Äôs programs in cell engineering and gene therapy and will expand innovative collaborations that harness recent breakthroughs and new technologies. Research to advance these next-generation therapies will revolutionize treatment for a wide variety of diseases ranging from disorders of the blood and immune system to cancers, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory, neurological, and cardiovascular conditions, representing a new paradigm in medicine.

It is truly awe-inspiring to envision the discoveries and new knowledge this gift will enable, in world-class laboratories bolstered by the resources and innovative structure of the Vagelos Institute.

The legacy of Roy and Diana Vagelos at Columbia University and in the world of philanthropic support for biomedical research and education was already well established before the announcement of this historic gift. They are unique benefactors guided by laudable values that became guiding principles for our school. Their sustained commitment to education, scientific research, and human health, in general‚Äîand to Columbia, in particular‚Äîis simply unmatched. The impact of their philanthropy will extend far beyond Columbia and be felt for generations to come. From the construction of the spectacular Vagelos Education Center, to the creation of a scholarship initiative that sparked a nationwide revolution to address affordability in medical education, it is difficult to conceive of our medical campus without their contributions. We take as a point of pride that our medical school bears the Vagelos name. This latest gift comes at a critical inflection point for the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. The confluence of fresh thinking about the future of basic and translational biomedical research from our brilliant faculty, a structured strategic planning effort aimed at strengthening VP&S, a thriving clinical practice embracing growth and innovation, and a bedrock institutional commitment to building a more equitable health care system, all make this an auspicious moment in the life of our institution.

In the weeks and months ahead, we will organize opportunities to express our gratitude to Roy and Diana and honor their commitment to supporting our students and faculty as they push the boundaries of science and medicine to advance equitable health. Indeed, Roy‚Äôs storied career as a physician, scientist, and executive in the pharmaceutical industry embodies a belief in the power of science and education to alleviate human suffering and improve society at large.

In the meantime, and on behalf of the countless students, faculty, and patients who will long benefit from their incomparable legacy, we want to express our deep appreciation to Roy and Diana, both for their truly visionary leadership and for their faith in Columbia, its people, and our shared future.

uninhabitable Columbia University housing - leaky ceiling and mold,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1eu1u8o/uninhabitable_columbia_university_housing_leaky/,16,8,2024-08-16 22:25:58,"Hey everyone, I need some advice regarding a situation with Columbia housing. My dorm has a serious mold issue that's been affecting my health, and now they're trying to evict me.

I moved into this new dorm in March and noticed a leaky roof. Over time, the water started forming bubbles in the ceiling, which dried out in April and then became flaky. Soon after, I began experiencing symptoms like difficulty breathing, sneezing, a runny nose, and itchy eyes. I reported the problem to Columbia housing, but all they did was patch it up with oil paper. Now, the moisture has caused the entire ceiling to become moldy!

I went back to California from mid-May to July to recover and only felt better after that. I reported the issue to HPD, and now they're finally looking into fixing the ceiling. However, it‚Äôs going to be a challenge because the penthouse terrace is right above.

Is there anything I can do to get compensated at this point?

President Shafik has resigned,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1esgva1/president_shafik_has_resigned/,109,40,2024-08-15 00:03:33,"> Dear members of the Columbia community,

> I write with sadness to tell you that I am stepping down as president of Columbia University effective August 14, 2024. I have had the honor and privilege to lead this incredible institution, and I believe that‚Äîworking together‚Äîwe have made progress in a number of important areas. However, it has also been a period of turmoil where it has been difficult to overcome divergent views across our community. This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has for others in our community. Over the summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead. I am making this announcement now so that new leadership can be in place before the new term begins.

> My whole professional life has been devoted to public service and my time at Columbia has been an important part of that commitment. In terms of next steps, I am honored to have been asked by the UK‚Äôs Foreign Secretary to chair a review of the government‚Äôs approach to international development and how to improve capability. I am very pleased and appreciative that this will afford me the opportunity to return to work on fighting global poverty and promoting sustainable development, areas of lifelong interest to me. It also enables me to return to the House of Lords to reengage with the important legislative agenda put forth by the new UK government.

> I have informed the Board of Trustees, and I would like to express my immense appreciation to them for their support. I am committed to working with the Interim President to ensure an orderly transition. I also want to pay tribute to the deans, the University Leadership Team, and the staff of the President‚Äôs Office with whom I have worked so closely this last year; they have and will continue to do an extraordinary job for our students, faculty, researchers, staff, and community.

> During my inauguration, I spoke of Columbia as an exemplar of a great 21st century university committed to educating leaders and citizens, generating knowledge and ideas to solve problems, and engaging at the local and global level to deliver real impact in improving people‚Äôs lives. As president, I have been proud to witness Columbia making so many contributions to delivering that vital mission. I also spoke about the values and principles which are dear to me and, I know, to the Columbia community as well: academic freedom and free speech; openness to ideas; and zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind‚Äîincluding gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, or ethnicity. This mission, and the values and principles underpinning it, constitute our North Star. Even as tension, division, and politicization have disrupted our campus over the last year, our core mission and values endure and will continue to guide us in meeting the challenges ahead.

> I have tried to navigate a path that upholds academic principles and treats everyone with fairness and compassion. It has been distressing‚Äîfor the community, for me as president and on a personal level‚Äîto find myself, colleagues, and students the subject of threats and abuse. As President Lincoln said, ‚ÄúA house divided against itself cannot stand‚Äù‚Äîwe must do all we can to resist the forces of polarization in our community. I remain optimistic that differences can be overcome through the honest exchange of views, truly listening, and‚Äîalways‚Äîby treating each other with dignity and respect. Again, Columbia‚Äôs core mission to create and acquire knowledge, with our values as foundation, will lead us there.

> That is what we owe each other.

> I want to conclude by thanking the entire Columbia community for their support and understanding. This is truly one of the world‚Äôs great institutions with a proud history and legacy of achievement. Having come to know and work with the amazing people here‚Äîpassionate, intelligent, committed‚ÄîI have no doubt that Columbia‚Äôs future will be even more illustrious.

> My profound thanks for the privilege of serving you.

> Sincerely,

> Minouche Shafik

"If offered again, don't pass up on COMS 'Math for ML' ",https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1esdnyw/if_offered_again_dont_pass_up_on_coms_math_for_ml/,27,9,2024-08-14 21:44:22,"This is a PSA for potential future MSCS students interested in ML. If you ever have the opportunity to take [Math for ML](https://samuel-deng.github.io/math4ml_su24/) taught by Samuel Deng, **do not pass up on it**. I was among a lucky few to take this class over this summer, and I'll explain below. Sam might offer this class in 2025/2026.¬†

**Course Overview:**

This is probably one of the best courses I have taken to develop a solid introductory understanding in convex optimization, and the groundwork for the math you will need to excel in any other machine learning class. Simply put, there is nothing like it. In fact, Sam created this class with the express goal of helping strengthen the core fundamentals you need for classes like 4771. While this course is meant to help 'prime' you with the necessary theory needed to excel in more advanced classes, it is not to be underestimated. It is *rigorous* in its coverage of fundamental concepts. Those concepts are the bedrock for building up to all the advanced ML in future classes. Sam goes into extensive detail about connecting several pillars in ML together to paint a cohesive picture on why we do what we do with models. What made the course special, was that Sam was there to guide us throughout the process. This class was the ideal balance of being challenging in a manner that is justified, motivated, inspiring, and (with a good work ethic) very doable.¬†

**As an instructor:**

At the time of writing this, Sam is a PhD student. I can say quite confidently that he is probably of the best instructors I have personally encountered. I always found him super approachable and incredibly passionate. He went out of his way to help us understand concepts , going so far as to re-derive entire theorems in OH. The course itself is very well organized. It definitely puts you into a better position to understand how to approach things like research papers. To give you an idea of how committed he is, his lectures are accompanied with [interactive 3D renderings of graphs](https://samuel-deng.github.io/math4ml_su24/story_ls/ls4_1.html) he made himself, and problem sets that have entire expositions written to guide you through each concept. He has put in the work to give you the best experience you can have to learn as much as possible.¬†

**Workload:**

Bear in mind this is likely subject to change depending on if/how Sam decides to re-create the course for a future semester schedule.¬†

This is a challenging class.

* 6 problem sets

We write out all our PSets in Latex (something you will learn in PSet 0 if you have never done it before.) You will be deriving a lot of foundational proofs. Each PSet also includes a programming section in python. You need to put aside adequate time to understand the lectures and complete these questions. For some this may come easier than others (i.e you have great mathematical intuition these Psets will be readily manageable.) For many, it will take some grit and effort to work your way through them. Having said that, I felt motivated going through the PSets. They felt meaningful, and I learned a great deal.¬†

* 2 paper evaluations

The paper evaluations are a way to encourage you to choose a paper and dissect it in some detail. It was a great exercise to better understand how to apply what we learnt in class to interpreting literature.

**Overall**:

I wanted to write this because I honestly felt so lucky to have taken this course and I really want more people to take it if it's offered in the future. **Get your moneys worth, don't pass up on it if it's offered again.**"
WES for credential verification isn't great,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1esovd1/wes_for_credential_verification_isnt_great/,4,4,2024-08-15 07:11:58,"I'm an incoming MA student, and like most graduate courses, we have to verify past academic qualifications using a third party called World Education Services (WES). 

1. They charge hundreds of dollars what I believe can be a rather automated process which we're forced to pay. I suspect they can charge such high fees since their students are price inelastic (we have to pay to enroll in university), and the university which engages such a service does not directly pay as much out of pocket, with students bearing the cost.
2. They take very long to process it (I've submitted everything last month and it still is ""in progress""). 
3. Customer service doesn't work either. There is no number to call. You can ask a question via their chatbot after logging in and submit a ticket but I have not received any response (sent a ticket about 1.5 weeks ago).

Columbia and quite a number of US universities use WES probably because it is much more convenient for the university offices/ administrators to handle verification, but the experience for incoming students is really sub-optimal... a sad state of affairs.

A friend entering Stanford told me that he didn't have to engage any third party service and Stanford verifies credentials themselves.

**Is it normal for the credentials verification to take so long? The deadline for verification is October so there is still time but it's getting frustrating since WES's website initially said 7 working days (iirc)**"

The gates are closed again,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1erduxh/the_gates_are_closed_again/,144,129,2024-08-13 17:29:11,"Not a student but I've lived in the neighborhood for many years. I often pass through campus on runs or walks. It was on a morning run last Spring when I saw the first tents go up. Campus was soon closed to the public for months. This summer it opened again. Yes, many of the gates remained closed but you could get in. Well, they're closed again. May be because they're prepping for the arrival of students but I've run through campus for years and usually had no trouble getting through, even while bleachers, etc. were being set up. So I imagine that security is prepping to avoid a repeat of last Spring.

I've always loved the way the neighborhood changes along with the academic calendar. It's always exciting in the Fall when students arrive. The energy changes and everything feels fresh. I'm saddened to say this is the first time I've ever not looked forward to the return of Columbia students. The summer has been great. The streets are quiet and conflict free. The campus has been open to the public. There's an element of trust and respect that was not here in April and May. I'm sad to see that there are signs that's all going away and that we are likely to return to where we were 4 months ago. 

So a plea to Columbia students: Don't screw this up. Don't ruin the neighborhood. Don't ruin your fellow students' experience. Don't assume the worst intentions from anyone you disagree with. Don't pass up on the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity you have. "

is 18 credits too much?,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1er9d47/is_18_credits_too_much/,2,10,2024-08-13 14:31:07,"I‚Äôve been planning my schedule as an incoming freshman at SEAS, and I‚Äôve realized it adds up to 18 credits. The classes are AoE (4), Gen Chem (4), Intro to Mechanics (3), Principles of Econ (4), and Calc 2 (3). The only course I can really drop is Econ, but I want to get my reqs out of the way. I could sub Comp Sci for Econ but that only reduces my total credits by 1. I‚Äôve also heard that AoE isn‚Äôt particularly difficult, and I‚Äôm taking the easier physics and chem tracks. Everyone has warned me to not spread myself thin, but none of these subjects are new to me except Econ. Is this manageable?"
Which professor for Calc I?,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/1er9x6a/which_professor_for_calc_i/,1,3,2024-08-13 14:53:43,"Hey everyone,
I‚Äôm an incoming international freshman at SEAS, and I‚Äôm trying to decide between Marco Castronovo and George Dragomir for Calc I (UN1101) this Fall semester. The other professor either have no reviews or are listed as TBD. My goal is to fully grasp the material, so I‚Äôm looking for a professor who explains concepts clearly and makes the class engaging and worthwhile.

If you‚Äôve taken the class with either of these professors, I‚Äôd love to hear about your experiences. Who would you recommend, and why? Any insights would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"
