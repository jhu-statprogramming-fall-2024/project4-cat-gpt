Some examples of this could look like: ""What are my odds of getting in EA?"", ""How do my HS credits/AP/IB/DE look on my transcript?"", ""When are parking lots assigned?"", ""Do I need to take MATH1113 to transfer?"", or ""When can we pick housing?"".

This applies to individual college questions, such as Terry and the College of Engineering as well, such as: ""What are my chances of getting into finance?"" or ""I got a C in ACCT2101, can I still get into MIS?"".

Spreading Awareness that Classical Armenian will be offered next spring,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/1guhiof/spreading_awareness_that_classical_armenian_will/,46,19,2024-11-18 22:27:37,"**UPDATE: TIME MOVED TO MW 5:30-6:45**

Next Spring, Classical Armenian will be taught at UGA, by Jared Klein.

I really want enough students to sign up for the course for it not be canceled since I highkey chose my program at UGA because they offer this course.

If anyone here is interested (grad or undergrad):

**1.**¬†You do not have to take this for a grade, you just have to sign up to officially audit (3 credit hours).

**2.**¬†You should have some basic knowledge of linguistics (or philology, or Armenian) in order to do well. Klein is an Indo-Europeanist and will be focusing on the development of Armenian from PIE in the context of the rest of the IE languages, as well as the grammar of the oldest recorded stage of the language.

**3.**¬†You will have a slight leg up at the beginning of the course if you can read and write Armenian. Learning the alphabet is part of the course, however.

Course Number:

**LING 4904**¬†(Undergrad)

**LING 6904**¬†(Grad)

If you know someone who would be interested, please let them know this course is being offered in the spring semester! Thanks, everyone! Description of the course will be posted in the comments. Any questions, leave a comment or DM me!

MODS: I am unsure if this has to go in the class megathread or not. Since it is not a question about courses I am unsure. Just want this course to make and it helps if more people who might be interested know that it exists. Let me know if this is not ok here.

Edit: Added meeting time, made changes for clarity. **updated for time change** the correct time is now at the top of the post.

As of Nov 18: We need **2 more grads or 4 more undergrads** signed up (or some combination thereof) for the class to make."

    ‚Ä¢	Forum Section: A space for Reddit-like conversations, where you can share ideas, ask questions, and connect with others in an open community setting.

Readmission Application ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/1goikog/readmission_application/,6,3,2024-11-11 03:13:07,"Hey y‚Äôall!!

I‚Äôve been gone from UGA since January 2024, so my last time taking classes was the semester from August 2023-December 2023. I know UGA requires students to apply for readmission after missing 3 straight semesters of school, so I‚Äôm applying for readmission since my student status is inactive. I‚Äôm a bit annoyed tbh because I‚Äôve met with people from SCO and both of my advisors and none of them told me I would need to reapply. Oh well whatever. 

My question is what are my chances of readmission for Spring 2025? I left school because of severe mental health issues, so my GPA tanked a bit there, but I‚Äôve done the hardship withdrawal for one semester, and will probably get my second one accepted around this Wednesdayish. Is there a chance I could be rejected? I literally just need like 6 classes to graduate and I‚Äôm done, so I really would rather finish now than wait another semester or year. 

I didn‚Äôt have any behavioral/academic infractions, my GPA just sucked (it‚Äôs ~2.9 with 3 Fs from the semester I‚Äôm hardship withdrawing). Is this like college admissions 2.0, and I should apply to KSU or GHC in case of rejection?  

Thanks for any insight :)

EDIT: Okay, so in case anyone is in a similar boat as me, here is a quick edit. I was readmitted. They release the decisions for returners (and transfers) every Friday at 4:00 EST, so if you submit on a Monday don‚Äôt stress if you aren‚Äôt admitted immediately. I read something from Franklin that said returners will not be rejected, so if you have a lower GPA like me and were nervous I think it will be fine. Good luck! "

Additionally, is it hard to adjust as a transfer student? I know that college is a big adjustment in general, especially with the size of UGA, but is anything particularly difficult relating to academic opportunities, finding friends, etc for transfer students more so than other students? Also, what is the dorm situation like for transfer students? Should I be looking at off campus housing or try to get a dorm room?"

With the 2024 presidential election approaching, I wanted to share a project that‚Äôs aimed at raising awareness and encouraging more people to get out and vote. It‚Äôs called¬†[Presidential Pick'em](https://presidentialpickem.com/), and it allows you to predict the outcome of the election by filling out your own electoral map.

It‚Äôs a fun way to get people thinking about the election while also contributing to some crowdsourced data. The goal is to compare predictions to actual results and hopefully spark more engagement in the election process, particularly since Georgia is a critical swing state this election and early voting has already begun.

Each prediction will be scored based on how accurate it was and the results will be displayed on a global leaderboard. You can also create and join pools to challenge friends, roommates, or other groups.

I've created a pool specifically for students and alumni from UGA to join and compete against each other.

[Join the UGA pool here.](https://presidentialpickem.com/view-pool/4a0629ff-aff9-4ba0-aadc-62451f405d79)

2. What was the gist of your statement of purpose (like did you talk about accolades or less than favorable stats)?

3.what was your ACCT 1 and 2, pre-cal, Micro and/or Macro, & BUSN 300 grades

Thanks guys, also congratulations!!

Conflicts with Withdrawing,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/1g67x37/conflicts_with_withdrawing/,9,16,2024-10-18 02:29:46,"I'm conflicted whether to withdraw or not. 

I'm a mechanical engineering student. Third year, transfer. I'm struggling with two classes: Calculus III and Thermodynamics. I'm not making the C I need so far, and I'm worried. 

I'll admit that I haven't been studying like I should. I plan on remedying that by working my ass off to get good grades on the last two tests I have for the classes (one of those is the final). 

But should I just withdraw? I've never done it before. I'm willing to put in the work, but what if I don't end up doing well on those last two tests? I've never faced this sort of challenge before. The closest has been getting a B in Calculus II. I've got A's in everything else. 

Any advice is appreciated. 

Update: Sent an email to my advisor about it. My thermodynamics teacher already sent me tips on how to do better on the next tests, and he seems to really want me to succeed, so I think I'll keep thermo and try my hardest on it. I emailed my calculus III teacher about study tips as well. "

I was almost going to get paid parking and everything... but then I got worried about leaving my job, leaving from friends at my old school and the diversity at uga. When I took a tour there, I felt kinda out of place, because I'm not a typical Caucasian person or a black individual from a wealthy background. I'm a black individual who grew up low-middle class, so it was kinda hard for me to relate to most uga students during the tour there. My uga advisor informed me that I would basically would have to start over again and my graduation date may be 2027. I was okay with having a delayed grad date, but I didn't like how UGA doesn't offer online courses especially as a CS major. I also tried to change my major to cognitive science but when I found out that they don't get a graduation ceremony-- I didn't like that. I got overwhelmed trying to prepare balancing my work and school life, so I ended up just staying at GSU. I was relieved to be back at GSU until, but recently I've been feeling some guilt about changing my mind about transferring. I could see my life being VERY different than from what it is now. I could've had more opportunities at UGA than at GSU.

I wish that I had thought to offer him a ride up to the fair for the tail end, as I was going to pick up my husband. Even my 14 year old said he looked discouraged.

Dropping out?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/1fl3iya/dropping_out/,91,86,2024-09-20 04:09:05,"TLDR: I'm lowkely miserable and not sure what to do. I felt like writing my thoughts down and maybe am hoping for a new perspective/ someone to tell me to shut up.

Sorry in advance for this ramble/rant but idrk what to think or do. I‚Äôm a fourth year (absolutely NOT a senior) engineering student. I switched majors and then flunked/withdrew from classes in the degree a few times. Calc 2 took 3 tries on it's own. So I‚Äôm far behind. Like I‚Äôm in classes with mostly sophomores and juniors. My one engineering friend is in a similar boat to me, but he completed a minor and had multiple huge internships and hasn't flunked. I‚Äôve done absolutely nothing.

I did zero research on colleges in high school. My senior year was the year after that virus and I was pretty braindead. I applied to ""sensible"" schools and opted for UGA because it was in state and convenient. I only got in because tests were optional. Then i swapped to engineering because it seemed stable. But what good is any of that if I can't make it through the program and am spiraling out of control. I suck at math, and have always had a better aptitude for language or history based classes but I thought I wouldn't be taken seriously if I got one of those degrees. I've seriously been considering dropping out, at least temporarily, and rethinking what I want for myself. But I keep feeling pressured by the modern ""career"" rhetoric to build a resume and network and use linkedin and stuff. I also don't want to dissapoint my parents, since they have basically payed for everything Hope hasn't, and I feel like dropping out would be insulting to them and I don't want them to feel like I've been wasting their time and money. (I have)

I‚Äôve tried joining clubs and they never seem to stick and I can never manage to fit in how I feel like I'd like to. Especially in freshman/sophomore year. Like anything from bird watching to the radio station or nerdy stuff like videogame/anime clubs. Engineering ones too, but I always feel so stupid compared to these prodigies who are super involved with everything. The imposter syndrome is crazy. Theres only one club that sort of stuck that I‚Äôm in now, but most of my friends graduated and it feels like the others in it look at me like some sort of alien. So I‚Äôve stopped going to that too. I went to a really small high school so I'm a bit of a case when it comes to social stuff. Super bad at keeping new friends around/interested in me. I feel like I've watched way to much tv and over-romanticized college. IDK what I expected being an engineering major. Despite all of that I am a completely different person from when I entered college, and wish i could do things over with what I think I know now.

Most days it‚Äôs all I can do to submit the homework for these 3 measly classes I‚Äôm taking. But even though I‚Äôm out of class by 2 at the latest, I‚Äôm sitting at my desk until midnight bouncing between different apps on my phone and driving myself crazy procrastinating because I don‚Äôt know how to do any of the problems. I'm not talented and don't have any hobbies I'm good at or passionate about. I read a ton of comic books and play videogames to forget that I'm a huge loser.

I've never felt like this before. I coasted through high school, and have never really seriously considered my mental health before but right now I feel horrible. I've been pushing people away and just rotting in my apartment. On one hand I feel like I shoudl just keep buckling down and get through it, but if that's what I've sort of always done, will I ever feel any different?

If anyone has any insight or suggestions I would greatly appreciate it. I would also appreciate a kick in the ass and someone telling me to take a long walk off a short pier. I'm gonna go to sleep after posting this so I can wake up to stare at the wall in my 8 am later this morning."

After my transfer, I found it really difficult to make friends. Although I am not completely friendless I really, really want a larger circle because I am very extroverted.

I feel really bad because everyone else seems to be having a fun time going to parties and getting into relationships and doing cool shit.

The one recruiting students & young professionals here is **South Grove Church.**

They especially target freshmen, transfers, foreign students, and anyone alone or new to the city under 30. They use students to lure students & young professionals to lure people from work. They intentionally avoid ""churchy"" language and tie you in relationally via LOVE-BOMBING & ISOLATION tactics. They hide their abusive controlling practices and beliefs, and the fact that their Network President is S.M.@Joshua Church in Austin, who SA'd a child.

The fallout has been massive: derailed careers, financial & labor exploitation, controlled member-only dating, no autonomy, isolation, shunning, ex-communication, cutting off family, and a mental health crisis resulting in suicide.

\*\***Another edit:** I will not be attending UGA, based on these comments... Many people here are downvoting me for pointing out how little UGA pays their grad students, and that there are much better offers elsewhere. I personally think you're mad at the wrong people. You deserve to be paid more and the university should be taking better care of their students. Anyway, best of luck, and apologies if I offended anyone.

Hey everyone, I'm looking to apply to UGA for a PhD but first would like some insight into the quality of living and the housing situation.

I've seen a couple of numbers thrown around for what the current stipend is. The lowest was about $20k, which is offensively low for a Californian. For comparison, my current doctoral program pays $47k.

People keep saying the cost of living in GA would be *so* much cheaper, but I checked out some apartments in Savannah on Zillow and it's honestly not that much better. I'm paying $1750 for a studio apartment in CA right now, which means about \~45% of my income is going to rent.

Zillow says that 1 bedrooms in Savannah are around \~$1.2k. If the monthly stipend is only $20k / 12 = $1600 (without considering taxes), that means 75% of my pay would go to rent. That is abhorrent. Is that correct, though? I saw somewhere else the stipend could be \~$32k, but that's still a massive pay cut for me...

Obviously renting with roommates is an option, but I've just been in school for SO long. I have definitely paid my roommate dues. I'll compromise if I have to, but if I can't get an offer where the ratio of rent-to-income is at least what I have right now, then it's a hard pass for me. Any insight is appreciated."

If you don't know about UGArden, the farm serves as a food hub that not only grows and donates over 15,000 pounds of food each year, but helps move about 2,000 pounds of food into the community that would have otherwise been wasted or thrown away each week during the semester. The farm also distributes and helps grow all of the veggie starts for all of the school gardens in Athens-Clarke County for free. Every year over 1000 UGA students move through the farm as volunteers, interns,  and student workers. Those are just a few of the many ways the farm helps support the UGA and Athens community, so please vote and tell others to vote for UGArden!"

Important bus information ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/1eq0yot/important_bus_information/,139,17,2024-08-12 01:13:58,"I know some people have discussed this here before, but as a bus driver who started as a student, I thought I should share some important information about our transit system. While this is primarily for new students, there are a lot of students who go through here and never learn any of this.

*If you are uncertain about anything, ask the driver; however, they may not be able to respond if the bus is in motion, so it is best to ask when the bus is stopped at a bus stop or red light. 

*UGA.passiogo.com (formerly routes.uga.edu; now a redirect) is more accurate for tracking the buses than the UGA app.

*The cameras and microphones are on at all times. Anything you say or do will be recorded. 

*Scooters, motorized skateboards, one wheels, and anything motorized, with the exception of wheelchairs and other mobility devices required for medical purposes, are not allowed on the buses. 

*Buses can only load and unload passengers at designated bus stops. This is for safety reasons. If you ask the driver to unload elsewhere, you will be denied.

*If a bus's destination sign is flashing ""Out of Service"" in between a route name, that means the bus is going out of service in the next 30 minutes and you can still ride to the last stop. It is not actually out of service until the sign reads ""Not in Service"". 

*If a driver sits at a stop for a few minutes without moving, this is usually because they are ahead on their route, and need to let the other drivers get spaced out better. This often happens after class breaks and other episodes of heavy traffic that messes up spacing.

*During class breaks and other peak times, buses become VERY crowded. If you are standing on a crowded bus, you should take your backpack off and move towards the back. The bus cannot move until all passengers are behind the standee line.

*If you need on a bus that is about to/starting to pull away from a stop, wave at the driver (or their mirrors if you are behind the bus), and they will usually stop and let you on. If they don't, it is probably because they are having to watch the road in order to safely pull out into traffic. This happens very commonly at the Arch and Main Library. 

*Buses will occasionally go off route in order to maintain spacing. The driver will usually notify the passengers in advance, however, and ask if anyone needs any of the bypassed stops before proceeding. 

*While drivers do have to take breaks, they are not supposed to do so during class breaks unless it is urgent. 

*Stop requests are unnecessary, except for on Night Campus, Prince Milledge, Weekender, and a few stops on Health Sciences, Vet Med, Riverbend Connector (formerly Greenhouse Shuttle), and Milledge Avenue. If a stop is on demand, the annunciator will announce ""please signal to exit"" or ""please pull the cord to exit"" in advance.

*While buses are required to stop for pedestrians, they are also extremely heavy, and can't stop on a dime. If you are approaching a crosswalk and see a bus approaching, don't cross. You might as well be walking in front of a train. 

*Which brings me to my next point: ALWAYS stop and look both ways before crossing a street. The electric buses are very quiet, and especially hard to hear if you're on your phone or have earbuds in. If you cross a street without looking (especially if it isn't a designated crosswalk) and get hit, the bus driver will likely not be at fault if they are driving safely and obeying all traffic laws.

*If you are riding a scooter, bike, one wheel, etc., do not cut right in front of a bus, especially if the bus is in motion. 

*If a bus is closed and pulling away from a stop that you need, do not make physical contact with the bus to alert the driver if it is already in motion. You could be seriously injured or worse. 

*Cars, bikes, scooters, and any other vehicles are NOT allowed to pass buses when they are stopped in road on a two-lane. While people do it all the time, it is extremely dangerous.

*If you have to exit the bus and cross the street at a location without a crosswalk, do NOT cross in front of the bus. If a car decides to (illegally) pass the bus, you could get hit. 

*Food and drinks are not allowed on the night routes after midnight. This is because the smell causes passengers who are drunk to become nauseated and throw up. If someone throws up on a bus and any of the contents get outside of a garbage can or bag, the driver has to remove all passengers and take the bus out of service. 

*If a bus's destination sign says ""Help! Call 911!"", this is a distress signal that is used during the event of an emergency where the driver is unable to radio for help. We have never had a situation requiring this feature to be used, and if you see it, it was most likely activated by accident. However, you don't know that, so you should call 911 just in case it is a real emergency. 


UPDATE: The ""Out of service"" message has been replaced with ""This bus ends. Ask for last stop"" and ""Last bus"". The former means that particular bus is going out of service and other buses will remain on the route. The latter means the entire route is going out of service for the day."
