What the actual hell is up with The HUB (and UW) upcharging basic food? WAKE UP STUDENT GOVERNMENT.,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1gwj6a4/what_the_actual_hell_is_up_with_the_hub_and_uw/,87,40,2024-11-21 16:22:31,"I'm at the HUB market looking for a snack/breakfast for class, and inflation appears to have hit especially hard here. This is robbery, what the actual hell? $10 for a burrito barely the size of my hand? $6 for bags of chips? $5 for regular sized Gatorade? $6 for tiny yogurts? 

[look at these prices](https://imgur.com/a/N6EyPPo)

The HUB is meant to be the building for students, by students. These prices do not serve or support students, especially those who aren't financially stable. 

What is our student government doing? Aren't they literally headquartered at The HUB? Then again, why would they care if they're using 70% of their 1.7 million annual budget on their own salaries lmao.

Either the food sells well and students are being upcharged up the ass, or plenty of food goes to waste due to the ridiculous prices. Either way, this is terrible.

- I tutor organic chemistry full time, it‚Äôs not a hobby or side-gig. When you book with me, you‚Äôll be working only with me, not random people at an agency.
- You‚Äôll be learning problem solving through organic chemistry, which you can apply to many other subjects.
- Your learning will be customized to your specific needs 

Before booking a lesson, let‚Äôs chat about your needs, my teaching style, and what you can expect, to see if we‚Äôd be a good fit together. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to working with you!

Question about Transfer Application ,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1gtp7n7/question_about_transfer_application/,2,2,2024-11-17 22:13:41,"Hey all, 

I am a transfer from a WA cc applying to Foster for Autumn 2025. Since the major is capacity constrained and requires a separate application (in addition to the UW general admission application), I was wondering if since I won‚Äôt be completing my Foster pre-reqs before the time I‚Äôd be submitting my transcript for UW‚Äôs general app (but before Foster‚Äôs application deadline), I was wondering if I am able to send in an updated transcript when I‚Äôd apply to Foster, a couple months after I‚Äôd turn in my general application. 

Thank you! "
Experience with running start?,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1gtdcvw/experience_with_running_start/,11,19,2024-11-17 13:17:56,"So I am a sophomore thinking of going to Udub as a WA resident and running start is quite popular. It's enticing due its low cost, and fewer and later classes. But I'm worried I may not do amazing and I'm looking for some experience. For context I'm looking to do engineering and I'm currently in alg 2, ap enviro science, band, Spanish 1, modern world history, and normal English. And I'm a pretty big procrastinator and I'm great at doing homework consistently. I'm just able to get all As anyway so I never have to worry about it. But I worry with RS being more ""independent"" I may fail at getting all my work done and I don't want my grades to tank. So I'm looking for experienced individuals on the subject."

so far the argument for cutting ties that i‚Äôve been able to deduce is ‚Äúboeing money comes so that they can influence the content in the engineering programs and so that they get a platform for hiring the student body.‚Äù the UW aero program seems like a very textbook aero program, and there aren‚Äôt any classes even tangential to weapon development (imo). boeing honestly pays new grads shit, at least in comparison to other companies, so that doesn‚Äôt seem to be a thing either. the aero program wouldn‚Äôt be anything without boeing money, and a lot of student run research labs wouldn‚Äôt have as much support. 

i am really interested in broadening my perspective, i would love to hear other or deeper arguments, because i‚Äôm just frankly confused, as cutting funding would hurt students long before it would hurt the giant company.

edit: guys we are on the same team :(

edit 2: attacking me for being in aero isn‚Äôt helpful. i am going to work in space exploration and commercial space. i guarantee that i have thought more about my role in MIC more than you, i will not contribute to weapon development."

I've emailed my school counselor on what steps I should take from here.

I'm a 2nd year PhD student here at the UW and am looking for people to climb with at the new UDistrict SBP location. I like the social aspect of bouldering but most of my friends are too busy with PhD stuff to climb as regularly as I do, so I'm hoping to find some people to climb with from time to time. Down for literally any day of the week post 5-pm, and weekends any time post 11am. Fremont is fine too as I like their setting.

I generally climb at the orange/black level, but I'm comfortable just focusing on purples/oranges some days and can do an occasional blue. I'm open to climbing with anyone (undergrad or grad) and am pretty fresh out of undergrad myself (23 years old rn), so I'm not that much older than y'all undergrads. 

If you're interested feel free to DM me or leave a comment and I'll message you instead. Thanks for reading and good luck on the rest of the fall quarter y'all.

You can be matched for your retirment plan. That‚Äôs great but I am needing the extra income now. Previously, I was offered $18/hr, 40 hours a week and it only amounts to 1.2k every two weeks, which was about the same or less than the previous job, which was at $15/hr for same 36-40 hours a week.

The Gross Amount could be 1.8k, but the net amount or take-home pay is 1.2k.

Also they make you choose a PERS plan and you cannot change it. Very confusing. I remember searching for hours and days on end as to which plan to choose. I only found one or two video in WA State PERS plan, as of 2018-2020. 

Well, I understand preparing for the future and so the PERS plan is beneficial in that sense. But I would like to take control of how I plan that for myself‚Äînot be forced to pay into it.

Unless I am understanding the PERS plan incorrectly and the whole system of paying into the retirement plans, please enlighten me.

As I currently understand, it‚Äôs pool of money everyone pays into so when our generation gets old we can get this money to help us when we are no longer working (retirement age). Similar to social security, but how much you get depends on the number of hours you‚Äôve worked for public service entities (eg. public schools, etc) and other factors outlined in the plan you chose specifically.

Urgently need help picking major at UW as prospective student.,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1gnpnlt/urgently_need_help_picking_major_at_uw_as/,2,35,2024-11-10 01:43:36,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm trying to figure out what major to apply for University of Washington. I'm an instate student, and UW is my top school.  I'm planning on pursuing a pre-med/pre-vet track, but I'm not interested in taking a traditional route of biology or public health. I'm more interested in taking a major such as tech/math related such as informatics , applied mathematical science with data science, stats, or even econ (cs and engineering is super competitive so I'm not even bothering). I know doing this makes it much harder for me to get into UW, but my parents are adamant on me only pursing majors like this.

I really need advice on which of these majors to pick, since I'm super scared of the acceptance rate for these programs, on top of them being capacity constraint programs. Does anyone have any advice or knowledge how   competitive these majors or what major I should consider picking? Everyone at my school is scaring me on how competitive it is.

If I don't get admitted into these majors directly, how hard is it to get these majors as a premajor student? I've heard informatics is pretty brutal. Is anyone else taking a nontraditional path for premed, and have some advice?

My current plan was maybe to apply for informatics as my first major, and then Biology as my 2nd major. I'm worried that's a stupid idea since my backup major is also a capacity constraint major.

Apologies for the lengthy rant, but I‚Äôm feeling really stressed since I haven't been able to get proper advice from anyone. Going out of state is tough since my parents aren‚Äôt  willing and don't like UW Bothell that much. In addition I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm the most competitive applicant.

Thanks"

1.

Then on this page (3) [https://admit.washington.edu/apply/transfer/spring/](https://admit.washington.edu/apply/transfer/spring/) that I found just by searching ""uw transfer spring quarter"" it says THE ONLINE APPLICATION IS OPEN where the word open is a hyperlink that takes the user to [applyweb.com](http://applyweb.com) where indeed it seems like there is an online form that you could fill out and I guess submit application to UW this way. Great. Now, if you open this form and actually try to fill it out you'll notice that there is no option to choose a second-choice major (third screenshot). Ok. But on (1) it says quote:

**APPLY TO THE UW - S**EATTLE USING THE UW TRANSFER APPLICATION (BY DECEMBER 15 FOR SPRING OR FEBRUARY 15 FOR AUTUMN) AND LIST CS or CE AS YOUR FIRST CHOICE MAJOR

The words ""list CS as your first choice major"" imply that you could choose some other major as your second choice major. Well, why isn't that option present on [applyweb.com](http://applyweb.com) which they refer the user to then (again, third screenshot)?

Besides, it says on (1) that virtual Transfer Thursday Drop-Ins are held weekly on Thursday from 2:30 to 3:30 pm on Zoom (fourth screenshot). I skipped a class on Thursday just to find out that it wan another piece of out-of-date information, because the session never got started.

I don't want to be a bitch. I just want to apply for Spring quarter and do it safely, being sure that I've done everything correctly, in the right order, using the right forms, etc. Usually, to do something safely one would refer to the official website of whatever the organization and use their manual. But given how many contradictions and unreliable out-of-date pieces of information I found on UW's official website on the span of just 3 (!) web pages, I don't know if I can trust it anymore. What if, for example, the deadline for Spring quarter general admissions application to UW is actually November 15th but they just forgot to update the information from previous year and left it as December 15th (by the way, that's what my classmate told me - that they were told by a UW advisor that application for Spring actually DOES close on November 15th, so now I'm twice as worried knowing full well that the information on UW's website can't really be trusted). How do I know that they hadn't forgot to update the deadline info if they've forgotten to update their info in so many other places?

Isn't all of this pretty crazy, really?

I realized there was no tool that shows which roads are good for skating, so I decided to build one.

skateable allows you to simply click two points on a map and rate the smoothness and the safety of the road (or trail/path) between them. You can also view other people's ratings of existing routes and update them if you feel they're incorrect (such as when a road has recently been paved).

On their official website it looks like one would first need to apply to UW and then apply to Allen School.  
But I've also heard that if one lists CS as their first choice major, then their application to UW is passed through as their application to Allen School as well. So not only they would NOT NEED to apply the second time, but they also would NOT BE ABLE TO submit a different application for Allen School than the one submitted to UW."

The problem is that I have zero experience in the work I‚Äôm interested in. I‚Äôm pursuing Geography Data Science and would like to work in the public sector doing something with GIS/data. 

Some context: I‚Äôm 20s returning student, and I technically have sophomore standing, but credit wise I can graduate next year if I take a couple classes in the summer. This is my first quarter back (after almost a decade away) so the only remotely relevant classes I have are stats and geog which I‚Äôm taking now. I‚Äôll be taking CS and GIS courses next quarter. Do I just apply and list skills I‚Äôll gain this year rather than skills I currently have lol?

For financial aid reasons, I really need to graduate next spring, so staying through my senior year and doing internships the summer after isn‚Äôt an option unfortunately. "

I‚Äôm aware they do not consider our main common app essay, so I was wondering if that would extend to the common app‚Äôs additional information section? Should I try to condense my add. info down to 200 words and paste it there? I tried emailing my admissions officer and she hasn‚Äôt responded (it‚Äôs been 10 days), so I am slightly worried.

My only other question is that when on the final portion to review and submit, it asks if I would like to include my personal essay from the main common app (optional). I thought this wasn‚Äôt considered at all? Would including an additional essay help my application at all, or would that penalize me?

In general, our lab recruits adults who stutter and adults who do NOT stutter for a variety of experiments in which you'll be compensated $20/hr. We can reimburse for street parking and we will provide you with a free hearing screening as part of the experiment.

Most of our studies involve sitting in front of a microphone and reading words or sentences off a screen. Some studies involve measuring your brain function while you wear an electrode cap (just like a swim cap). We have various safety protocols in place to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

What's CSE431 typically like? Is it a lot of work? From previous course offerings, it seems intense, but i'd love to hear some anecdotes about it. Similarly, how's 341? I'm dead-set on taking CSE421 next quarter, so really, I'm choosing between 341 and 431. I am incredibly passionate about the content in both courses, so it is really a difficult choice...

The website says you can either take ACCTG 215 Financial Accounting & ACCTG 225 Managerial Accounting OR ACCTG 219 Essentials of Accounting. Is it worth taking 215 and 225 or should I just take 219 to get through the prereqs faster?

Amenities: It's a studio, about 250 sq. ft. with a full-sized fridge, dishwasher, in-unit washer/dryer (combo unit so you can just press a button in the morning when you go out and it's done when you return), oven/stove, and a microwave.

10 minute walk from campus, a couple blocks from the ave, very close to the 372 & 67 (and <5 min from U District Station & the U District link stop)

It also comes with a small table and a queen bedframe. Also since I'm leaving the country I can give you some of my stuff if you want it. I have a big Ikea shelf, a queen mattress (a pretty good one, I think it was 600 new which was 8ish months ago), a full set of dishes, etc. "

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm hoping to get some insight into my chances of getting into UW and specifically the Foster School of Business (finance major). Here‚Äôs a bit about my background and stats:

Academics:

	‚Ä¢	GPA: 3.06 (Upward trend after struggling in freshman year due to immigration challenges and adjusting to a different curriculum.

	‚Ä¢	AA in General Studies (Running Start)
	‚Ä¢	AP Courses
	‚Ä¢	Running Start Program
	‚Ä¢	Part-time work and volunteer experience
	‚Ä¢	President of a book club

Extracurriculars:

	‚Ä¢	Student Council (freshman year in Cambodia before moving to the U.S.)
	‚Ä¢	ASB (sophomore year)
	‚Ä¢	Volunteering: I‚Äôm actively involved with a Khmer nonprofit advocating for human rights in Cambodia as a newsreader, participate in protests, and volunteer at a Khmer temple.
	‚Ä¢	Ran an e-commerce business for half a year for experimental purposes
	‚Ä¢	Upward Bound
	‚Ä¢	Helping Cambodians transition to America by connecting them with agencies/programs and translating

Since the deadline is a month away, I‚Äôm done with my personal essay and revising my supplemental. I‚Äôm also happy to send a personal DM if you would like to read it or have advice!

Ok, so I had an atrocious 1st year, failed math 120, and 111. Ended up doing math 111 at a CC and passed, and currently taking math 112 during fall. I just now, as of last week founding out that I‚Äôm not a Arch design major, I‚Äôm in the general- I was directly admitted so I assumed that also meant I was directly admitted into the Arch Design major. A sweet girl in my class had mentioned she was kinda in the same boat and is taking her calc rn at a cc, in my head I was like why? Just for the challenge? She said it‚Äôs required to get into the arch design. 

I had THOUGHT that I only need to do math 112 and then I will be done with my worse enemy, but since I‚Äôm NOT an arch design major, I will need to do Calc 1 in order to even apply right? Am I understanding this correctly? 

So my only time to be able to do that is winter quarter at another CC, which my the grace of god I can pass the 1st time around. 

So my question is, is calc one 100% needed to apply and be considered for the major, or is it a possibility to finish it once I get accepted? Thoughts? Prayers? suggestions?

I don‚Äôt understand how someone can become so chronically behind everyone else, why is school like this, I‚Äôm so done with not knowing shit about shit.  "

Yes, that means you may have to walk a few more steps to your destination. Don't worry, I heard exercise is good for you or something.

This isn't just a matter of convenience - it's an actual safety hazard for cyclists and other Lime users. It's very easy not to see a wheel or a handlebar sticking out of the bushes and collide with it. The Burke-Gilman gets very busy around campus during commute times, surprise obstacles don't help.

Let me put this in car terms: the Burke is like I-5 for cyclists, e-bikers, and scooters. Would you block a lane of I-5 with your parked car because \*technically\* people can get around it? \[if you said yes, you're wrong\].

I know this post is probably a waste of time, but I don't know what else to do about this. I already report the scooters to the Lime app, which doesn't seem to do much, at least in the short term. When I have time, I move the scooters out of the way, but there's just so many.

The plan is to finish my Geography Data Science degree, but if my application into Informatics gets accepted, I have to decide between a few options.

Option 1: Informatics + Study Abroad (graduate on time

Option 2: Geography: Data Science + Study Abroad (graduate on time)

Option 3: Double major in Geo + Info + Study abroad (graduate 1 or 2 quarters late)

Option 4: Double major + no study abroad :(

I've completed so many Geography requirements that it feels like a waste not to finish the degree, but I REALLY want to study abroad. I feel like my college life has been relatively boring as I've commuted since freshman year, and want to do something new. It also feels like a waste not to pursue informatics if I don't get into it, as it was my original preferred major. Is it worth graduating later just to study abroad? I doubt I will be able to transfer many credits over as the requirements for both degrees get pretty specific at the upper levels. What option would you guys go with?"

How does Washington State CC Transfer work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1g2m244/how_does_washington_state_cc_transfer_work/,3,18,2024-10-13 09:41:03,"According to the Transfer By The Numbers page on the UW website, Washington CC transfers have a 69% acceptance rate, with a middle 50% gpa range of 3.24-3.85. I will be finishing up my AA at Cascadia through running start this year and I expect to end up with a 3.75 GPA there. I‚Äôve been told that getting an AA gives you an even higher chance of being admitted as well. 


Based on that information, I believe I have a good chance to get in when I apply. With that being said, I‚Äôm concerned about the capacity-constrained major system. My intended majors would be Informatics, HCDE, or Stats, all of which are pretty competitive. Does the prioritization of in-state CC transfers boost my application chances to my major, or does that just help me get into the school itself? 


And as far as similar, non-competitive majors go, I was looking into Geography: Data Science since it seems to be the only major close to what I want that doesn‚Äôt have a <30% acceptance rate. I am somewhat interested in geography, but I‚Äôm not sure that the degree is technical enough, along with it not giving me a whole lot of options career-wise compared to my other preferred majors."

**TL;DR For Previous Posts:**¬†Applied to Foster twice with a low GPA and didn't get in. A lot more goes in to it, but that's the gist of it. Did two internships, rejected both return offers. Going all in, full speed on my pipe dreams. Also got rejected from Husky 100.

**TL;DR For This Post:** You can't not read the finale in full.... but if you insist, >!I got into one of my top choice programs!!<

Before we get into the season finale, quick GPA update since that's what I applied with: We moved up to 3.1 and that's where it will be when I graduate!

As promised 7 months ago, I am making a final update on this ridiculous saga as I near graduation this academic year. Last time I said I'm going to do two things before the next update: Study for the GMAT and apply to grad school and I'm happy to announce I did one of those!!!

I ended up not studying for the GMAT for a number of reasons but I also got waivers from all the schools I was targeting.

But before going into my application results, something that I think I've never explained is that by the time I graduate this academic year, I would have exactly taken 180 credits since leaving UWS with probably an average of 3.9GPA which is an entire degree on its own not including the 100+ credits from UWS. This is something that I really tried to highlight in my applications and whenever I had chats with people from admission prior to submitting my applications. So when you see the results bellow, it's helpful to have this context in mind.

**Onto what everyone is here for:** I never said what programs and schools I'm applying for because UWB has maybe a few hundred business students in total and even less graduating this academic year. So, I'm really trying not to dox myself which is impossible if I give away the names of any programs I'm applying to. I guarantee you there is a grand total of zero people from UWB applying this year to any of these programs/universities and possibly even ever, because in all of my LinkedIn searches I have yet to see a UWB Business Alumni at these schools. Also, considering that obviously a LinkedIn post is incoming from me on my acceptance, I'm trying to limit my exposure here. So as much as it pains me, I will share with you the school's ranking in my specific program instead of naming them. Although, ranking them is a bit complicated but I won't go into that because nobody cares!

But I'll do this. I'll write the schools ranking based on US News MBA Rankings for the said schools just so we have a standard baseline and I will also write the specific programs ranking because I'm not getting an MBA. For Reference, Foster MBA is Ranked 27 this year in US News.

*PS: Foster MPACC isn't on this list incase anyone was wondering. I didn't apply and they release decisions in March anyways because they don't have rolling admission.*

**Similar Programs** (Main Focus)**:**  
Top 20 MBA - #1 Program Specific: Waiting  
Top 25 MBA - Top 3 Program Specific: Accepted  
Top 35 MBA - Top 10 Program Specific: Waiting  
Unranked MBA - Top 10 Program Specific: waiting [edit 2: Accepted w/ $$$]

**Adjacent Program**  
Top 10 MBA - Top 3 Program Specific: Waiting [edit 1: Accepted]

Yes, I only applied to top programs becausen I knew those would be the ones with the highest ROI based on career outcome reports for each school. My philosophy was that I'm not taking out 100 bands in loans and spending it on a Masters out of the goodness of my heart! The time and monetary investment had to make sense and it only did at the top programs where I thought I can leverage the degree into landing something worthwhile. The main reason to pursue a masters for me was recruiting power and all of these schools release employment reports which tells me two things:

1. It's good enough that they are willing to put it out there and;
2. I can see what percentage of students can quickly get jobs following graduation, in which industries, and where most students go geographically and use that to see if that aligns with my goals;

I also reached out to recent grads at every one of these schools on LinkedIn to get a better idea of each programs strengths and weaknesses.

Honestly, when I was initially applying, I wasn't too sure about my chances at any of them. Obviously I was hoping to get into the #1 program, because of it's... ranking and great career outcomes, but also because (being vague) at some point during the last 4 years, I got to spend a few weeks at the campus getting to know some of the faculty and students and it was great!

I decided to post this before the other decisions come out because I already go into one of my top 2 choices and the ‚Äúadjacent program‚Äù although is at a better university, its a different program that I‚Äôm less excited about. 

**Here is what worked for me (and didn't):**

*The things that worked:*

* I think, overall, my essays were strong. I told my ""story"" effectively in my essays, and I took advantage of optional essays to explain my complicated transcript situation and undergrad journey. I spent a lot of time on them and got feedback on them from a couple of people as I was working on them.
* Of course, the upward trajectory in my GPA was a plus, but I think having essentially enough credits for an entire degree with virtually perfect scores after leaving UWS and explaining that effectively won me some decent brownie points. Because I literally went through four years of undergrad again.
* My previous two internships, although unrelated to my desired industry post-gradschool and likely very common amongst other applicants, were still quiet decent, especially the second one, which was at a well-known large company, and I think I tied my experience at those internships quite well into my motivation to switch into a different industry and my goals post-graduation. Every time I mentioned the second internship in calls with admission, it bought me some credibility.
* Talking with students admission ambassadors about their experience at the program. Besides being able to get specific info from them that I was able to use in my essays about the program, I think they play a (very minimal) role in the application process as well so it's somewhat helpful.

*The things that didn't work:*

* Of course, going ""back"" to UW (Bothell) hurt me quite possibly a lot. Had I gone somewhere else after spending a year at CC, I would have had a brand new GPA with a 3.9 or a 4.0 right now instead of a 3.1 and every time I explained this to an admission person before applying I could practically hear them scream in pain for such a missed opportunity.
* Not taking the GMAT - Yes, all schools waived it, even the ones I didn't end up applying to because I don't need to anymore, and I still got in to all of the ones I did apply but I also did limit my options as well. Who knows, maybe with a high enough GMAT I could have been competitive for one of the handful of Ivys that offers similar programs. I also got incredibly lucky with one of the waivers that I got. I had zero business getting a waiver from that school because I spoke with the director twice over the last two years, with the second time being at the beginning of this summer and he indirectly told me I should take the GMAT and without it my application would be incomplete but right before applications opened I chatted with him again and they decided to waive it.
* I'm not sure if my ECs in clubs and research experience mattered at all. For one, it never came up in any conversations and my interviews, and although I was able to leverage those experiences to write some of my essays that had unique prompts, I feel like they generally carried very little weight. This is actually in contrast with my job interview experience, where those ECs are literally all I used to talk about in interviews for my two internships, lol. I do, however, have one EC that has nothing to do with UW that I think actually had a lot of impact as well. 

*PS: Just to be clear, getting a test waiver doesn't mean you are automatically accepted. It just means they think you'll still have a chance in the admission process without a test score so they are willing to still review your application along with all the other candidates.*

**Closing Thoughts & School Choice:**

I think I've rambled enough in a post that nobody asked for. Due to reasons that shall remain undisclosed I haven't decided what I'm going to do but if it comes down to it, obviously going to go with the *first* program. It was always my dream to go to that school and I could not be happier about it. I have some friends who go to that school for undergrad and it would be cool to graduate with them in 2026 and I also know quiet a few faculty there as well from my visit to the campus a while ago.

That's it for me! Sorry I didn't make the cut for janitor at McDonalds, maybe next year (If you know the reference! - PS.: I didn't even apply!)

Thank you to all the people who read my 5 novels and rants over the last 3 years. There were so many times over the last few years that I was *millimeters* away from just giving up and saying screw it! I can't say it doesn't feel good to go from getting rejected from Foster twice to getting accepted to multiple masters programs better than Foster (*take that UW!*)

But, considering by the end of my masters I would be in school 5 years more than I would have been had I just not messed up my GPA to begin with (and all the additional student loans and lost income on top of that), somehow all this effort doesn't feel like that much of a win after all!

Best of luck y'all. Try to not be me...! :)

Sincerely,

I was thinking about attending UW (possibly Seattle, but I'll look at Tacoma & Bothell) next fall, and I've been conflicted about housing. 

I'm currently in CC student housing. I don't like it, mainly cause the building itself seems to be poorly maintained, the doors slam incredibly loud even if the student just lets it go gently. It gets so annoying because it literally shakes the floor. I've been also annoyed because the dorm room is poorly maintained. A lot of things are broken. I'm also not very keen on roommates, I much prefer to have my sleeping space to myself as I am a very light sleeper. 

The only issue with apartments it maybe difficult to get somewhere close as I don't have a car. I've heard also it's difficult to get studios in UW Seattle.

The New Rotunda Isn't Working,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/1fvgnfk/the_new_rotunda_isnt_working/,28,8,2024-10-03 19:56:05,"I miss the sandwich kitchen. Ever since students came back, the soups and refrigerated shelves have been picked clean long before my lunch break. I don't think they ever get restocked during the day. And with the cafe on the 4th floor also closed, there is actually nowhere else to go. Maybe I'm a little hangry writing this, but I also don't understand why they closed down all the freshly-made food places in the first place.

I can still see all the kitchen equipment behind the makeshift convenience store wall. What would it take for HFS to reopen the ""real"" rotunda? Or are we just doomed?"
