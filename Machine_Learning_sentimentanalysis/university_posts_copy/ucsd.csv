Tips on how to crush your first quarter at UCSD!,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1floits/tips_on_how_to_crush_your_first_quarter_at_ucsd/,95,24,2024-09-20 22:34:59,"Hey all, I wanted to share some tips for the incoming class here. Hope it helps! (I was in Revelle, Argo dorms)

**1. Get Organized with Digital Tools**

One of the biggest challenges you‚Äôll face is managing your workload. Staying organized is key. Tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) were lifesavers for me. They helped me keep track of classes, assignments, and all the extracurriculars I was juggling. Sync your calendar across devices so you never miss a deadline. The sooner you get in the habit of using these tools, the smoother your quarter will go.

**2. Leverage Campus Resources Early**

If there‚Äôs one thing I regret, it‚Äôs not using campus resources sooner. Your school offers amazing support like the writing center, career services, and mental health resources. Don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre struggling ‚Äî start using these from day one.

**3. Stay Connected with Campus Activities and MAKE FRIENDS!!**

Getting involved in campus life will enrich your experience and help you build connections. There‚Äôs a lot more to do than just Sun God! Whether it‚Äôs joining a club, attending events, joining Greek life, or just getting to know your peers, staying active is crucial. Download [Circles Verified](https://circlesverifiedapi.com/), an app that keeps you in the loop about everything happening on campus. I found out about so many cool events and clubs through it that I would‚Äôve otherwise missed. Also, check out all the other colleges on campus and dining halls (great place to make friends by just sitting with random students!)! (Pines in Muir is the best)

Don‚Äôt let your college years go by without making the most of it. A hack for making friends freshman year that I did: knock on every door in your dorm and invite everyone to go to the beach at night! I made my closest friends this way on the very first day. Remember that everyone is looking to make friends just as much as you are!!

**4. Network with Professors and TAs**

One of the best pieces of advice I got was to make an effort to get to know my professors and TAs. They‚Äôre not just there to grade your work, they can be valuable mentors and connectors for your future. Don‚Äôt just show up during exam season. Make attending office hours a regular thing. You‚Äôll be surprised at how much more you can learn and the doors it can open. TA‚Äôs on campus hold a lot of power especially if you‚Äôre in Revelle and have to take the humanities courses!!!

**5. Prioritize Mental Health and Wellness**

The pressure at a top school can be intense. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the hustle and forget to take care of yourself. But trust me, your mental health is just as important as your grades. Make sure to use CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) for any issues you‚Äôre having. They‚Äôre extremely helpful and the counselors are truly amazing. Apps like [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) and [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) were my go-to for managing stress. UCSD used to offer free access, so definitely check that out.

Tools to Help You Succeed:

* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/): For organizing notes, tasks, and schedules.
* [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/): To keep track of your classes and deadlines.
* [Circles Verified](https://circlesverifiedapi.com/): Stay updated on campus events and activities.
* [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) or [Calm](https://www.calm.com/): For managing stress and maintaining mental wellness.

Final Thought:

You‚Äôre about to embark on an incredible journey and some of the best moments of your life. Best of luck this quarter! üçÄ

Where to print glossy business flyers?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1gwr4ce/where_to_print_glossy_business_flyers/,2,2,2024-11-21 21:40:03,"I wanted to print glossy business flyers for my business (idea). Does anyone know any good places where I can get this done for cheap? I have no clue what prices for printing are, especially for glossy flyer size prints and I don't want to get scammed. It'd be great if someone could tell me how to get there too cause tbh, I have barely been off campus (I'ma  freshman.)

Also, is it bad idea to put my personal phone number on the fliers? I can't afford to get another number but I'm scared that putting my number could potentially lead to a dangerous situation if someone decides to harass me? Ik this is unlikely, but I want to play it safe. And I probably only want to do this until college. Would putting my own number make it difficult to get away from this in the future (Or in a few months if it doesn't work)?  
Lastly, if anyone has experience with this, what's a good way to distribute flyers off campus? Ik it's illegal to put stuff in people's mailboxes and paste it on public walls, etc. Should I just leave them on cars, etc? Again, as I'm not well acquainted with the city, what would be good residential areas to go to for this? Would these places be accessible by trolley? I feel so lost on how to approach any of this."

I am in council, my friend in AS ranted about this to me and I did some digging. This account is anonymous to hide the identity of me and her.

I‚Äôm sure a lot of you have seen the drama with AS and are probably over it by now. But it‚Äôs important that students know WHY the budget is so screwed up this year. The Leslie slander needs to stop.

There is almost always some screwup when passing the budget. But this time was more serious.

The issue lies with the CFO (finance person) of AS who completely blundered the budget. To be fair, AS was already coming into this year with a deficit, but CFO Jacob‚Äôs lack of transparency made things 100x worse and now most of AS wants him out.

* He didn‚Äôt oversee the hiring process during the summer. In result AS ended up hiring too many advisors
* He didn‚Äôt ask administration for accurate numbers when drafting the budget. Then lied about the mistake.
* He didn‚Äôt communicate anything to AS or the public for over a week after the blunder
* He wasn‚Äôt strict enough about cutting office expenses. He also increased the budget for offices and orgs he is personally involved with.
* When the president and VP External were taking heat, he disappeared instead of taking responsibility.

Leslie should not be falsely blamed. Nobody should. Especially when it has consequences for their careers.  I hope that during the meeting tonight we can hear an apology from the CFO to Leslie and others.

Please don‚Äôt send any personal hate to the CFO or the President. Keep everything in this discussion.

I get allergic reactions to a lot of meds, especially psychiatric ones, so I can't afford to do that. Is there any other way I can participate?

Is it a good idea to directly email faculty doing research on fmri and volunteer. Perhaps that way I could get an fmri of my brain and also get to learn more about fmri scans and how to analyse them in general? However, I'm not sure if this is a practical option cause I'm a freshman and don't have any experience with research studies, research or fmri in general.

best biz econ double major,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1gwpzmr/best_biz_econ_double_major/,1,1,2024-11-21 20:52:33,"I'm considering doing a double major in biz econ + something else. I'm a bit confused about what would be a good second major to do along with biz econ tho. What would be a major that when combined with biz econ helps widen my job prospects once i graduate? Ideally, I'd like to go into finance. But I'm open to other corporate jobs as well.

I was also wondering if it'd be a good idea to do an unrelated but somewhat secure major as a double major. That way, maybe it won't help widen my prospects if i wanna apply to finance or something biz econ related, but at least it'll be a solid backup to fall back on. (Cause I don't trust a biz econ degree and don't wanna solely rely on that, especially in this economy and job market. But in general, these kind of jobs are just too dependent on the economy, so I think it's necessary to have a backup) In that case, maybe EE would be a good option?

What do y'all suggest? Idc if the second major is hard or doesn't have a lot of overlap with biz econ as long as it widens my prospects or provides security and stability."

Overwhelmed by organic chemistry? Assignments and tests creeping up on you and feeling like you‚Äôre in hot water? Or maybe you‚Äôre doing well and need that 95%? Whatever your struggle with organic chemistry may be, I‚Äôm here to make sure you succeed. 

Why work with me? 

- Every tutor knows the subject, but not every tutor knows how to transfer that knowledge to a student. I do. 
- I tutor organic chemistry full time, it‚Äôs not a hobby or side-gig. When you book with me, you‚Äôll be working only with me, not random people at an agency.
- You‚Äôll be learning problem solving through organic chemistry, which you can apply to many other subjects.
- Your learning will be customized to your specific needs 

Before booking a lesson, let‚Äôs chat about your needs, my teaching style, and what you can expect, to see if we‚Äôd be a good fit together. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to working with you!

Circadian Rhythm vs 8am Classes,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1gvt8xl/circadian_rhythm_vs_8am_classes/,0,13,2024-11-20 16:19:31,"I have had my fair share of people warning against taking 8 am classes. Why, though? What is wrong with these earliest classes?

High schools also start at around the same time, sometimes even at 7 am. In general, it is safe to assume that college students have completed high school before. In that case, how are 8 am classes torturous when they in fact start an hour later?

One common behavior prevalent amongst young people which I have noticed over and over again is their terrible sleep schedule, often going to bed only after midnight. I am not trying to judge or dictate how people should live their lives, but consider this: is this natural?

Before the invention of lightbulbs, our ancestor only had candlelight to illuminate them after sunset, which made activities at night impractical. Instead, they took advantage of the darkness and rested while their hemisphere of the Earth was facing away from the sun.

Today, we are constantly shined by artificial light, especially the glaring LEDs from our devices. Our extensive usage of screens affects our circadian rhythm. While our predecessors would go to bed a few hours after sundown, we stay up until late. Hence the growing population of people sleeping after midnight.

Nature has granted us approximately 12 hours of total darkness to rest without any brightness disrupting us, yet we reject this gift and sleep as unnaturally as possible. Consequently, we must endure the repercussions; people constantly reliant on caffeine, less-than-present students in 8 am lectures, lasting exhaustion throughout the day, etc.

Ultimately, there is nothing wrong with 8 am classes. It depends on how you live your life. If you can manage to attend them without relying on a cup of coffee, you are on track to a better lifestyle."

This guy hacked one of my closest friends insta accounts and asked me for money. I sent him 50 cause I the friend in question would send me 100 dollars, no question asked.  Then this dumbass scammed messaged me from his personal insta account, claiming to be my friend. I realized I got scammed and pretended to believe it was him. Then, for the past 2 days, I reverse imaged searched his photos and found info like full name, what high school he graduated, family and their names, and other stuff. I didn't do anything cause a slimmer of hope that it really was my friend, but today the scammed blocked me on insta. Then today I emailed him about this, and I pretty much asked him for the money back and that I was gonna do something (that is not physical harm). I then sent him pictures of his family, siblings, and pictures of him as a kid. Then I gave him till Wednesday to send at least 30 dollars back.  He then replied to me that he didn't know what I was talking about. When it litterally is the same email that I sent Zelle money to. People of UCSD, what should I do?


TLDR: I am stalking the guy who scammed me for 50 bucks and he claimed he doesn't know me when I pressed him.


Update 1: I told his mother about it and she blocked me. I 100% imagine she told him that I am lying and just trying to get money so that wouldn't work. I then threatened him with legal action. Well the guy sent me ten dollars and told me to fuck off so I did get something but I still got info on him so I reported him to the CCC and zelle. which he can actually get into legal trouble with cause I know his full name, phone number, and email. Now, Imma do petty stuff like sign him up for stuff. Also I might make flyers with the 10 dollars and say ""call and make seal noises for chance of 100 dollars"".

Save the Santee Drive-in. OMENS. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1guadn3/save_the_santee_drivein_omens/,33,2,2024-11-18 17:34:56,"Hello UCSD. This is OMENS. 

On May 25th of this year, our student run art & music collective hosted our first ever music festival at the Santee Drive-in movie theater. We featured over 20 UCSD artists, bands, and dj's; all put together and organized by your peers. 

The festival was a major win for our local community and for our organization.

Sadly.... 

the historic drive-in theater property threatens to be destroyed. Our mega-corp daddy, Amazon, wants to demolish the property and build a 300,000 sqf distribution warehouse in its place. 

**OMENS has started a petition to protect the property as historical landmark.**

[https://www.change.org/p/save-santee-drive-in](https://www.change.org/p/save-santee-drive-in)

Historical Landmark Designation would protect the property from any adverse development and give another chance to create the community hub the drive-in always should have been. 

Although recent policy and administration changes have been disheartening.

*We can create, change, and protect culture, together, right here.*

Check out our petition to read more on the specifics of our issue. We already have thousands of signatures and just need a few more.

You can also check out the story abc news did recently.   
Thanks guys.

**Cons:** no more Geisel library

**Pros:**
1. Casinos are cash cows. UCSD could generate enough revenue to lower tuition, and allow the price center and the Wong Avery library to run 24 hours. 

2. Immediately solves the Geisel funding crisis. Geisel relies on university dollars in order to operate. The casino would practically pay for itself. 

3. It would also add tons of jobs for students. The casino would need dealers, slot attendants, surveillance officers, cashiers, hospitality staff, servers, bartenders, security, chefs, maintenance, etc.

4. No more ‚ÄúUC Socially Dead‚Äù. We‚Äôre literally gonna have an entertainment hub in the middle of the campus running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

5. Instantly makes us the most iconic UC, leaving UCLA and UCB in the dust.

Mike started getting slower and it was lowkey depressing but our champ didn't get knocked down once and stayed every round. Even taking 72 punches as a 58 still hella impressive and he would have destroyed if he was 27. This win for Jake don't make him good cause he couldn't knock out a 58 year old. He prolly finna dig up muhammad ali for his next fight cause he sucks. This fight lowkey motivated me to train really hard so I can beat jake paul to when he is 58.

Should you do a research project or something like that with a professor in your final year to put on your resume the fact that you have some experience in the field even though your major is different? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I'm only planning on staying longer so I could use all the resources provided from UCSD to help me with my resume and career in the future. I don't have much to put on my resume, I didn't have an internship or really previous jobs (I hear back from one most likely tomorrow so hopefully I get that lol), but I really want to expand that and have a decent/solid resume for when I graduate so I could potentially have a job lined up for me after or just to even have more things on it so by the time I graduate I have more opportunities for me.

I am a complete beginner, I barely started making my linkedin account, looked at handshake, career center, etc. So basically what I'm asking is for advice on all this stuff. With, (hopefully if I do get accepted to get my minor), one year left up until summer, what should I be doing? What do you guys suggest I should be doing to make the most of the time I have left? Thank you!

TLDR;  
Graduating hopefully by summer if minor gets accepted, want to better my resume and experience. What's the best thing to do within a year before I graduate to help with that and just any advice for me?"

Is College Worth it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1gplap8/is_college_worth_it/,3,6,2024-11-12 13:57:37,"I hope that maybe someone out there can relate or offer advice, or even share stories of a STEM pathway or of alternate pathways. My journey through school has been a mix of experiences. I did remotely well in community college, even working as an organic chemistry supplemental instructor for a year. But as I learn more about autism (recently diagnosed) and navigate college life, I feel like I‚Äôm experiencing skill regressions that make everything feel harder than before.

I recently transferred to UCSD, and my first quarter was rough‚ÄîI actually failed it because the shift to a new school and environment was overwhelming. I took winter quarter off to regroup and reached out to the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), got into therapy, started medication, and put together a support system. By spring quarter, I managed to scrape by with passing grades, and I felt hopeful that I‚Äôd finally get back on track. I‚Äôm also on academic probation because I failed my first quarter out of the two I had that academic year, which just adds to the stress. Everything (I feel) depends on my Financial Aid (my insurance, mental support, and housing specifically) and I don‚Äôt get any financial support or any support from my parents so that adds to my stress.

Fall quarter started strong. I felt inspired and happy to be back, and things looked like they were finally going to improve. I was doing so well in my other classes. But then I ran into an issue with a professor over my accommodations. I‚Äôd arranged with the OSD to receive handouts and slideshows before class so I could process and prepare for real-time discussions. I get overwhelmed by all the sensory input in the classroom, so having some time beforehand helps me feel more grounded and able to contribute with my group. However, my professor insisted this interfered with the ‚Äúactive learning‚Äù structure of the class and only allowed me time after class to submit work.

I tried to compromise and even offered not to receive answers on the slides‚Äîjust the questions‚Äîso I could mentally prepare without disrupting his course. But he refused as he used iClicker questions and handouts as formative assessments, and OSD ended up siding with him. (If you want to hear more about this, I‚Äôm still debating if I should keep fighting or get legal involved.) My medical professionals were shocked by this decision and tried to advocate for me, but it was emotionally exhausting so I kinda declined. I started having autistic meltdowns more frequently, and eventually had to let go of the fight because of the great toll it took on my mental health and my other classes. I was struggling to keep up with assignments and submit work on time because I was too busy just trying to recover. It feels like if nothing will get better anyways, why fight? I feel like I‚Äôm doomed to accept that I‚Äôll be getting constantly overwhelmed and exhausted over one class anyways. I just want to pass this class and do well in my other classes and fighting feels so much on top of my inevitable fate. However I‚Äôm so behind and exhausted that I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll even pass. 

The whole situation has left me feeling demoralized. I‚Äôve never had a professor refuse my accommodations before, but now I worry that this might become a recurring issue, especially in STEM. I feel like I‚Äôll be constantly fighting just to get basic support, which feels incredibly discouraging and exhausting especially since OSD doesn‚Äôt seem to want to advocate for me. I don‚Äôt know if I want to live my life in a career that demands this much constant advocacy for equity, especially when it seems like STEM fields don‚Äôt always understand or empathize with disabled people. I receive a lot more humanity from humanities fields than I ever had in STEM. (Besides my OCHEM professor who was the only STEM professor willing to support me pre diagnosis). STEM is already competitive and being disabled gives me such a disadvantage.

I‚Äôm realizing that I may not even be passionate about my major‚ÄîI‚Äôve just stuck with it because I was good at it. And I know I can make it if I just had more support. But maybe there are other paths where I could thrive without enduring so many autistic meltdowns and constant battles. Besides, I never enjoyed school. I always felt like I had to put in more effort and work just to catch up with an average college student who‚Äôs also putting in a lot of effort and work already. With accommodations it relieved a lot of stress, but I still struggle a lot. I can‚Äôt turn a blind eye to that struggle at this point and without accommodations it‚Äôs even worse. I‚Äôm meeting with my therapist currently to discuss this, but I would also just like to see if someone has been in a similar situation and what they are doing now.

Thanks for reading, and if anyone has advice or has been in a similar situation, I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing your thoughts."

But there are also some heinous, cringe people here that are actively trying to cash off on other people's miseries and trying to be 'funny.' I've seen a person **repeatedly** making fun of the person that recently passed away, saying how they tried to disrespect gravity and boohoo they lost. What kind of monster are you? Do you not realize that even as a non-student, they were someone's baby and a living being with a family?

And before you go to the comments and call me out for not confronting them, I did this time. I called them out and reported the comments. Because they went on to make more inappropriate sex jokes in genuine posts and it just makes me so sad and I can't stand this anymore. This post is not intended to dox anyone, but please, I urge you all, if you have nothing good to say, don't say it. This is a difficult time that we live in, and even with different political views, I think we can all agree that it is a great tragedy that someone passed away.

We know just how tedious it can be to figure out what classes to take, know what to first pass, and find the perfect schedule, so we created the Triton Student Enrollment Assistant ‚Äì TritonSEA! It's a website by UCSD students, for UCSD students, that will make your life easier and reduce your 20 open tabs for enrollment down to just 1.



Here are some of the cool things it can do

* Import your degree audit and get personalized class recommendations
* View stats and enrollment information for classes in previous quarters
* Make your schedule and 4 year plan
* Search and filter the UCSD catalog



We are currently labeling this a ‚Äúbeta test‚Äù, we will continue to support the website and make updates throughout the year. If you notice any bugs or would like to request new features please join the [discord](https://discord.gg/HS2F3n7QJd), link can also be found at the bottom of the website!



*DISCLAIMER: Using TritonSEA won‚Äôt enroll you into the class itself, only webreg handles actual registration.*

Good luck with enrollment everyone!

Another red flag is that he insist on me getting back to him asap and when I asked about having a tour before taking other steps in the applications, the guy said that you apply first with the documents and ‚Äúreference checks‚Äù (wtv that means) before they give you a tour.

All in all, if the rent cost is too good to be true, that should be a MASSIVE RED FLAG to anyone. ALWAYS make sure to ask for a tour before doing anything else.

It‚Äôs better than Blue Pepper in my opinion. This time me and my friend opted for the Kids Pad Thai with Chicken as our protein, and I went and got us some veggie spring rolls on the side. The plate is generous for being a kids meals and costing 7.50$ USD, and the spring rolls are cheap, but don‚Äôt taste like some other nasty cheap spring rolls i‚Äôve had before. They‚Äôre crunchy, and the vegetables taste fresh which I really respect for the fact that they‚Äôre big and literally only 1$ USD. I also really liked that they even had these kids plates which are almost like trial size versions of Thai classics for affordable prices which is why this place was so effective at getting me to try Thai food. The very first time I came here another friend tried the Pad See Ew and he said that was really good, and it looked yummy so I‚Äôd also recommend that if y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt really feeling it w the Pad Thai. We paired everything with some Iced Mango Black Teas which were really refreshing, and I loved that they weren‚Äôt overwhelmingly sweet. I‚Äôve had their limeade before and honestly it‚Äôs also really good and fresh with a strong citrus flavor and more sugar than the teas for sure. They also have all kinds of canned sodas, and they offer generously large cups of cold water as curtesy. My total was literally 14.55 plus tax, my friends was like 11 something so like you really can‚Äôt beat that kind of price in today‚Äôs San Diego restaurant food scene. It‚Äôs also such a cute spot with really chill vibes and I‚Äôve come here to eat and study with some friends before. Idk, I really love it and I think you guys should know about it.

I have a situation where my SLR has been denied and i‚Äôve lived here in california for the past 2 years onto my third now here at ucsb. I completed ccc and got an associates degree. Before I came to california, i did a year of community college out of state and all those credits were accepted by CCC and they gave me equivalent credit. 

The requirements for the AB540 is to have 72 credits ( 3 years of coursework) from a california community college and a degree. Which i have had 57 from ccc and got credited an additional 30 from my out of state cc. 

Will these credits I got credited for from my out of state cc count towards this 72 credit requirement? 

I am conflicted because it‚Äôs technically like i did take them at CCC but not fully. Please let me know if you have any insight or if you went through a similar situation."

1. We can see what your resume file name is
2. PDF format makes your resume much easier to review 

Some of y'all have deranged file names üòÖ I personally don't mind funny file names (so long as I can still tell who this resume belongs to) but a few were straight up unprofessional and made it harder to match it to the profile I'm reviewing. Safest bet is still just some combination of {full name} + resume (optionally +company you're applying to). 

AFAIK PDF is still the easiest, since a lot of times it opens in whatever app is used to review. The couple of docx files either were annoying to open and review or worse got mangled, forcing me to wait until i finish other work before coming back to review on the computer.

Obviously the reason you get thru or not will still be based on ur qualifications and experience (unless maybe you're that one guy that used a slur at HR staff in the file name? Not sure what happened to himü§î). This is honestly more for my own sanity and probs won't be guaranteeing anyone a job üòÖ

However, I was told we received over 3k resumes for like only low double digit spots?  I'm personally going thru them on my phone omw to the office having worked overtime till 11:30pm the night before debugging a new feature that needs to be deployed ASAP.

-Is UCSD really dead socially? I really know what dead can look like as I attend a community college, It can be really bad lol.

-What is the psychology department like? Are the professors supportive and well informed or do they suck?

-What are the classes like? are they small or are they large? Will you be able to interact with the professors without having a huge line of other students?

-What are some things to do outside of campus that would be fun with friends or alone?

-What is the campus like? is it fun? are there things to do? How long does it take to walk to classes, that kinda stuff?

-If you are an extravert could I find success making friends and going against the stigma of UC socially dead.

Is is worth choosing this school over some of the other UC‚Äôs or even the other schools in the area/cali

-I have heard the academics are top notch, is this true?

-Does the college offer recourses and people to speak with to make the college experience easier and help with networking and making yourself more competitive?

-And finally what are some things I should do when applying for UCSD that would separate me from the crowd and push me ahead.

Why is UCSD sticking with the Tritons as the mascot?  Why not Koala Bears?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1glvmy7/why_is_ucsd_sticking_with_the_tritons_as_the/,61,40,2024-11-07 17:16:42,"Alum here, Muir Class of 1977.  Back when I was there, a small group of students wanted to change the mascot to the Koalas.  The logic is simple - UCB has the Bears, UCLA has the Bruins, UC Riverside has their Scotty Highlander bear, so maybe UCSD should be the Koala Bears.  Much more suited to match the student body personality - laid back, sleepy looking half the time.  The San Diego Zoo has a world renown koala exhibit, and the campus has so many eucalyptus trees (or at least did while I was there), prime habitat for koalas, not to mention the suspiciously similar-to-koalas-looking Bear rock sculpture.  That original group of students even had t-shirts made up featuring K. Wally Bear.  

UC Santa Cruz's student body overrode their administration's ""Sea Lions"" mascot in favor of the [Banana Slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Santa_Cruz_Banana_Slugs#Mascot), why can't UCSD come up with something more interesting than Tritons?  Are Tritons being kept solely to honor the original Scripps Institute role in the early years of UCSD history, when Scripps is now a small part of the much larger university community?"

SIO Major Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1glwnk1/sio_major_advice/,0,0,2024-11-07 17:58:57,"Good morning everyone, I'm a second-year student looking to switch into an SIO major and would love any and all advice!

I'm currently deciding between OAS and ESys (EBE), and I know these are pretty disparate majors in SIO but its mostly because I don't really know exactly what I want to do -- I just know I want to work in environmental research/industry. My reasoning is to either choose a more specific major that I'm really interested in like OAS or stick with something broad like ESys and explore specific topics through other opportunities. The thing I'm struggling with is what I'm more interested in -- I would say I'm more well versed in biology and ecology (used to be pre-med), but I also find topics like biogeochemical interactions and climate of the ocean and atmosphere very interesting. My question would mainly be for people in both of these majors. What do you like/dislike about them? Do you think someone who is a little behind with physics and math courses can still catch up and be satisfied in OAS? Any and all input from every SIO major is greatly appreciated!! Thanks!!"

CSE course load suggestion?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1glvarj/cse_course_load_suggestion/,1,2,2024-11-07 17:02:33,"I'm currently taking CSE 12, 21, and 29 in my first quarter. For winter, I‚Äôm considering enrolling in CSE 100, 101, and 30, which seem to build directly on the topics from this quarter. However, I‚Äôm a bit concerned about the potential increase in workload as I move into upper-division courses. Could anyone share insights on the programming assignments and overall workload for these classes? Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot!"

Now I have to take WCWP 10A, Math 10A, Chem 6A, and BILD 5. I feel like it's too much. I plan to first pass WCWP and Math, but I'm wondering if I should just pick either chem or BILD, or suck it up and take all 4. Chem and math are kicking my ass this quarter."
