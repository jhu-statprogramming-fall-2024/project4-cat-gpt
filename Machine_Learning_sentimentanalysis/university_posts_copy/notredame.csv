Should I even bother even applying?,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/1gweswe/should_i_even_bother_even_applying/,9,13,2024-11-21 12:10:41,"


I will start by saying I’m not a high school student. I am 22 years old and am a military veteran

high school
Grades- I went to a small private catholic school in new jersey which was a very good school within the state, but not like the northern prep or boarding schools. I was a sold A and B student in honors with a few IB classes sprinkled in and a few College prep classes. I maintained a 92.5 gpa on a 100 scale

SAT- I took it and did very poor but my scores expired since it was 4 years ago and ND is test optional 

Extracurriculars - I was a four-year varsity swimmer, which I went to states for and won and was a captain. I also was a club swimmer also played varsity football for three years which we also went to states for two times, but we didn’t win. I was in theatre and my school choir. I am an Eagle Scout. I worked as a lifeguard during my summers and even competed in statewide competitions, I even competed in a Red Bull one once. That last thing set the tone for what I did after high school

Post high school - I applied to Notre Dame and naval Academy and unfortunately did not get in high school, I had about 15 other schools looking at me, but it did not feel right. At 18 years old I enlisted in the United States Coast Guard. During that time I took college classes to prepare myself to go back to college

Military career- I enlisted at 18 years old fresh out of high school which feels like ancient history now. Went to basic training in New Jersey, not far from my hometown when I graduated, I was sent off to my first unit in Florida. I eventually went to a training school to become a boatswain mate, which is a person that is an expert at all things seamanship and performs almost everything but flying. Throughout my time, I have conducted numerous search and rescue missions, chased drug runners and captured billions of dollars worth of controlled substances, helped to rebuild the south after major hurricanes, played the key roll in the illegal immigration crisis and maintained major navigational systems for major ports from Alabama all the way to Miami, and maintained lighthouses.

In my free time I volunteered at horse ranches for unwanted horses as a caretaker because livestock is something that always made me feel close to home. I got big into scuba and spent some time volunteering at my church

Why I want to get in so bad- ND was something I had been obsessed with my entire life. I grew up in a very devout Catholic family, but never really got into it until I joined the military. When I joined the military especially in the beginning I was depressed and hated myself everything because all my friends where I college living their life and I was in the middle of the ocean chipping rust. I started going to church more because I reminded me of home and I haven’t looked back. I really want a school where I could wear my faith and it aligns with my values I feel that it would be the right place for me but I doubt I am the caliber of person especially compared to most of the people who post these things. I would love to do ROTC and gain my commission. I have emailed the person who runs it and they said they would be willing to write a letter of recommendation for me. I would love to major in history with intent to go to law school. "

thinking abt leaving- transfer experiences?,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/1gveksf/thinking_abt_leaving_transfer_experiences/,20,10,2024-11-20 02:03:18,"I am a sophomore transfer and am thinking about leaving ND next semester. I am a non-legacy from a very different financial situation than most of my peers. I have one close friend but do not feel happy without more people and I haven't found that especially given that there is not much to do off campus-even bars are not consistent for sophomores. Most transfers live at the 87 so I haven't met those people and the clubs I joined met infrequently as I am not an athlete/musical theater person. It feels like everyone just loves it here and nobody has a different experience and I don't really see a path to meet people (my dorm is big and isn't known for their culture). I would study abroad next year but just don't know if I can wait until then and I've heard that can be clique-y too. Also if I transferred I would go to an in-state school which is obviously a step down academically and career-wise so I am very torn.

Considering MBA ,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/1guat9h/considering_mba/,5,9,2024-11-18 17:52:35,"Hello All,

I am interested in applying to ND's MBA program in a few semesters, and am interested in some advice and what my chances might be.

My undergrad is in Mathematics, but my GPA is quite bad; 2.38. I graduated in 2011.

Since then:

*  I have served in the US Navy for 6 years. While serving, I operated, maintained, and analyzed three nuclear reactors. Two of these reactors were on an aircraft carrier (I deployed twice) and one was at a DOE site. 
* I've completed four classes at San Diego Community College where I obtained all A's.
* I've completed two data science and machine learning bootcamps.
* I have four years of professional experience as a data scientist; two consulting for myself (which I've considered making an official LLC), and two at a SAAS company.
* I'm currently attending Georgia Institute of Technology for my Master's in Computer Science specializing in machine learning. My current expected graduation date is Spring 2026. I currently have a 3.0 GPA.
* I'm currently a machine learning engineer for an IT services and consulting company.
*  I have been on a missions trip to Dominican Republic, as well as participated in other charity events.

Why Notre Dame:

* For four or five decades my family has followed ND and ND football. It started with my grandfather who, while never attended, was a huge ND football fan and donated some thousands of dollars to support ND. He passed away from lung cancer in 2002.
* I applied but got reject for my undergrad in 2005 and for a Master's in 2021. ND has been a dream school of mine for probably 25 years.
* I will have benefits left over from my GI Bill after I finish my current Master's, so I thought, ""this is the time to apply to ND for a MBA"".
* I have been able to see ND football games five times now. The first three times were in 2015, 2016, and 2017 in California, but these last two I got to go to South Bend to the ND campus. I fell in love with the campus atmosphere and the history of ND football, that I love. For example, seeing statues of Lou Hultz (I watched him when I was a child in the 90s) and Knute Rockne around the stadium, as well as visiting the church and Grotto, left me speechless.

My questions for the community:

* Do you think I have a chance?
* What do you recommend I work on now to help make my application stronger when I apply?


Edit: someone from the MBA admissions responded to my inquiry, ""i think you'd be a good fit. feel free to schedule time for us to discuss""."

I'm also pre-med and I really had my heart set on Notre Dame - I've been thinking about applying to transfer in the spring. I'm highly involved at my current university - I'm in student government, volunteer weekly through the campus church to tutor children at surrounding elementary schools, part of a few volunteering clubs, I'm doing research in a lab, and I'm taking the 18 credit hours (the maximum) and I'll likely get all A-/A's. I really want to transfer to Notre Dame as I loved everything about the school when I toured and I believe it would be better for me to attend a smaller university as opposed to a bigger university (where I am now) because I plan to pursue a MD/PhD after undergrad and I think a smaller school would be more supportive of my research goals and learning. Does anyone have any tips they can offer on the transfer application? Also, I live fairly close to Notre Dame and I was wondering if it would be too imposing or unnecessary to book a meeting with a counselor and ask questions about transferring - would this be a good way to demonstrate my interest or am I better off not meeting with anyone at all and just asking my questions via email?

Clearly, current college students (and their parents) who have recently gone through the admissions process are aware of ND’s grand stature. At the mere mention of our school, their eyes widen with respect, and they eagerly commend us for attending such an elite and selective institution: ""Notre Dame? No way! How did you get in?"" ""Wow, you must be very smart."" ""Congrats, I hope to send my kid there one day."" ""Please. Take my daughter's hand in marriage."" This is how it should be.

Unfortunately, the older, uncultured plebeians of our society are teeming with ignorance. I seethe with godly anger when my family friends don't collapse onto their knees when I mention my college, or when my neighbors question why I would choose to study in South Bend when we have a community college and state school so nearby. Peasants. How can they be so obtuse? How long do you think it will take for the unwashed masses to learn about our illustrious history, marvelous athletics, and academic prowess? 5 years? 10? 20?"

The University of Notre Dame apparently supports the existence of a fascist American movement,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/1gfpkhd/the_university_of_notre_dame_apparently_supports/,0,50,2024-10-30 15:41:33,"https://constudies.nd.edu/events-news/events/2024/11/08/the-2024-jeanie-poole-oshaughnessy-lecture-delivered-by-distinguished-guest-ron-desantis-46th-governor-of-florida/

There is a German saying: If a Nazi is seated at a table with 10 people, you have 11 Nazis.

The University of Notre Dame has invited Ron fucking DeSantis to speak at the University. They are elevating the voice of the insidious fascist movement currently fanning the flames of anger and hate that threatens our democracy. You don't get to say you support democracy while elevating voices of those that are trying to destroy it.

The University of Notre Dame may as well be sitting at a table with a Nazi.

I am ashamed to be affiliated with this University. It's one thing to try and thread a needle avoiding angering either side of the current political spectrum in the US, but it's another entirely to be completely blind to the danger created by promoting such voices. The Republican Party as it exists today has been completely and wholly corrupted by the MAGA movement. To give a platform that lends credibility to these hateful, spiteful people is disgusting. The leaders of Notre Dame should be ashamed.

I'd love to welcome students from all backgrounds — you don't need any prior coding experience. We'll start from the basics and gradually explore Python, working on some real-life coding projects along the way. All of my colleagues teaching this course (Fred, Rob, Xiaojing, and Alison) are amazing instructors, so you'll be in good hands no matter which session you choose. I know most students at Mendoza didn't start out thinking too much about coding in business school, but hopefully this class will give you a good introduction to one of the most important skills in business today. Or even better, maybe spark your interest in pursuing the BAN major afterward.

Feel free to check out my [bio](https://junyuanke.com/) or if you'd like to know more about my [teaching records](https://junyuanke.com/teaching/). I'm also happy to answer any questions under this post about the anything related to this class or the ITAO department.

I chose to serve my time in the United States coast guard. I still would love nothing more than to go to the university again especially since they cover all veterans tuition, and it feels right going back to another Catholic school. My question is that I would be 22 if I get in would that be too large of an age gap and would it hard to get involved and be active in the community?

I’m a low-income international student (Honduran). 

I have a 4.0 senior year GPA and an overall 3.94 GPA when converted, and a 98.5 in my country’s system, 1490 SAT. 

Valedictorian of my class (1/16) and must mention that my school doesn’t count with AP classes. 

I would say decent extracurriculars: various awards at National Math (2x Honor Mention), Chemistry (Honor Mention), and Physics Olympiads (Silver and currently participating one last time). 

I also volunteer as a tutor and trainer for new Olympians in Math (5 hours per week during the last half a year) and Physics (4 hours per week during the last 3 and a half months), was school president and part of the school government for 3 years, and work as a private tutor. Also, planning to apply REA.

Still working on my essay and supplementals but hopefully they ain’t that bad

And I guess I should mention it, I’m a christian and the reason I mostly fell in love with ND is the sense of community the school has and it’s engineering programs.

Plan to apply for either the Electrical or Mechanical Engineering program.

My parents did their PhD in ND and always talked about their amazing time, and when I was 8 y/o I spent it on the ND campus and it was probably the best time of my childhood. I'm also currently a student at the Pontifical University in my home country (Latin America) and I don't feel left out. 

However, I am gay and Jewish (and Latina), so I'm wondering if I'm like too many minorities to be able to have a good time at ND. 
I absolutely adore ND, I watch every single football, basketball and soccer game, but I just think that either being Jewish and/or gay might make me have a hard time.

I hope you don't mind me asking, but I will be visiting the university at the end of October and I was wondering about the location of the university. Is it quite easy walking to the university if I stay at a hotel a mile or two away? The reason I'm asking is that I live in the UK and whilst some of our universities are in the middle of a city (e.g., Oxford, London, Bristol), others are on the edges of the city or in the countryside (e.g., Sussex and Bath Spa), and there is no way of getting to them without transport. Is walking to Notre Dame generally OK?

Questions:
- What would it look like to search for a job with the education that Notre Dame provides? Would employers be less likely to hire since your education is in traditional architecture and not contemporary? 

-What is it like to be in architecture school at your university?

- Does the program at Notre Dame compare with the program offered at Benedictine University? (If anyone knows)

- What should I do to learn more about this field and take steps toward it.

Finally if anyone has advice for me that would be greatly appreciated. Forgive me if I don’t understand anything about the field, I am trying to learn.

I’m an oldie applicant (42) hoping to get accepted into the EMNA program. I’ve been working in non-profits for 16 years and in a director role for 4 years. I never really received formal education related to the director role and often feel like I’m flying by the seat of my pants and learning as I go. I feel like the EMNA program could really help strengthen my knowledge base and consequently improve my work. 

I want my application to be as strong as it can, just like any applicant would. I’m in the process of crafting my essay response, answering the following prompt: 

Tell us about a time, in your personal or professional experience, when you persevered and overcame obstacles or you had to start over and rebuild. What did you learn most about yourself, and how has that influenced how you show up in the world?

I’ve had to scrape through so many personal and professional obstacles in over 16 years of work and 42 years of life, so the content is definitely there. When my son was born severely premature and spent 8 months in the NICU eleven years ago, it fundamentally changed me as a person. I shifted my work to focus on accessibility and inclusion in public spaces, and it’s been a huge force in my life. Is it poor form to delve into an experience that personal? Will the admissions committee view this type of response as a sympathy grab? I’m trying to be as balanced in my writing as possible, not focusing too much on my son and focusing more on the way the experienced changed me — and my work. Do any of you who have been through this before — and accepted — have any insight on how to navigate this portion of the application? Thank you! "

But no, they chose to wildly guess how many students would show up to a free ball, which lead to about half the student body trying fit through one gate.  The line went past Stonehenge, a mob formed outside of the gate as people squeezed past each other to get in, there was a tiny QR code sign to “checkin”, and they only opened other gates after an hour.

My college's deadline to add or remove classes closes today and I had a question regarding the 'course prerequisite requirements'.

I am a sophomore majoring in computer science who currently has a 4.0 GPA, but the thing is, if I come to Notre Dame I want to do ideally economics or something similar. I read the 'requirements' as Macro, Micro, Calc 1, and Calc 2. I am currently taking Calc 1 but other than that I do not have any of the classes it lists. Now I am kind of at a crossroads, I feel like I have three options.

->Take Macro and Micro at the same time, making me have 3/4 of the requirements, however this totally messes with my schedule if I stay at my school, basically taking courses I don't need. For more context, I plan on applying to more than just Notre Dame to transfer, I am not entirely sure what other schools requirements are but I assume they want as many relevant classes as possible.

->Take Macro or Micro, this fulfills 2/4 of the requirements and does not waste any courses if I stay at this college, however the class looks challenging and I predict I won't do the best.

->Take another gen-ed instead of Macro, fulfilling 1/4 of the requirements, I am more likely to get a straight A in another gen-ed, but if my goal is to transfer this semester they won't even be looking at my GPA from this semester's classes until I am accepted.

For more background, I am in Computer Science, but I have only taken two Computer Science classes, the rest have been gen-ed's and writing requirements.

Also, does anyone know if there is someone I could email or call with more details on this situation? I read if you don't meet the pre reqs you have to take them over summer break, but I'm applying in spring so I'm confused on that...

I think later this week I will try to post another thread with my stats and more general questions, it's been a wild past few days though so this is all for now. I really appreciate anyone who took the time to read this and respond."

Thoughts on the Malthusian Trap?,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/1f6yr7u/thoughts_on_the_malthusian_trap/,9,8,2024-09-02 05:10:43,"This might be random given most posts are about social life, but this is an academic philosiphical topic.  

As we know, Catholicism commits to belief in an inherent right to dignity for all plus an intentions based ethics (Thomas Aquinas). Thomas Malthus is the polar opposite of this.  Thomas Malthus was a Protestant thinker who taught that the poor deserve suffering and harm brought onto them basically as a form of population culling and population control, as some form of divine punishment.  He frequently advised deception, malnuroushment and bad hygine for the poor to basically kill them off faster and get rid of them.  His axiom of thought is basically that no one has a right to dignity.  

Here's the thing, Malthusianism is used to argue that the finiteness of resources disproves the possibility that all people can have a right to dignity.  It therefore paves the way to victim blaming and enslavement, and generally justifies eugenics and sadism.

I think Malthus is wrong for his moral charachter, values and behavior.  I think he also contradicts the moral teachings of Jesus, but the one problem is that it does seem true that no matter how wrong it may be to be rude to anyone resources are actually finite and so this seems to be a real problem.  So my question is, what's the solution?  Recycling?  High density housing?  Walkable cities?  I need to hear some opinions on this issue to help myself think about responding to it. "

So I'm going to be honest here: I am a senior and I can count the number of people I talk to on a regular basis on one hand, not considering if we're even considered close.

College has been a struggle for me for a variety of reasons from health to personal. I've really tried to put myself out there, make the first move per se, keep relationships and conversations going, but it just hasn't seemed to stick. I think a big part of my struggle is because while many would probably assume me to be an extroverted person just by talking and meeting me, I'm an introvert at heart. I'm not much of a partier (at least not the sloppy kind, I really do love throwing a good themed party or cocktail/dinner party!), but I do love the Notre Dame traditions. It feels like a lot of people are in the two extremes (and both of them are fine!), but finding the middle ground has been hard and I think that's made it even harder for me to find people for me to really click with.

After a tumultuous four years, I am dedicated to having a good senior year. But as the first games approach and I have no one to go with and conversations are struggling to gain steam, I'm just gonna put myself out there: are there any other lonely seniors out there? Or am I really the only one? Because as the first game approaches, I'm ashamed to say that I have not a single person I could go with. 

I love a good coffee or cocktail and love going on short little adventures. I love modern historical media (we were robbed of My Lady Jane season 2!!!). I love 70s music and jazz, recently obsessed with Laufey! I also adore my sweet, sweet orange tabby who is my only roommate off campus. In general, I like to think I am a good person and try to be the friend to others that I search for myself. So if this resonates with you, please reach out and lets grab a drink or something. Or lets make our own little club because no one should be going through their senior year alone."
Why is the Hesburgh-Yusko program award stuck at 25k?,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/1f479m0/why_is_the_hesburghyusko_program_award_stuck_at/,20,17,2024-08-29 16:48:33,"When The Hesburgh-Yusko Scholars Program was established in 2009, the award was 25k a year. Tuition  was $36,340.

Now the award is 25k .. and tuition is over 65k

  
The Yusko family gave 35mm to the school to fund the scholarship. And they pay out about 2m a year in scholarship dollars. Since the S&P average return since 2009 has been 14.92%, an average portfolio would throw out over 5mm a year over this period. (And ND has access to funds the retail market does not).

  
Why not double the scholarship to 50k, putting it more in line with the 2009 gift.

  
I think ND makes more on this money than it pays out. While retaining the halo effect of ""giving""."

First Year Advice from a Washed Up Alum ,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/1f3stot/first_year_advice_from_a_washed_up_alum/,49,9,2024-08-29 03:30:52,"
I wanted to make this post a bit earlier before school kicked off, but thought it would make sense with students (mainly freshman) being halfway through their first week. I obviously don't have all the answers for making friends and being social (and am a few years removed from school), but as someone who also stressed a ton about friends (and had everything workout) I thought I would offer my top 3 pieces of advice for making friends as a first year: 

1. Relax

I know, not the most mind blowing piece of advice out there, but it really is true. The first semester of college feels like a sprint with so much ""newness"" going on. New schedule and routine, new classes, new room (probably living in a new state for most people). You get thrown a ton at you, and it's easy to start to stress and treat every conversation, party invite, bad grade, etc. as a life or death situation if stuff doesn't work out. From my experience, you really don't form your a core group of people until the second semester of your freshman year, and big groups of friends are usually formed due to the ""newness"" factor I mentioned. Let yourself acclimate and get things figured out. It's a totally new environment and it's ok to take your time and ease your way in; I would bet most of the other freshman feel the same way, even if it looks like people have everything figured out. 

2. Put Yourself Out There

Again, super basic advice but it really does work. But, this also doesn't haven't to be anything super scary or intimidating. For me, I forced myself to make an effort in going into open doors and asking people if they had plans, wanted to grab dinner, etc. More likely than not, people are also in the same boat but are too afraid to ask. Funny enough, my friend group (about 10 guys) all met each other because someone had organized grabbing dinner at the dining hall. Try and say ""yes"" to things that you are even slightly interested in. Early season soccer game invite? Go. New club meeting that you might be interested in? Go. You never know where you will meet people you connect with, so try and approach all situations with an open mind, even if it might not be the most comfortable situation; trust me, something good will come out of it. 


3. Let Things Come Naturally

Funnily enough, this is the piece of advice that I had the toughest time with. As a transfer into ND as a junior, I was in an odd spot. It was right during COVID (spectacular time to socialize obviously) and the social scene was a bit more like prison than college. I even did Welcome Weekend as a Junior (which is a whole other story having two years of college under my belt). Still, I remember feeling like everything had to happen immediately or else I was screwed, especially socially. I stressed over every interaction, conversation, dorm event, etc. I couldn't figure out why I wasn't making close friends right away. But, the instant I felt like everything didn't have to happen ""now,"" I slowly started to connect and meet my good friends. If you're doing all the right things in terms of meeting people, you will! It just takes time, and everyone is on a different pace in regard to friends. Allow things to happen at your own pace, and trust in yourself (and God) that there is a plan and place for you at ND. 

*Tip: Go to the game watch on South Quad this Saturday to watch us beat Texas A&M 100-0. There will be a ton of people there, and it's probably the easiest thing to invite people and meet people at. Should be a good game too as long as the O-Line holds up but I digress. 

Congrats to all the freshman on your first week, and I wish you best of luck your next 4 years. It goes by way too quick, so take a deep breathe, light a candle at the Grotto and just chill. If anyone needs is stressed, needs an ear (wants to break down the A&M game), feel free to PM me; always here to lend an ear. 

Best of luck and Go Irish!! "

**Essays/LORs:**

Common app: Not very good but talking about how learning stick shift is similar to all the other challenges I overcame (persistence is key). It's not ""common app"" but when a school asks about identity, I structure it around coming from a mixed household and not knowing what culture to align myself with and how I grew out of that shell and told my culture's story to others and fostered a community around that. 

LOR 1: Economics teacher, not sure how this is going to turn out, initially liked me very very much saying he expects me to be one of, if not the only student to get a 7 this year, has some health issues and I am not sure about the status of what's going on and cannot reach out to him, 9/10 (i expect)

LOR 2: English teacher, absolutely adores me and my writing, think's I'm very creative and out of the box, likes how I get everyone involved within the class and have a good personality, 8/10

LOR 3: Ambassadorship person from Columbia, met with her in person after touring the campus again, was very kind and our talking session which was planned for 30 minutes became 2 hours, 9/10"

Petition: End Notre Dame's Partnership with Lockheed Martin,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/1evbwna/petition_end_notre_dames_partnership_with/,0,16,2024-08-18 15:26:12,"[https://chng.it/CS575478dy](https://chng.it/CS575478dy)

   
It's a link to change.org. I'll try pasting the text here. On the actual site it has hyperlinks to sources for quotes, numbers, etc.

This is a call for the University of Notre Dame to sever its relationship with Lockheed Martin Corporation, the largest arms-producing company in the world. In 2022, 90% of the company’s total sales were arms sales. In the same year, Lockheed Martin Vice President Steven Walker enthused of the company’s ongoing partnership with Notre Dame that ""University relationships like this are an essential component of our collaborative ecosystem to deliver 21st century capabilities for our customers.""

While Notre Dame’s Master Research Agreement with the arms producer focuses on aerospace research, the continuation of a relationship with this ""trusted partner"" is unavoidably a continuation of support for those ""21st century capabilities"" which Lockheed Martin delivers to its customers—its sales, again, being 90% arms sales.

In particular, Lockheed Martin supplies extensive weaponry directly to Israel—multi-mission aircraft, fighter jets, rocket launching systems, battlefield artillery—as part of an ongoing collaboration expected to exceed $6 billion.

The Israel-Hamas war, in which these arms are currently being used, has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians in 10 months—some 15,000 of them children. This number does not include the thousands of bodies which remain buried beneath airstrike rubble.

500,000 Gazans face catastrophic hunger as a result of arms-related destruction of cropland—razing, bombing, shelling, and heavy vehicle movement—as well as Israeli blockades and the killings of humanitarian workers. Following the destruction of Gaza's sanitation systems, the polio virus—which had been absent from the area for the last 25 years—is now present in the wastewater of Gazan cities, with the first case of the illness confirmed in a 10-month-old child. Nearly 60% of structures in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, including over 80% of schools, leaving more than 625,000 students without access to education.

Notre Dame remains energetically in collaboration with Lockheed Martin, the largest arms-producing company in the world, whose products have actively contributed to these deaths and atrocities. We are calling upon the University to end this relationship. Our research and education must not come at the expense of the education, welfare, and lives of hundreds of thousands.

This issue should be of especial moral gravity to faithful Catholics, whose Catechism holds that

""'Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God and man, which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation.' A danger of modern warfare is that it provides the opportunity to those who possess modern scientific weapons—especially atomic, biological, or chemical weapons—to commit such crimes"" (CCC, 1997, para. 2316).

""Non-combatants, wounded soldiers, and prisoners must be respected and treated humanely"" (CCC, 1997, para. 2313).

The Catechism moreover denies that any war can be considered morally legitimate unless rigorous conditions are met, including that

""All other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective"" (CCC, 1997, para. 2309).

""The use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated. The power of modern means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition"" (CCC, 1997, para. 2309).

In its current and future selections of research partnerships, financial investments, and collaborative relationships, we urge the University of Notre Dame to remember:

""The inversion of means and ends, which results in giving the value of ultimate end to what is only a means for attaining it, or in viewing persons as mere means to that end, engenders unjust structures which 'make Christian conduct in keeping with the commandments of the divine Law-giver difficult and almost impossible'"" (CCC, 1997, para. 1887).

""Each community is defined by its purpose and consequently obeys specific rules; but 'the human person … is and ought to be the principle, the subject and the end of all social institutions'"" (CCC, 1997, para. 1881).

Please sign and share this petition to join in urging Notre Dame to sever its relationship with Lockheed Martin."

Job prospects out of Notre Dame Law School. Especially important for POC/First-Gen.,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/1e0a1pp/job_prospects_out_of_notre_dame_law_school/,0,3,2024-07-10 23:15:29,"Notre Dame Law is a highly ranked school, full of respected academics, and great job placement numbers: about 80% of their graduating class either goes into BigLaw or a federal clerkship, and a great showing of public interest activity. For any applicant, this looks like a school that would be great for their career.

It isn't.

Please don't come to this school if you expect this school to support you in becoming a practicing attorney. This is a school that has an administration that doesn't care to support its students, and places extreme amounts of stress on them. If you don't have the connections to get a job out of law school on your own, this place won't help you. If you're a person of color, you will be subjected to racism at every angle, including when looking for career advice. If you fall into both camps, you're done before you walk through the door.

The Career Development Office can be politely described as ""well-meaning but under-resourced"". In reality, they're failing. On private sector hiring, they've consistently missed the massive shift towards early legal hiring when giving students advice, leaving students who didn't have connections to give them a warning or a leg-up stranded. Those students could resort to public interest, but alas - there is no one in the office who knows the public interest sector. The person who filled that role was let go a few years back, and the remaining personnel don't know enough to give students substantive advice. IrishLink, which is the portal for job applications/OCI, is a nightmare that is mainly consists of USAJOBS scrapes and zombie-postings of old jobs that are no longer available. Ranking for OCI bidding just became available this year, a system that has existed at every other law school of this caliber for years.

Furthermore, they're not helping students make connections. If the CDO at Notre Dame has active connections with firms, they're not utilizing them, and aren't showing any evidence that they actually have any connections. Several large firms (500+) this year have complained that they'd like to get into contact with NDLS's Career Development and meet students, and they've gotten nothing back. The situation is showing no signs of improvement - in-person networking events have all but disappeared after their post-COVID return, and for the very first time, Notre Dame Law did not advertise a ""Meet the Employers"" event in 2024. Whatever the reason for Notre Dame's high job placement numbers, it isn't the Career Development Office.

Notre Dame Law likes to credit their famous nation-wide alumni network for that achievement. But there isn't one. There's a small Notre Dame network in its strongest city, Chicago, and scatterings across the country. In any case, if you're not white, Catholic, or had some connections or money prior to attending Notre Dame, the vast majority of that alumni network *will not be accessible by you,* and frankly, that will also go for your ability to make connections among the majority of your classmates, the ""Notre Dame"" family.

For people of color, student organizations are the best bet for any sort of network, and sometimes they're good - BLSA (Black Law Students Association) does have an actual alumni network that's fairly strong, while other groups won't have them or have them ""in name only"", with nothing special to differentiate them. First-Gens can sometimes break this mold, but they have to hustle starting from the moment they walk through the door. Since the school's policy is that first-year law students can't meet with career advisors until well into first-semester, this becomes a massive issue. First-generation law students aren't walking in with access to legal career wisdom in the form of connections to family and other legal professionals. Some will. Most won't. Thanks to this school, many will never truly get the opportunity to.

That isn't to say that there aren't people of color or first-generation students that have thrived here, or gone on to lead successful careers. But this school won't help facilitate that, and for the price tag, all of you deserve better than this. "

Before joining the program, I had to idea what notre dame was and the lifestyle they had implemented within the university, but every day I spent at the program, was a day I spent understanding and appreciating the beauty of the campus and the greatness of the students. 

Luckily I was given a scholarship from a program outside of notre dame to attend, and I will forever thank the people who gave me that opportunity. If you or your child or cousin or whatever gets accepted to the Notre Dame Summer Scholars program, I highly recommend they attend, especially if they are lost on what universities or colleges they want to attend.

This school has become my number 1 choice now, and has made me want to try the hardest I possibly can to get into this school. There was not a single bad day on campus, move-in day was even enjoyable. The roommate selection that the school provides too was so perfectly made, I became best friends since day one. The people I met and the current students I bonded with there, god everything was just so nice and felt so safe and accepting. 

  
*To all the males* applying, I can speak for you, the dorm-life is something you should never worry about in this program, and instead be excited, everybody is so welcoming and will love you for you. Two weeks may sound short but the connections you can make are incredible. 

The way they implemented teams into their schedule with THE NOTRE GAMES, and the competitions they held, made the school spirit so much better, and even brought you close to people you'll never think to meet, from international students from all over the world, to people across america, that shit was beautiful.

Take the opportunity, take the chance, and to everybody reading this, you know damn well I am trying to get back in next year.

I am an incoming freshman studying pre professional studies in the college of science. I had met with my advisor today and they recommended I take 5 classes plus the Moreau  First experience. When I was trying to arrange all of the classes the potential schedule looked very packed and I would end up potentially taking 18 credits.

Thats too much right? How many classes should I be taking each semester?

First week is like summer camp, don’t worry it doesn’t last but it’s pretty fun and memorable. 

Be selective with your friends but try and meet everyone. 

Don’t worry too much about dorms they are all good and the culture in every dorm seems nice as far as I can tell.  

Use any information you can find on what classes to pick and be as fast as you can when you register (each wave is every 10 minutes.) 

Don’t be afraid to drop a class if the professor seems sucky or you are not into it (I made this this mistake)

RA’s are really not out to get you, don’t blatantly break rules in front of them and you should be ok 

Not everyone will feel it but imposter syndrome is normal and it went away for me. 

You get better at school as you go. My friends and I all agree that despite having harder classes our study habits allow us to study for less time and do better. 

Ok hope this helps, I like it here a lot and I’m sure y’all will too.

I am an incoming freshman who is planning on being PreMed. I am looking to have an education that is more well rounded and less science heavy than a traditional PreMed major such as Bio. I loved my social science classes in high school and feel that I would greatly enjoy adding them to my education in college. I am deciding between pursuing an Arts and Letters Pre-Heath Degree and a Science Pre-Professional Studies Major. Does anyone have any insights or advice on this?

I was especially wondering if anyone could share their experiences with the Arts and Letters Pre-Heath program? What was a typical semester schedule like when you were completing your prereqs? Do you think it was a heathy balance of science and other subjects? Did you feel just as prepared in med school as your B.S counterparts? Did you feel you had equal opportunities to pursue research and internships as your College of Science counterparts?

On the other hand, if you chose Science Pre-Professional Studies, did you feel it provided an adequate balance of stem and social sciences? Do you feel that you have career paths open to you if you chose not to attend med school?

Thank you in advance for your help! I appreciate any information you're willing to share. "
Please Help me Decide - Notre Dame or UPenn for Pre-med,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/1co41y8/please_help_me_decide_notre_dame_or_upenn_for/,8,18,2024-05-09 18:21:15,"Hi guys, thanks for taking your time to read this! I’m a recently admitted student to both UPenn and Notre Dame trying to figure out where to go. For reference I’m interested in going pre-med and majoring in Biology. I’m really trying to figure out which school is going to give me better opportunities and an overall better chance of making the strongest med school application from the experiences I’ll get over my four years. 

There’s some other things I’m considering;

* I’ve heard UPenn tends to be slightly more competitive and “toxic”, whereas Notre Dame seems to have a much better community and environment. Any thoughts/insights on the environment?

* I know Notre Dame is very undergrad focused, so in terms of lab environments, while it varies based on PI, are undergrads at UPenn able to contribute as meaningfully to the lab work and get something out of it in terms of experiences, paper publications, and rec letters?

* How do both schools stack up in terms of foreign/study abroad pre med experiences? 

My current impression is that Notre Dame is going to do a better job facilitating more/more meaningful undergraduate experiences and has a better overall environment, but UPenn has arguably better location/prestige/connections, but I might be wrong on either of these. Are there any reasons I would choose UPenn over Notre Dame for pre-med or vice versa? What school do you guys think I should choose and why?  Any advice would be really appreciated and thanks so much again!

Notre Dame is offering me a $50000 tuition waiver and even then, I will require a student loan of around $25k to attend the 11 months program. (ESTEEM Graduate Program)

University of Rochester is providing me a full fund including tuition, health insurance and a generous stipend to cover all living expenses and more. 

However, I don't want to do a PhD and end up studying for 6-7 more years :( 

I come from a lower middle income family and finances are an important aspect before making my decision. I am at loss and cant make a decision anymore.

A few folks on here asked when this would be offered again, so here it is: the new-and-improved version of Data Analytics and Economic Evaluation for Social Impact (ECON 33450) will be offered this fall. One section is full, but we still have a couple of seats left on T/TR 9:30-10:45am to bring some fun to your mornings!

Counts for econ intensive writing and relevant for data science [+]() policy-minded folks as well. If you are still finalizing your schedule, would love to see you in the fall.

- Prof. Chris Mills 



>""Economics and data science are powerful tools that can improve people’s lives. This course will equip you to: (1) describe data, (2) use machine learning to predict the future, (3) establish cause and effect, and (4) address pressing social challenges using economic frameworks. There will be an emphasis on critical thinking – including the strengths and limitations of impact evaluation – and communicating research findings effectively with stakeholders. The course will feature guest speakers from public policy, tech, and economics. Focus areas will include: poverty alleviation, child protection, upward mobility, human-algorithm interaction, sports and culture, and other topics of student interest. Students will develop and present their own research project during the semester. Basic applied statistics background is recommended but can be waived with permission. This course is ideal for students hoping to see the big picture of an economics major, those in other disciplines passionate about the intersection of data analysis and social challenges, and those hoping to gain perspective on high-impact career opportunities.""

I would have taken 13-14 AP classes with over 32 credits by the end of senior year high school.

* How will it show up on college transcript if a student has used AP credits? Do colleges look down if someone has transferred AP credits from high school?
* ND accepts AP credits. Do you get to skip that class altogether and free up time for other things like ECs? or are you pushed automatically into higher level classes? I'm worried about using credits and end up with difficult classes that could potentially make getting higher GPA difficult.
* Lastly, does it give you any advantage or priority having AP credits in choosing classes/teachers at ND? Hoping to choose best profs with easier grades lol.
* Any other advise how current students in premed use (or not) AP credits.

On the other hand, going to school in-state would allow me to graduate nearly debt free before attending medical school.

I truly loved Notre Dame when I visited for the people and the campus itself, but I don’t think it’s realistic for me to spend that much on loans.

First, are there any gpa requirements to stay in Glynn? I'm not planning to slack off, but I also don't want to constantly fixated on my gpa.

Second, do they distinguish between liberal arts and stem students at all? For example, will I be in the same philosophy and seminar classes as say, English majors? Also, will they be in the same science classes as me?

And last thing, is there any data on med school acceptances for students in Glynn compared to the university as a whole?

Hey guys,

I’m between ND and Pomona. I’m honestly torn. I recently visited both and loved both. I want to live in California but mom wouldn’t let me…She visited ND with me and also liked it. She said she would be okay for me to go to ND. I think that with the smaller class size for Pomona, I would thrive because I think that I’m better suited (especially I’ll be taking the hard classes like Ochem). I can’t say the same for ND, from what I heard, the avg class size for Ochem is like 90 ppl…



Some important factors I consider is party scene,  location, food, religion (I’m Catholic). I am also planning to do Premed and from my research, both are excellent for Premed.

For some context: ND offered me almost a full ride and I would have to pay around 10k/year for Pomona.

IU vs ND,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/1c9484c/iu_vs_nd/,10,9,2024-04-20 23:55:01,"Finances 

IU
My dad works there so half tuition
$8000 per year luddy scholars scholarship
$3000 per year luddy direct admit scholarship 
$1500 provost scholarship
So it rounds out to around $10000 per year 

ND
$346000 total cost of attendance 
After scholarships (nd financial aid and local alumni club)
$214,000
My parents and grandparents are in a great position to provide a lot for me
At worst I would personally pay $46,000 and at best $33,500

I would have to take out some loans but I have worked all of high school and have around $15,000 saved up but I wouldn’t necessarily put it all to college

Academics/major

IU 
I applied to luddy school for data science but I would most likely get a dual degree with the IU Kelley school for finance
Also I already got the Indiana college core which IU accepts 30 credits and sophomore standing

ND
Applied to Mendoza for finance and got in
I will likely double major in applied and computational mathematics and statistics maybe with a minor in data science

With my career I want to go into investment banking or business/financial consulting right after undergrad (possibly a burnout career I don’t know if I want to do that forever)

Then I might go back to school for phd in data science and do research or teach or I may branch out in business or data analytics in business not sure yet

Other considerations
- I’m from bloomington Indiana and have lived here my whole life. I want to start fresh in college and be away from my family.

- I am not religious and have grown up in a family of atheists. I am not concerned about the catholic “stuff” but it is a consideration.

I am heavily leaning towards ND but I want to feel confident that the ROI is worth it and that student loans aren’t the end of the world. 

Any thoughts??"

I'm asking a question on behalf of my younger sister who just got accepted to Notre Dame. While we're absolutely thrilled that she got in, and it's been a longtime dream of hers, we realized we will likely not be able to afford it. The problem is that our household income has been increased for the past two years due to the pandemic (our dad works in healthcare and was working 70-80 hours weekly) and his hours are returning to normal so he will make much less this year and onwards. COA at ND would be about \~$65k, and it's really out of our means. Meanwhile, she is getting close to a full ride at OU. She applied as a biology major (pre-med) but would likely explore different career paths if she went to ND.

She has already sent an email to the financial aid office to try and see if they can help at least a little. My question is, is it a possibility to attend a less costly university for one year and to try to transfer into ND a year or two later? My apologies if this is a disrespectful or stupid question--I'm just trying to see if we can make Notre Dame financially feasible. Additionally, was Notre Dame truly worth it to you even if it made things financially strained? Thanks."

I'm an international student and I don't know which university to choose. Should I go to B.Arch at Notre Dame or Virginia Tech? I guess a lot of people wouldn't think about this and would immediately say Notre Dame, but I'm not totally convinced. From what I've heard, they focus primarily on architectural history, and I've also seen somewhere that they don't focus on design in architecture until the 4th year. Virginia Tech focuses on working with new materials, practice, etc... I know both universities require students to go through basically the same thing in architecture, but fundamentally I think it's clear that Notre Dame focuses more on history and religion and Virginia Tech focuses more on sustainability and Innovation. Anyway, Notre Dame has a bigger name, but as far as architecture goes, that's not exactly the direction I want to go. So should I really decide to go to Virginia Tech or is my assumption about Notre Dame false?

After coming home from work travel, I woke up from a mid-day nap friday to a phone call from the Mendoza Business School admissions team to congratulate me on my acceptance into the program and some preliminary next steps to secure my spot. It felt like a fever dream. I still don't think I've fully processed my acceptance or the fact that I'm finally beginning my life's goals of obtaining my graduate degree. 

For now, I'm taking it day by day and looking forward to the welcome events to around the corner. I'm super proud of myself and nervous for the workload coming at me this fall while still working full-time. 

I think this channel mostly discusses undergrad news but I thought I'd chime in on some graduate acceptance. It's been a long time coming for me and I'm so excited to be apart of the ND legacy. 

If you're apart of the Mendoza Business School as a current student or alum, let me know! I live in Chicago but will be coming to campus alot!

The problem is that Notre Dame will likely be considerably more expensive than my current institution to the point where federal loans will not cover the expenses of college. I was able to earn a half-scholarship, which reduces the cost of college considerably. Because of my background, I believe that I am in situation where my EFC will not reflect what my family is capable of paying.

As an outsider looking in, there are many things that draw me to Notre Dame. These include the community, the campus, the football the alumni network, and the academics, but it is hard for to justify going into 40-60k debt, and possibly even 100k or more debt simply to be a student here.

My kid was deferred by ND,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/18mkgs4/my_kid_was_deferred_by_nd/,0,43,2023-12-20 03:15:20,"Can't figure out the reason. Read some other posts for what type of students ND wants. My kid fits all. Class rank top 3% in public school, 14 APs all 5 covering most rigorous APs that school offers, 1550+ SAT, AAA ice hockey player, lots of community services, summer reasearch, very good LORs, etc. 
Does religion play an important role here? The only kid I know from my kid's HS who got in ND two years ago was Christian.

Update: 
I thought it would be good to wrap up this conversation at the end of the application cycle.
Norte Dame rejected my kid at RD. It is what it is. Still a good experience and Norte Dame is still a good school in my mind.
My kid has a few options now - UNC, GIT, Georgetown, Vanderbilt, Case Western, Duke, Williams, Bowdoin. 
Appreciate all your comments. Wish all the kids good luck in colleges.

Does UND drug test potential employees for marijuana?,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/17i0ojb/does_und_drug_test_potential_employees_for/,11,14,2023-10-27 23:33:43,I am currently interviewing for a non-faculty position at UND and heard that all offers of employment are dependent on candidates passing a drug test.

Admissions w/ bad gpa because of mental health?,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/17ah23t/admissions_w_bad_gpa_because_of_mental_health/,0,13,2023-10-18 03:29:40,"I visited Notre Dame a couple weeks ago and fell in love. Only problem is I'm really concerned about my application.

I have a *low* GPA, around a 3.77. However, I struggled a lot with anxiety in high school. I had great grades freshman year while online but when I got back to in-person school some pretty crippling anxiety surfaced. I fell really behind because of sporadic panic attacks where I'd feel like I was going to throw up and had to leave class frequently. I also lost my appetite and because I wasn't eating my overall health was pretty bad. My attendance was horrible because I was leaving school early almost every day. As you'd imagine, this really impacted my grades and although I tried I just couldn't keep up. On the bright side, I was taking the most advanced classes possible. I'm a senior now and go to therapy frequently. I still have bad anxiety but I've figured out how to manage it and I've gotten help at my school. I'm also diagnosed with 2 anxiety disorders but not on any meds because I reacted badly to them. I should be submitting almost straight A's (my 3.77 accounts for this), which I am super proud of because my senior courseload has been super hard, but I feel like all my work in managing my anxiety has really paid off.

The rest of my application is decently competitive? My SAT is okay (770 verbal but only 680 math) and I have two 5's. My school doesn't offer APs but I took a couple tests anyway. My recs should be really good though. My common app is about my core values and how it's impossible for me to not say something when I see something that violates them. ND supplements I think are really good, I put a ton of heart into them and I've gotten a lot of positive feedback. I think my ECs are what stands out though. Not going to list everything, but highlights are a internship at a law firm where I authored self-help flyers for over 2000 underserved community members and did a ton of demographic research for grant proposals. I've also spent 4 years on varsity and am a 2x state qualifier in track and field. I got 2nd with my team at my states Debate competition (also co-captain of the club) and have over 500 hours of community service from organizations like the YMCA. I also volunteer with dogs at a animal shelter and am the captain of their teen club. Before someone asks, yes this is a lot of stressful situations for someone with anxiety to be dealing with. My anxiety is pretty subconscious, some situations trigger me and some don't. I can't control it, just have to manage it. Demographically, I'm mixed race and from a high income household. My whole family are Roman Catholics. Small advanced private school in Chicago. 

I really want to go to ND but I'm worried that my GPA is pretty much going to disqualify me. Although my mental health challenges were very real and challenging, I just don't know if ND is going to take it as a valid reason for my bad GPA. I have a other information paragraph pretty much saying what I wrote above and how my anxiety is a lot better now. Does anyone have any thoughts? Am I competitive at all? Although I'm very committed to ND and will be applying REA, I don't want to submit a application that is immediately going to be dumped. Thanks for any feedback :)"

This venerable institution has long been the focal point of my educational aspirations, encapsulating social, athletic, and religious elements that I deem essential in a university. I regard Notre Dame as an exemplar in these facets, unmatched elsewhere in the nation.

Admittedly, my academic record does not shine brilliantly, with a GPA of 3.5, predominantly in standard courses. However, my forte lies in extracurricular engagement. I presently serve as an intern in a land development firm, focusing on land acquisition under the tutelage of the CEO and Director of Land Acquisition. I have overseen land valuations amounting to nearly $12,000,000 within a year.

Furthermore, my twin brother and I have initiated and nurtured two non-profit organizations collaborating with local Catholic entities. Over the past four years, we have raised almost $35,000 and gathered over 60,000 articles of clothing. Additionally, I presently manage assets valued at approximately $15,000, consistently yielding annual returns of 6-8%, notably achieving a single-year return of 16%, outperforming the S&P 500.

In my personal development, I am committed to exceeding 200 hours of community service over four years, surpassing my high school's requirement of 80 hours. I am open to the prospect of attending a junior or community college for a year or two if necessary.

Furthermore, I have engaged with numerous Notre Dame alumni who are willing to provide letters of recommendation and support. As a devout Catholic, several local priests have also expressed their willingness to endorse my application. Attending the University of Notre Dame is a dream shared by my family, and I earnestly seek your guidance in realizing this aspiration. Your counsel would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, and Go Irish!"

I feel like my educational and learning aspects have not grown that much and I’m chasing the diploma. Praying that the diploma holds enough weight to cancel out a bad gpa (and I hate when someone with a 3.3 say they have a bad gpa). Can anyone else relate to struggling to this extent? I understand everyone’s stressed, but just wanting to pass most classes is a stress I don’t see in others around me.

Wondering if it's possible to sell football tickets back to University (or any other method),https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/16lhmdw/wondering_if_its_possible_to_sell_football/,10,23,2023-09-18 01:04:02,"Hey y'all, 

So, my partner and I (both Notre Dame grads) have been planning on going to the Ohio State game this weekend. But through a series of unfortunate events, the friends we were going to stay with/get us from Chicago to the game and back have canceled on us, and the friends we were supposed to see have also decided not to go as well. Between the extra cost of a last-minute hotel and transit to and from Chicago to campus, we're looking at sinking a legit $2000 into the weekend (up from only around $1000 before) and not seeing anyone we graduated with. Just a sad, lonely tailgate by ourselves. 

I'm at the point where I'd like to consider selling our tickets and just cutting our losses, but I don't even know if it's possible to do so.  We got them through our local club, and we'd be happy to sell them back to the University. Is there a process to do that? If not, is there a backdoor way to sell them? 

To be 100% transparent, we aren't 100% sold on the idea of selling our tickets, so please don't offer to buy them or try to convince us to. We know they're in high demand, we just want to know if it's even possible before we reserve a hotel/transportation. Yes, yes, sunk cost fallacy and all that, but since it's so much extra money we want to make an as informed decision as possible. 

Also, if anyone is willing to help us out with the Chicago transit question (we know about the South Shore Line - just concerned about getting back from the stadium to the station), we'd love to hear it. I really want to go, I just wasn't expecting to have to drop an additional grand last minute. "

How important is being a Catholic or having a religious background in getting to University of Notre Dame?,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/16ewn17/how_important_is_being_a_catholic_or_having_a/,5,9,2023-09-10 10:13:26,"Hi Guys,

This is a senior from Asia who really likes the tight and supportive community, friendly professors, and the general quality of teaching at Notre Dame. While I was really considering to apply it at REA round, one thing that worries me is lacking of a religious background( I have a strong community contribution and devotion to revive the forgotten culture in my community) It is weird to say so but the admission session I attended says they would not view it as a determining factor but the most recent record in our school which students get accepted had a very strong religious background. But it could involve a sense of inaccuracy since some students might be discouraged from applying, assuming that Notre Dame prefer students have link with religion.

I really want to have some ideas/advices from people who know if Notre Dame would have tis kinds of preference.

I would be so grateful towards any responses.

Thanks!!!"

• When do students start to look for employment? For example before the first week of classes start, or around the time they start?

• Is employment as easy as filling out the requirements (resume, cover letter, etc.) and sending it to the person overlooking it? I’ve heard of things before like people undergoing backup checks and things and I was wondering if I was missing anything like that

• Is JOBboard the only place I can look for employment? I know it might not seem realistic with the competitiveness of getting a job but I’m actively seeking somewhere near an “office” job like position, where I can study lots (hearing from other current students) and balance working.

• Will more jobs post as time goes on or is it usually whatever is there is what’s going to stay there for the rest of the semester/year?

I was just wondering if anyone who currently has been or is in the school could tell me about their experience. Is it hard to get a job after college? How difficult is the workload in relation to social life? Would it be very difficult if I was pre-med and an architecture major? Anybody who is an NSBH major, please let me know what your experience is as well. Thank you!!"

Annual engineering laptop question,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/15b6w9u/annual_engineering_laptop_question/,6,6,2023-07-27 16:48:49,"Entering ND engineering this fall, probably mechanical. Have looked at the recommended specs, but any specific thoughts regarding:
Any particular machine that seems most common among engineering students?
Mac vs windows machine, knowing the new M2s no longer allow running windows except through emulation?
Is touchscreen common/useful/recommended by students?
Recommended graphics card?
Recommended screen size?

For those who end up working on more heavy duty projects on the schools computers, do you find this is perhaps an advantage because it allows for more collaboration?
Thanks to all who share thoughts."
