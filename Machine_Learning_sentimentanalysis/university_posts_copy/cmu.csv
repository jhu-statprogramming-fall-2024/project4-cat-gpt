## Hey, my major isn't an available option!

If you want a flair that doesn't fit this format, like multiple majors or both undergrad and grad degrees, send modmail and I'll customize it for you."
[MEGATHREAD 10] Ask generic questions about CMU here.,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1f9uirt/megathread_10_ask_generic_questions_about_cmu_here/,14,21,2024-09-05 19:04:37,"Do you have a generic question about CMU, like:

* Which dorm is the best?

* Does CMU prepare you for grad school?

* Is <major> difficult?

* Where should I eat on campus?

Then this is the right place to ask.

## Why a megathread?

This megathread is to help prevent top-level posts from being downvoted and then left unanswered. It also provides one thread as a reference for folks with future questions to prevent multiple posts with the same generic questions.

This thread is automatically sorted by ""new"", so post away, even if there are a lot of comments.

For best results, remember to search this page or [the most recent previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/nenrn2/megathread_9_post_your_questions_about_admissions/) for keywords (like ""15-251"", ""dorm"", etc.) before posting a question that is identical or very similar to one that's already been asked.

---

## Is this the right place to ask?

We don't allow ""chance me"" posts, which are posts asking about the likelihood of admissions to CMU. Use dedicated subs like /r/chanceme and /r/ApplyingToCollege.

/r/pittsburgh is generally better resource for questions that aren't specific to CMU, like where to live and where to go grocery shopping.

As a reminder, **you can report posts that should be comments in the megathread instead** if seeing them posted at top-level bothers you. Please choose ""It breaks r/cmu's rules"" and then ""Use the megathread"" as the reason. Similarly, you can report ""chance me"" posts and comments."
should i take 15112 without much coding experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1gwmpss/should_i_take_15112_without_much_coding_experience/,7,5,2024-11-21 18:40:11,"freshan in cit looking at chemE here, I saw on the course sample we can pick between physics 2 or 15112 if I m not interpreting this wrong, but I def need advice on which one to pick:

  
I have credit for 15110 from apcsp...from 10th grade in HS :|, last year I tried to pick coding up so I completed the basic concepts modulus at w3schools website for python and java, still I wont say that I can write a long program or anything. I have heard how advanced the course content at 15112 is and how hard it is to even get a B there, so should I even consider taking 15112? 

Or, how much coding experience is actually needed to get at least a B in 15112?

  
thx in advanced :P"

Tales from the Soarch Tattler No 105 Sick Words for the Unhealthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1gwlkqp/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_105_sick_words/,0,0,2024-11-21 17:55:27,"Grab a chair and lend me  your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount  some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After  all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this  alumnus is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will  not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

Occasionally something happens that makes people wonder what is truly wrong with those undergrad archies on campus. Sometimes it forces others to commit forgeries of great length to cover up the archies’ misdeeds and present a better image of the university as a whole. This true tale is one such case brought to light over a decade after it happened.

During my fourth year, the art students above us in CFA attempted a gesture of goodwill for the local Children’s Hospital. They covered the one working elevator cabin with sheets of blank paper and left crayons or pencils for people to write well-wishes to the kids. Everything went according to plan with plenty of good, kind words until the upperclassmen archies came to CFA for their afternoon classes.

I can’t repeat what the bad apples wrote. I know they made it a point to ride the elevators between classes and meals as often as possible to write horridly twisted messages on those sheets of paper. They would giggle as they walked into studio, telling other delinquents, who would then burst out laughing, trying to think of even worse things to say or draw.

Eventually, the art students tore down the sheets of obscenities and placed fresh sheets for kind people to try again. The unkind souls saw it as another opportunity to up their ante in the profane. By the end of the day, word came into studio that the downtrodden art students tore down the second set of sheets and would spend the rest of the week making their own sheets of kind words to deliver to the Children’s Hospital. There was no need to tell the kids what truly happened in CFA courtesy of the architecture students.

Thus, the one at the Children’s Hospital, if it still exists, is sadly a forgery; but for understandable reasons. Of course, those who lived through this true tale still ask “what is wrong with those archies,” indeed.

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

Undergrad Application Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1gw50mz/undergrad_application_question/,0,4,2024-11-21 02:01:25,"Hi all,

I'm applying RD, and am really interested in a combination of Robotics, MechE, and CS.

My educational background is much more rooted in CS than it is MechE, just cause there isn't such thing as High School engineering courses; meanwhile, I've been able to take sophomore/junior year level summer CS classes at SUNY Stonybrook and did AP CSA in 8th grade and post-AP courses at my high school.

On the other hand, a lot of my out of class work has been on the design side/particularly for my school's robotics team, which I started and have had to solo CAD everything, which has pushed me more to the mechanical side for the first time in my life, given the lack of resources I had before robotics to actually make physical stuff.

Right now, I'm planning on applying MechE and just having an additional major in robotics, do you think I should do it the other way around, and knowing that CS (robotics probably included) has a smaller acceptance rate, do you think that this is smarter I guess -> I am going to mention that I plan on double majoring in the ""what are you interested essay"" cause I wouldn't feel good ""gaming"" the system btw.

Thanks for all of the advice :)"

I was banned from Hunan,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1gupagg/i_was_banned_from_hunan/,173,34,2024-11-19 04:46:11,"I am deleting this post in less than two hours because it is too emotional and I can get all the advice I need in this time.

What happened was really traumatic and I am still processing it. For the past year and a half I have felt out of place and depressed at CMU. The only place I can go to unwind and feel welcomed is Hunan Express. 

The short lady always smiles at me and greets me in her special way: “fried rice” (that’s her nickname for me). Never once have they turned me away and it always puts a smile on my face. 

 One day about a year ago I developed a raging crush on the man working behind the counter. We had a casual greeting that only we understood: “block or flex” he would ask and I would say the secret code only he understand “card”. I thought this was fairly obvious that this means I wanted to give him my V card but apparently he never picked up.

Eventually I decided it was time to do something about it as my feelings reached an apex. After greeting the Hunan Staff as usual I professed my love for the man working the register. I told him I wanted to be his general tso but he was clearly uncomfortable with my proposition.

For the past year I have tried to keep my space and be respectful, but still continued to show up to Hunan. I always made sure to only stare at the man at the register for 3 hours uninterrupted each day instead of the normal 6.

For some reason though, the mean man seems to have reported me and now I am BANNED from Hunan. I am irreconcilable and don’t know what to do. Those were my only friends in all of CMU and now they have been stolen from me.

Any advice?"

1. How well established is the program in general? Considering how interdisciplinary it is, does it gives students any leeway to explore other topics and research or are you supposed to try and find an advisor asap?
2. What's the expected profile for admitted students? Does admission rely a lot on the prestige of the school you went to for your bachelor's, and are there any specific degree requirements? I tried searching the site but I didn't end up finding any specific information besides the usual ""equivalent to US bachelor's"". I ask mainly because in Europe, bachelor's degrees are typically only 3-years in duration and some schools in the US end up not accepting them for grad admissions.
3. How do you feel about the program and climate for graduate students in general? Are you happy with how the program is structured or do you have anything you'd like to share about it?

CMU CS PhD Application Form Issue on Waiving Letters of Recommendation,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1gui8ie/cmu_cs_phd_application_form_issue_on_waiving/,1,5,2024-11-18 22:58:33,"I recently learned that not waiving letters of recommendation hurts your application, so I need to change my letters of recommendation from not-waived to waived. Normally, I would do that by excluding the not-waived letters and sending out requests to the same people as before, this time with the waived option selected. However, the CMU CS PhD application does letters of recommendation in a different way. There's a single waived/not-waived toggle that applies to all letters. Letters also can't be excluded or deleted. You also can't delete or make a new application unless you use a different email (which I don't have and don't want to do). I have five recommenders. I set the toggle to not-waived, sent out all five requests, three of them submitted, I flipped the toggle from not-waived to waived, a fourth one submitted, and now I'm not sure what is going on behind the scenes or how to fix this. Does flipping the toggle back and forth actually do anything? Are all five going to have a not-waived status, or just the first three? Is there any way to exclude letters, some way I don't know about? The FAQ page says that you can only have a max of five letters, but I was able to add a sixth; if I send five new requests, now with the toggle set to waived, will I be able to exclude the five old not-waived letters to meet the max-of-five requirement? I desperately need someone to help me figure this out so I can fix it. Any help would be great."

I'm posting for my son here. He's a Y10 (grade 9) student, studying in UK and plans to apply to CMU in four years time. CMU always holds a special place for us since both my husband and I, did Master and Ph.D. program there but only as graduate students, so we have no idea how difficult the course registration process may be.

1. Can a student in SCS register for courses in music department as well, if he isn't in the BCSA program? Will the music school gives priority to students in their program first?

2. He is still deciding between SCS vs BCSA, but he has strong background in STEM, AMC-10 (since in grade7), UKMT SMC, BMO, USACO, Lockheed-martin coding challenge, etc. 

Besides coding and math, his passion is in music. He schedules to take Trinity grade 8 exam in March, and plans to do RockSchool Level 4 Associate Award, before he's done with Y11, which is comparable to the first year of a university degree. His music teacher also commented that his strength is in composition.

There are only limited number of universities that offer program focusing on both CS and Music, i.e., BSCA at CMU and UIUC. However, if the student is incline towards CS-heavy, but still would like to do something in music, is it doable at SCS at CMU? Or will BSCA be a better match?

Any advice is really appreciated.

Tales from the Soarch Tattler No 104 The Studio Happy Hour,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1gqlb72/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_104_the_studio/,4,0,2024-11-13 19:31:16,"Grab a chair and lend  me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount  some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of  Architecture. After  all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumnus is glad to write as many of them down that  can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

Some years ago, there was an architecture professor who was notoriously hard on his studio. He never let up and exhausted them every semester, to the point [some would drop out of the yearlong commitment to his program](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/1bpjg16/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_91_lady_umsalot/). Those that held on found a covert way to cope with the madness every day in studio.

Once the professor made his rounds and left CFA, the students would get a little grin growing on their face as they watched the other professors likewise but less punctually clock out for the day. It was only when the last teacher left that one of them would bend over and open up the secret refrigerator they kept under the desk.

A pull of a bottle cap and a soft whoosh would announce their own unofficial happy hour after class. I couldn’t say there was anything magical about the fridge but it did seem to hold a supernatural amount of ice cold brews. Some days, they clearly needed a little extra and the fridge never let them down.

Now, I would not assume the professor in question was entirely oblivious to that refrigerator half-buried under cardboard. [Like the famous semester of strippers on full display in studio models](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/qd4m1o/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_25_the_studio/), it was more like turning a blind eye to such things for the sake of decorum. After all, at the end of semester, [he always gave a toast of his personal hard spirits to his students](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/t986ay/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_37_a_toast_with/).

As to who was actually oblivious of the fridge, that fell on naive students hired by the department to clean up studio between semesters.  They didn’t discover the abandoned and unplugged fridge until during a heatwave in July. Some say the stench of spoiled beer still haunts them to this day.

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

I’m interested in applying for a scholarship at Carnegie Mellon University Africa (CMU Rwanda) to study Machine Learning, but I’m a bit lost on where to start and what steps to take.

For context, I’ve recently been accepted into a course at the University of Rwanda, supported by AFRETEC, that could potentially help me secure a scholarship for CMU Rwanda. However, I want to ensure I fully understand the application process and meet all the necessary requirements for a successful application.

If anyone here has experience with the CMU Africa scholarship process, I’d be really grateful for your advice on:

1.Application Steps: What are the main steps for applying for a scholarship in ML at CMU Rwanda? Are there specific documents or prerequisites I should focus on?

2.Requirements: Are there particular academic or professional achievements that would increase my chances? Any recommendations for showcasing my ML background?

3.Tips for Success: What advice would you give someone trying to stand out in the application process?

4.Financial Aid Details: If anyone has insight into what the scholarship typically covers and if there’s other financial support available (e.g., for living expenses), that would be super helpful.

Thank you so much in advance! I’d appreciate any and all insights or resources you could share."

Depression at CMU/Message to future applicants ,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1gm7hu9/depression_at_cmumessage_to_future_applicants/,101,47,2024-11-08 01:58:02,"I would heavily recommend to any current high school students that are looking at CMU as a possible college option that they make sure they understand the school, the culture, and know what they want out of college. 

In my opinion, the school does not provide nearly enough for what it costs mentally, physically, and financially. It is very much a place where people put their heads down and do work all the time, and that may resonate with how you like to operate, but to be under that pressure all the time damages you a lot. For that reason, I've noticed that this school also kills a lot of passions and dreams. People come in wanting to study something but because of the pressures and the reputation to do CS or pursue a harder degree, they end up forcing themselves into fields they don't enjoy because they think it'll land them a high-paying job. Despite its reputation as a strong school, very few employers hire any more than a handful of CMU students a year, and the school's career departments do very little to help students, often they send out applications to jobs that have already expired, or reject offers from Alumni to bring their companies to campus career fairs.

Mental health here is horrible, especially in the winter months. Depression and suicidal tendencies are extraordinarily common here, but no one ever talks about it because of the academic nature of the school. The school psychology and mental health services (CaPs) are not adequately staffed to handle it, often times if you call to try and schedule an appointment to speak with somebody you'll have to join a waiting list a week or two in advance because they are constantly full of struggling students. A lot of other students I've met share the same sentiment, that the school expects from you much more than you can handle. CMU did a study in 2019 that showed that over 60% of students exhibit signs of clinical depression, and honestly I wouldn't be surprised if that number was higher, since they haven't repeated the study since. There is not a lot of free time here depending on your major, but most weekends are spent doing work. In general, the social scene is also very stagnant, you'll have to to Pitt for any parties and the only place you'll find full of people on a Friday night is the library. 

  
If you are someone that needs a forgiving place to explore what you want to do as a major or in life, or someone who thinks going to a top school will land you a high-paying job, I would reconsider your decisions for this school. For most people, the majority of your weekend nights will be spent doing problem sets or studying. That's not to say the school is not the right place for everyone. There are certainly people who love their time at CMU, but it's definitely not the school for everyone."
Deeply Concerned about my Roommate ,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1gm320u/deeply_concerned_about_my_roommate/,148,37,2024-11-07 22:28:14,"I am a student at cmu and my roommate’s behavior recently has been very concerning. I went random and got someone that I’m not very similar to. Early in the semester he would spend a lot of time away doing work and never would really engage in conversation if I tried to speak to him. I kind of figured we would coexist for the rest of the year and had accepted that. Lately however his behavior has been super strange and erratic. He has picked up some very strange and unsettling behaviors. Sometimes he just stares at the wall completely silently and is unresponsive when I try to speak to him. He constantly speaks to himself and has full blown two-sided conversations. I’m not always able to make out what he says but one time he was arguing with himself about some research opportunity. He kept calling himself stupid and useless and then would also defend himself. He also sometimes will pace back and forth around the room late at night (like 3am) and when I ask him if he is okay he says “I am asleep.” He also does this in the middle of the day occasionally. His behavior keeps getting worse too. Now he just ignores me when I speak to him and doesn’t respond. There are also times when his skin looks sickly, his eyes are bloodshot, and he just stumbles around. It’s getting to the point where I feel unsafe when I am around him. Thankfully he disappears for long periods of time so I can at least have some moments in my room where I’m not on edge. I tried speaking to the housefellow but it didn’t seem like much would change. Does anyone have any advice? Thank you

EDIT: Thank you for all of the advice on this awful situation. I have filled out a Cares Referral and done a third party consultation with CAPS. I also got the chance to speak to another house fellow about the behavior. I don’t really think there are more steps to take as the university was already aware of some of the behaviors and I have no way to contact his family or advisors. I also haven’t seen him since 4:00 AM this morning. I’m being placed in emergency housing for the weekend and am being prioritized for a room change. I truly hope he gets the care he needs but I think I need to completely distance myself from him for my safety and wellbeing. Again thank you for all of the advice. "

Alas, I had forgotten a cable—a humble, two-foot-long cable, yet it lay across the chasm, all the way in the heart of Tepper. As I began my perilous trek, I did not fathom the grievous nature of the crime I was about to commit.

As I walked, behold: the lush extravagance of a private event. Surely the doors must be locked, I wondered. And yet, there it was—the quickest route to my cable. By some miracle, the door lay unlocked. A peasant stood amidst the wealthy splendor of the Tepperkind. The smells of opulent liquors and extraordinary foods filled the malnourished nostrils of a commoner. The cable beckoned as I moved among the nobility. Glances shot toward me—a mere rat in the presence of gods. I scurried along, gaze fixed downward, carving out the shortest path to the cable. I met my fellow peasants, told them the tale of my journey, collected my cable, and hurried back to the dungeon.

The short route through the grandiose crowd called to me again. I walked quickly, avoiding the eyes of the toplofty donors. I was almost there, halfway to the doors leading to the Forbes chasm, when I was stopped.

""This is a private event,"" a voice proclaimed. The presence of a peasant was unwelcome in this regal gathering; the path I had trodden mere seconds ago was now beyond my reach. Though so close to the door, I was banished from the midst of the rich. Relegated to the long path from Tepper’s front doors back to my dungeon, my crime: walking while poor.

As I walked out, I noticed the Knights of CMU Police, safeguarding the rich from us peasants, ensuring that no unsightly rats should dare walk through these blessed grounds. Clearly, the same money that had put me in debt did not grant me the right to walk through my own university. The celebration of past students must not be polluted by those currently within it.

With a heavy heart, I trudged on, back to my dungeon, toiling to bring glory to this very institution."

Voter Support Thread,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1gftnpz/voter_support_thread/,29,1,2024-10-30 18:31:25,"Reposting from the r/pittsburgh  sub for any voting students!

As we move into the home stretch, here's a list of the most common voting questions I'm seeing. Feel free to reach out with additional specifics if you need help. I do voter registration with the League of Women Voters and will get in touch with experts if I can't answer your question.

**Early Voting:** PA doesn't technically have early voting. The mechanisms that allowed it ended on 10/29

**Voting in Person**

* [Check your Voter Status](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/voterregistrationstatus.aspx)
* [Find your Polling Place](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx)
* [Info for First time voters](https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/new-voters.html) (If it's your first time vote in PA you're included here!!! You'll need ID at the polls)

**Mail-in Voting**

* [Track your ballot ](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/BallotTracking.aspx)(Getting to you, getting back to the gov, getting counted)
* [How to fill out your mail-in ballot](https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/mail-in-and-absentee-ballot.html#howto)
* **You MUST return your OWN ballot!** You CANNOT have a friend drop it off.
* **Your ballot by arrive by election day (Nov 5).** If you're worried that it's too close to mail it, you can drop it off or vote in person.[Here is the list of county dropoff locations. ](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Elections/Ballot-Return-Sites)You can also message me for help finding the nearest one. You CANNOT drop off your mail-in ballot at the polls.
* **If you don't receive your mail-in ballot** \- Go to your assigned polling place on election day. Request to vote provisionally. Your vote will count after they verify that they do not have your mail-in ballot.
* If you'd rather vote in person, bring the ENTIRE ballot including the envelopes to your polling place on election day. They will help you spoil the ballot and let you vote in person. If you don't have all the pieces, you'll vote provisionally. Your vote will count after they verify that they do not have your mail-in ballot.

**What else is on the ballot?**

In order to see a correct sample ballot, you need to know your district and ward.

[You can look up your district / ward and polling place using this tool](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx) You'll see two numbers after ""Polling Place Address for PITTSBURGH"" That's your Ward and your District (in that order).

[And then you can use this tool to find your sample ballot](https://apps.alleghenycounty.us/website/ElectPollPlace.aspx) (you’ll know if you got your ward and district switched if your polling place doesn’t match). If you live in the city, your Municipality is PITTSBURGH.

Generally, we're voting for President, US Senator, PA Attorney General (The state's top lawyer), PA Auditor General, PA State treasurer, US House Representative, and your State Senator and State Representative.

**Who will know that I voted?**  
The fact that you voted is public information. Anyone can look it up. But WHO you vote for is completely PRIVATE. No one will be able to look it up.

**Want to validate this info or talk with a person?** PA has a voter hotline. Call 1-877-868-3772. Interpretors are available.

*Disclaimer: This thread is non-partisan in that I will help anyone with their voter needs, regardless of who you vote for. That doesn't mean I don't have opinions. I obviously care deeply about democracy and have watched this year and past years as the Republicans have tried to disenfranchise all voters. If you want to vote on voter rights and democracy, the answer is Harris and the democrats.*"

Tales from the Soarch Tattler No 103. The Monster Parade,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1gf4orh/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_103_the_monster/,2,0,2024-10-29 20:31:47,"Grab a chair and lend me your fear as I recount some of the legends, gore, and deepest mysteries of the CMU School of Architorture. As a survivor, this alumnus is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected for the next generation to discover the horror and intrigue of their institution's haunted past. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly from your doom. So take them for what they are and beware!

While the frequent subject of these tales, architecture students are not the sole inhabitants of campus. Sometimes they must crawl out of studio and interact with others. Sometimes, the others have great fun in doing so.

One fateful autumn afternoon, the archies made their way down the CFA stairs for another lecture by the [infamously loquacious professor](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/1d43fhc/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_94_the_limits_of/). Group by group, they were soon to let out a great scream as unthinkable monstrosities approached them from the corners or behind columns. They were horrifyingly disfigured entities intent on grasping at and chasing the archies around the hall. The students’ only salvation was making the dash for the classroom door and shutting it with a loud thud. From the other side of the door, they could hear a few professors laughing in the hall, seemingly unbothered by these creatures. What was going on?

Around Halloween time, the drama kids have fun with a certain assignment of creating their own monsters. They draw them up, get materials, and create the costumes necessary to embody the beasts. Furthermore, they have to stay in character for the duration of the performance. The Drama Department made no effort to inform the architecture students, nor any guests in CFA for that matter. For the next hour or so, there were routine shrieks heard from the CFA hallway and the maniacal cackle of those observing the frights from a safe distance.

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

"Fellow Tartans - you can and should register to vote in PA, and the deadline is this Monday 10/21!",https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1g88t1g/fellow_tartans_you_can_and_should_register_to/,88,5,2024-10-20 20:53:59,"As a student in PA, you're allowed to to vote in **either** your home state or in PA.

Many choose to vote absentee in their home state, and I did this in the 2020 election when I went to CMU because I didn't understand the rules. But your vote will have a much bigger impact this election if you vote in PA instead of your home state.
PA is the most likely ""tipping point state."" This means in the presidential election, because of how the electoral math and polling is working out, **Pennsylvania is the most likely state to decide the winner of the Presidency.** [FiveThirtyEight's election forecast](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/) shows this visually very well.

Your vote will have more of an impact here in PA than ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE US. That is a huge privilege. Take this opportunity to have your voice heard and have youth vote change the direction of this election. You can literally decide the future of this country.

* **What if I'm already registered in another state?** You do not need to ""unregister"" from your former state. You need to [register as a new voter](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx) in PA. You'll still receive your absentee ballot from your former state. Do NOT send it in.

* **Is this legal?** Hell yes. [Here's the state website](https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/college-students.html) clearly telling you that you can register in PA. Anyone who tells you this is illegal is wrong or lying.

* **What if I come from another swing state?** If you're from Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, or Arizona, your vote is probably still more impactful in PA, but it's close. PA is still the most likely tipping point state, and it has more electoral votes than any other swing state. For any other state, PA is almost certainly the state where your vote has the most power. Of course, local elections matter too - if it's important to you to have a voice in your home state on other elections apart from the presidency, that is your choice to make. But you can help have a voice in local elections in Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and the state and make your current home a better place for you, too (and who knows, you might wind up back in this great city just like I did after graduating!)

* **How do I register?** You can [register online here](https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/college-students.html). It is clunky. You will need to sign a piece of paper and upload an image of it. Some people find it easier to do a paper ballot. There are likely organizations on campus that can help. Use your [dorm address](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/slice/civic-engagement/voter/polling-locations-by-housing-address-fall-2024-4.pdf) as your address if you live on-campus

* **Am I eligible?** Probably. If you'll turn 18 before Nov 11th, came to PA by October 10th this year, and are a US citizen, you can vote.

* **Do I need a PA License / Penn Dot ID?** No. You can use the last 4 digits of your SSN. That field is either/or despite the poor form design. (Not understanding this is why I failed to vote in PA last time - I have bad eyesight so it's a real hassle to change my license to a different state every time I move, but you don't have to do that to vote!)

* **Should I vote in person or by mail?** That's up to you! If you know you'll be out of town on 11/5, definitely choose vote by mail (but make sure you request your ballot very soon - see below!)

* **Where do I vote in-person?** If you live on-campus, [you can find your polling place here](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/slice/civic-engagement/voter/polling-locations-by-housing-address-fall-2024-4.pdf) based on which dorm you live in. If you live off-campus, [type in your address here](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/pollingplaceinfo.aspx) to find your polling place.

* **How do I request a mail-in ballot?** [Fill out this form](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/OnlineAbsenteeApplication/#/OnlineMailInBegin) ASAP - the deadline is next Tuesday 10/29, but you'll need your mail-in ballot to be **received** by 11/5, so request it now so it has time to get to you and time for you to get it back to the election office.

* **What if I already registered but haven't heard anything?** You can [check your status here](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/voterregistrationstatus.aspx). (You're in Allegheny County, probably 15213 if you're on campus, look up your zip code if you're off campus). The county has been really really slow this cycle at getting applications in. If you filled out your application in August and it's not up to date, register again. There is no penalty for it. You won't be registered twice.

Got more questions or overwhelmed? Send me a note! I'm super happy to help.

Youth turnout is always horribly low in elections, but it doesn't have to be! You can make a huge difference in this country's future by voting and getting your friends to vote!"

1.	⁠From what you’ve heard, what is the materials science and engineering program like at CMU?
2.	⁠⁠I’ve seen that the class size for MSE is quite small (but tight knit); is there a particular reason for that (ie. not many people apply in the first place/it’s competitive to get into)?
3.	⁠I have a very strong background in chemistry (at the high school level at least) and I’ve taken AP and 3 post AP Advanced chemistry courses at my school (ex. nanoscience or analytical chemistry). My GPA is a bit on the lower side but my SAT is 50th percentile for CMU and a few ppl at my school have been admitted to CMU with worse/similar GPAs as me (I had extenuating health conditions my sophomore & junior year tho). Since MSE is in the school of engineering, do you think it’s better for me to apply for chemistry in MCS and then try and transfer or should I just directly apply to MSE?
4.	⁠⁠I’ve heard some horror stories about CMU being a really hard transition for some students, making some people depressed and not getting the grades they wanted (for the most part I’ve seen this from CS or ECE people lol). Would you say this is true/is this applicable to non-CS/ECE majors like MSE?

The reason why I am asking is that I need it to decide what course I should register for in the spring (i.e. should I register for the Junior Cores in the spring or should I register for my minor courses since there are only 2 MechE sophomore cores)."

Tales from the Soarch Tattler No. 102 Hold the Onions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1fzwar8/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_102_hold_the/,0,0,2024-10-09 16:59:04,"Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount  some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to  discover the character  and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumnus is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected.  You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

There used to be a cantankerous professor with a small penchant for colorful comments. Perhaps the most benign instance recounted by shocked students was when he explained his dislike for hot glue in architecture models by comparing it to a bodily fluid that ruined models clearly built in haste. There were other rather candid instances, some of which were allegedly recorded by his students and posted online. Obviously, the university did not like the video tarnishing their reputation and more or less prohibited filming during class. In a private conversation to his pupils (which the other studios overheard), the professor promised to tone the rhetoric down but maintained the frankness of his critiques. Regardless of the soon forgotten controversy, he had another habit which he shared with his students. Just before studio started, he would often be in line at the famous hotdog cart. 

The hotdog guy and his cart were a long-standing landmark on campus. For years, he stood on fair-weather days at the corner between Maggie Mo and the old Tepper building, catering to professors and students. Archies would frequent it just before studio classes started.  

Those unfamiliar to the professor’s lunchtime habit soon learned it the day that all the second-year architecture studios in the shared crit space in Maggie Mo. In that crowded room, the smells of people's lunches wafted to and fro, though one in particular stood out. That professor didn't have a simple hotdog topped with a small squirt of onions. He must have used the entire jar. Indeed, the onion pieces held together by mustard were slowly dripping off the hotdog, yellowing his teeth and aiming to stain his shirt. 

One poor soul was only a foot away when the old professor leaned in and blurted out his thoughts on the kid's project. Out came a wash of onions in the air, entering the student's nostrils and filling his lungs with the rank stench of the condiment. By the time the professor was done talking, the kid had turned green and seemed on the verge of death. He nodded, then darted back into the hallway, where he leaned over, gasping for fresh air. I can't quite confirm it, but I believe any art students that day must have felt a sense of deja vu as they watched the archies rush one by one into the hall for fresh air. 

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

Is minors worth the hype (and “wasted” units) ,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1fyfoay/is_minors_worth_the_hype_and_wasted_units/,2,6,2024-10-07 19:03:42,"
Fingers crossed my friends and advisors aren’t Redditors, or I’m going to face their scolding and the “I told you last spring” talk.

I entered CMU as a Chemical Engineering major (specifically, a CIT first-year with the intention to major in Chemical Engineering). In the fall, I took Chem 1 (09105) as a corequisite for Intro to ChemE (06100). In the spring, I took Intro to MSE (27100), Intro to MechE (24101), and Chem 2 (09106).

My initial plan was to pursue a dual major in ChemE and MSE, which my advisor immediately rejected, stating it wasn’t feasible. After that, I went through an episode of deciding whether I should be a ChemE major or a MechE major with a minor in MSE.

Right now, I have the weirdest combination of major and minors (MechE/Electronic Materials/Physics). I am taking the typical MechE core classes: 33104 (for the experimental requirements for MechE majors and for my Physics minor) and 33225 (which counts for both my EM minor and Physics minor).

I am kind of drowning in the workload (I have a 61-unit schedule). I considered dropping 33104 and 33225, but doing so would also mean dropping both of my minors, as there’s no way to get back on track for finishing them without completing them in a coordinated manner due to prerequisites and major core units. That would also render a lot of my units “useless.” (I already have 09106, and now 27100 would also be useless since it only counts toward the EM minor).

I also feel restless, and the idea of graduating with just one MechE degree feels nerve-wracking to me. I’m at CMU, where there are endless opportunities, but I would just walk away with one mediocre degree that I don’t even like that much. (In case you’re wondering why I have such a weird combination of degrees, I plan on working in the fusion energy sector.)

I really like 33225, but with the professor not being extremely clear about grading and the schedule of exams, I feel anxious about how the class will turn out. My friends in 33211 have also told me how intense that class is, and I’m taking it in the spring alongside 18100 for my EM minor."

Trouble With Costume History Class- Need Advice ,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1fx1co4/trouble_with_costume_history_class_need_advice/,1,0,2024-10-05 21:53:36,"Hello! I am using a throwaway because this is a specific enough situation for it. I am currently a student taking a required class in the School of Drama where absolutely none of the students know what is going on, and we are really struggling.

I am not a costume design major but I have to take a History of Costume Design class for my grade requirements. The school does not have a designated professor for this class and so we have a guest professor out of state who teaches the class from Zoom. We ourselves are not on Zoom, there’s just a camera at the front of the room for her to see us. 

The professor seems very nice but none of us know what’s going on in the course. The main problem is that we never actually talk about costumes, it’s more like middle school ancient history class with a bonus ‘oh and they wore a tunic’ every 5 slides. I understand why context would be important but it’s basically just her talking about random historical stuff she finds interesting without any of the actual course material. We are not told about distinct costumes beyond something being a tunic/robe or not, and nobody (not even the costume design majors) understands what she is talking about.  
She doesn’t go in chronological order either (again it’s mostly just her rambling about random things she finds interesting), and she also makes several inaccurate statements about things that leads me to not trust her (ie discussing how the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were definitely real when it’s well known that their existence is up for debate, or talking about how men and women have entirely different brains biologically and men are more logical while women are more emotional). We never even know what questions to ask her because none of us even know what to comment on.

Here are some other various incidents I’ve documented in the class:

1. For the first day we were told we were not allowed to take notes and we have to ‘absorb the information in our minds’ instead of academic studying. We were later allowed to take notes again but she does not approve of them. 
2. Our first assignment was poorly-worded enough on Canvas that more than half the class did it incorrectly. When this was brought up to her she got angry and told us “if you want to do poorly that’s on you”.
3. Generally she takes it poorly when we ask questions but also dislikes when we don’t ask questions and talks about how quiet of a class we are…
4. There are 2 other professors and a TA monitoring the course. They have reached out to the professor multiple times because of how often we have come to the three of them discussing how confusing the course is. Nothing has changed.
5. Our midterm is coming up and a student asked what kinds of topics would be on the midterm. The professor said that everything so far is on the midterm, jokingly accused the student of wanting to cheat on the exam, and then said an example question for us is in our syllabus. The example question is a multiple choice question asking us to tell if a piece of fabric is chintz or linen just by looking at a picture. We have never talked about types of fabric in class.
6. The professor does not check her email regularly and is generally incredibly difficult to contact. Contacting the TA is easier but the TA is being bogged down by every student in the class asking her for help. 

Even the costume design majors, as said, don’t know what is going on. After class we all gather in the hallway and talk about just how thoroughly we feel like we are losing our minds. 

We reached out to our advisor about the nature of the course and she told us to reach out to our program head. We are about to meet with our program head to discuss the situation but the program head seems reluctant to interfere.

After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next  generation to discover the character and intrigue of their  institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumnus is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable,  but alas, not believing in gravity  will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

There's a particular elective class that archies try desperately to enroll: Black and White Photography. Short of divine intervention, they always fail to make it past the waitlist, if that option even becomes available for them. Every semester, despite the value it offered to that major, the professors seemed to only permit art and design students into class. One year, a miracle happened, for an archie managed to sneak into the class with his allotted enrollment time. 

He was a shy and quiet Korean lad, but he was so happy to be admitted. He acquired a fancy film camera and started taking photographs in studio and everywhere else he could to get the hang of it.  

One day, he started asking peculiar colleagues with distinguished features to be subjects for his assignment of portraits. One of them happened to be the fox kid, because as he put it, the kid had ""foxy"" hair that always seemed wild and untamed. Thus, he asked and led them one by one to his secret place to take portrait photos: the colonnade rooftop on the side of Maggie Mo.

Yes, the famous small colonnade balcony where the art students took breaks happened to serve archies the same way, before the department had the window openers limited to six inches for [safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/n7f84v/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_7_ice_ice_baby/). Art students below would take a breather, unaware that archies were right above them secretly doing the same thing. 

The Korean student took his portrait photos at an angle so that the roof they stood on never appeared in the photos, leaving people to wonder how he achieved those fantastic views of the campus buildings in the background, and to avoid the tickets campus police were sure to issue to anyone caught on the rooftop. He had his subject do various poses for about five to ten minutes each, then safely had the next subject climb up for his turn. Before any police could bust the impromptu photography studio, he and his subjects were safely back inside, working on their models. Any inquiries were met with blank faces.

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

"Here's why you should register to vote in PA, not your home state. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1fjenmb/heres_why_you_should_register_to_vote_in_pa_not/,186,66,2024-09-17 23:41:21,"https://preview.redd.it/vv6yey3aegpd1.png?width=2814&format=png&auto=webp&s=951bd75be1bba671405fe1ed2ed108588b652b71

A frequent thing I hear from the very smart students at CMU is that they're registered to vote absentee in their home state. 

Don't do this. This image above is a screenshot from [FiveThirtyEight's election forecast](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/). It matches every other expert's understanding of this race. That state in the middle is the one most likely to decide the presidential election. It has been PA for over a year. Your vote will have more of an impact here in PA than ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE US. That is a huge privilege. Take this opportunity to have your voice heard and have youth vote change the direction of this election. **You can literally decide the future of this country.**   
  
Thanks for reading my little pitch. Here's some basic questions answered:  
  
**\*  What if I'm already registered in another state?** You do not need to ""unregister"" from your former state. You need to register as a new voter in PA. You'll still receive your absentee ballot from your former state. Do NOT send it in. 

**\* How do I register?** You can register [online here. ](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx)It is clunky. You will need to sign a piece of paper and upload an image of it. Some people find it easier to do a paper ballot. There's a group frequently registering voters by the forbes / morewood crosswalk. They'll help you. 

**\* Am I eligible?** Probably. If you'll turn 18 before 11/5, live in PA by 10/5, and are a US citizen, you can vote. 

* **Do I need a PA License / Penn Dot ID?** No. You can use the last 4 digits of your SSN. That field is either/or despite the poor form design. 
* **Should I vote in person or by mail?** That's up to you! Polling locations are very close to CMU and typically quick. If you know you'll be out of town on 11/5, definitely choose vote by mail. 
* **What if I already registered but haven't heard anything?** You can [check your status here](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/voterregistrationstatus.aspx). (You're in Allegheny County, look up your zipcode). The county has been really really slow this cycle at getting applications in. If you filled out your application in August and it's not up to date, register again. There is no penalty for it. You won't be registered twice. Otherwise, set a calendar reminder to check again around the end of September. 

**The last day to register is October 21st.**

**The last day to request a mail-in ballot is October 29th.**

  
Pssst - Tell your CMU friends! Got friends at other PA schools? The same goes for them!
 

ETA: this post has obviously been found by trolls attempting to suppress your vote. You'll note none of the comments about it being illegal (that I've checked so far) are accounts that post or comment in CMU. 

To be clear - it is not illegal for you to register to vote in PA where you now live. And if I were you, I'd ask myself why me voting in this state is so threatening to trolls that they'll come out in force to stop me from doing it. Here is the state website clearly telling you that you can. https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/voter-support/college-students.html#outofstate

I am on track and preparing to transfer, and I have talked to my current advisor and my possible future advisor in IS. I know admission is competitive, which makes me worried that I will me stuck in StatML. It really is not something I can see myself pursuing and getting a career in. I want to do something in the business world, but incorporate technology, like IS.

Are there other similar options I have within Dietrich aside from StatML if I don't get accepted into IS? Is trasnferring into IS likely for me? Am I cooked?

the course ended up not being offered in the spring, so now i’m taking a 12 unit course alone by itself with nothing else, will have to dish out the tuition for it, and worst of all, had to turn down a return offer for it because i couldn’t move due to having to stay in person for it. my advisor said a few months ago before graduation that he will waive the course for me and i have proof in writing of both the mistake and his intent to waive the course. 

he left the university without ever waiving it despite me following up on it, i was told it was fine and he will waive it. my new advisor said its a requirement and cannot be waived. so now im stuck wasting 4 months doing nothing productive and will have to dish out the tuition for it at no fault of my own. 

i went to everyone i could think of including the dean of my college (cmu qatar), and was given no help whatsoever. is there anyone from pittsburgh i can reach out to, possibly the information systems committee or similar that can help me waive the course? course is 17313. any help would be greatly appreciated.

I’ve tried several clubs, and they are either inactive or not for me. I don’t fit in with any of the stem kids or any of the minority focused groups, no matter how hard I try.

After all this time, some memories  deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character  and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumnus is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable,  but alas, not believing in gravity  will not grant  you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

Third year is often the pivotal year where architecture students begin to survey sprawling sites within the city. How each goes about preparing for such an endeavor is certainly unique. One fellow may don hiking boots and carry a compass for the first time since graduating from the scouts, not that he should get lost in a simple acreage of wood surrounded by million-dollar homes. Another may inhale his favorite vice when the professor wasn’t looking and venture alone into the pocketed wilderness completely out of his mind. Couples may try to make it a semi-romantic excursion, volunteering to explore remote areas on their own and praying that no ticks ruin the affair.

Of the various ways to approach this semester project, the one thing all architecture students had in common was the requirement to document the entire site in transverse sections from one end to another with notes, photographs, and a combined video showcasing the journey. These raw files were to be collected in studio. People thought of nothing to dump all their data into the server project folder.

Selected students within the groups would then playback the video and start to organize the final showcase. Unfortunately, some were surprised to find out their phones had not stopped recording after finishing their parts of the walkthroughs. A few moments of questionable legality (such as climbing on train cars in a railroad siding) were caught but quickly dismissed. However, the most scandalous event on that trip was caught by just the microphone when one couple had a little free time in the woods and tucked their phone back into a pocket, unaware it was still recording.

As the rest of those in studio listened in horror past the point of no return on the clip, the two of them apparently blushed in awkward humiliation, unable to reach over and delete the file. The audible but blind betrayal of their secret date was mixed with jeers and laughter from their classmates, who found the whole thing hilarious.

   Granted, that portion of the file was graciously never included in the final presentation; however, word soon spread to the other studios, where colleagues found a good laugh and even better reminder to always check their phone cameras are turned off.

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

It's a great day to become a PA Voter! PA voters have more voting power than the vast majority of the country, so use it well! There's a super high chance this Presidental election will come down to a few thousand voters' decisions in PA. 

This year, you'll be voting for the Senate, House, State Senate, and State House in addition to the presidency.

* **""But I want to vote in my home state!""** It's ultimately your choice, but let me tell you, if you want your vote to have an outsized say on the election, vote in PA. You do not need to ""unregister"" from your former state. As long as you do not vote in both, you only need to register in the new state.
* **Where to start?** [ PA Voter Services](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/SurePortalHome.aspx) site can help you register, sign up for a mail-in ballot, and check your registration status and polling place.
* **Info changed?** If you moved or had a name change, you can update your registration through the [Voter Registration ](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx)link.
* **New to PA?** The rules are that you must live in PA for 30 days before the 11/05 election, so if you'll move in by 10/5 and are a US citizen, you can vote. Congrats!!!! Bring your ID to the polls, or the registration card they mail you! You need it for the first time voting.
* **Can I register to my dorm?** Yes! The dorm address is your residence, and your student mailbox is the mailing address. 
* **Do I need a PA License / Penn Dot ID?** No. You can use the last 4 digits of your SSN.
* **Moving after 10/5?** Technically, you need to live at the registered address for 30 days before the election. If possible, vote in your former precinct or request a mail-in ballot.
* **Turning 18 on or before 11/5?** Congrats, you get to vote! You can register now as long as you will be 18 by election day. Bring your ID to the polls, or the registration card they mail you! You need it for the first time voting.
* **Got a criminal record?** Unless you'll be in a penal institution for a felony, or committed an election fraud crime within the last for years, [you can vote in PA](https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/cor/resources/rights-laws-regulations-and-acts/voting-rights.html).
* **Homeless?** You can still register to vote. There's a map on the registration form for you to mark. Let me know if you need help. It's a little weird.

**The last day to register is October 21st.**

**The last day to request a mail-in ballot is October 29th.**

If you've got questions or have any trouble, comment and we'll sort it out. I do voter registration and know people with 30+ years experience in the elections process."

Tales from the Soarch Tattler No. 99 The Mad Russian,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1f2ncdo/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_99_the_mad/,0,3,2024-08-27 17:47:27,"Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumnus is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

There’s an unspoken animosity between the years in Soarch that can make a cold war hot with different accounts making the same people appear as villains or heroes to their own cliques. The upper years at one point expected freshmen and sophomores to help build their final models and drawings under the guise that future freshmen will repay the favor. The lower years would try to up the ante in shenanigans that would make seniors blush. However antagonistic, the general rule was to never damage another year’s work.

Some third years celebrating their new found ability to legally drink forgot that rule when they ambled into the Maggie Mo second-year studio one late evening before a presentation. Hardly anyone was there at such a late hour, save for the usual “live-in-studio” types that were either way behind in work or going overboard in the details. The tipsy trio stumbled and slurred their jeers as they mockingly pointed at the work pinned on the walls. Then they took to looking at the models. I can’t quite say if it was initially intentional or not, but one of them broke a model. Then in their drunken delinquency, another model part broke. Giggles ensued, then panic.

It was at this moment that the second year’s gentle giant went berserk. The normally eccentric but quiet Russian kid turned into a roaring, raving grizzly bear, chasing the third years out with a diatribe of profanity and more. They fled but did not forget their embarrassment of being ejected out of the underclass studio.

Soon after, they went to the architecture office and cried their crocodile tears while telling the advisor or whoever would listen about that mean kid who threatened them in Maggie Mo. An investigation was launched. The Russian student was questioned. It was his word against their tears.

By a miracle, he wasn’t expelled but he was put on the [blacklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/soarchtattler/comments/17vto1f/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_86_the_blacklist/) as a “do-not-hire” and all the studio professors were made aware of his “threat of violence,” including professors who practiced in the city. He was forever known within the department as a potentially problematic kid.

However, word of what really happened did whisper about in studio and many felt sad for the kid. His only alternative course of action would have been what? To let them destroy his colleagues’ work? To call campus police? By the time they arrived, the damage would have been done and they could have collectively pointed at him for worse. I can never vouch for violence nor threats, but even I, as his studio mate, came to understand his dilemma once told of the event.

While there was no way to save his reputation in the eyes of the department, there was a quiet appreciation by his colleagues because their work was saved by his quick response. That batch of third year since then kept their distance and never tried again to break the unspoken rule. As for the mad Russian himself, he graduated and went on to work in digital media somewhere in the Northeast, hopefully with people wise enough to not poke the bear.

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

EDIT: My question was answered by an email. 

""In terms of textbook, use James Stewart's ""Calculus Early Transcendentals"", either edition 7, or edition 8, or edition 9. It can be a hard book or a pdf file. The WebAssign version is not necessary. In the past the WebAssign version was cheaper, I am not sure that it is still the case. Just make sure that multivariate calculus is included (I saw that there is a single-variable only version, you do not need that)."""

Tales from the Soarch Tattler No. 98. The Secret Generator ,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1ex0htl/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_98_the_secret/,7,2,2024-08-20 16:45:36,"Grab a chair and lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumnus is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

Deep within the lower basements of Maggie Mo and behind steel doors lies a hidden generator, massive in size and power. The machine could power the entire building and more using just biofuels yet it has been oddly silent for years, slowly succumbing to the effects of time and disuse. Now, it was never a private endeavor but the result of grant money being allocated for what turned out to be a single-use project, for now.

Government funding and Soarch go hand-in-hand more times than the top brass would care to admit. For Soarch's civilian projects, this money can end up being the primary means of funding Masters and PHD research, hence the careful selection of topics that would be most likely supported when submitted to Uncle Sam's collection of country-wide project applications.

According to one professor, a student once had the idea of experimenting with various types of sustainable fuels as a power source for buildings. Thus, they submitted the project and it was granted funding. Engineers apparently built the generator's engine to handle various fuels from diesel to kitchen oil. The researcher had quite the time and was able to use the motor for his research; however, as soon as he finished his project, the generator saw no more use. It grew quiet and forgotten, a sizable investment no longer needed.

Rather than mark it as wasted funds, that professor continues to inform new grad students about it, in the hopes someone might find a use for it in their research projects. All the hardware is still there, and some still remember the delicious smell of french fries in the air when it ran on kitchen oil. Hopefully, someone will catch up on the offer and relish the opportunity for that kind of research. 

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

How to *Actually* Succeed In 21-127/128/15-151,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1ew27mi/how_to_actually_succeed_in_2112712815151/,91,6,2024-08-19 13:46:09,"This is a (admittedly somewhat long) guide for incoming CMU students who want to do well in Concepts of Mathematics. I'm a senior undergrad math major, and I've both taken 21-128 and been a teaching assistant for 21-127. In my experience, **there is one major factor that separates the students who do well from those who don't, and it's probably not what you think.**

Before I say what that one key factor is, let me give a useful preliminary:

One reason this class is so tough is because homework and exam questions will seem *completely foreign* to many people, even after becoming well-versed in definitions and theorems. A very common complaint after the first midterm is:

""How were we supposed to solve all those questions in 50 minutes? I swear we never learned how to solve #A!""

This thought is often completely correct. You haven't learned how to solve many of the problems you will see on exams and homework. This isn't like the math classes you are used to, where if you spend three weeks doing derivatives and integrals, you can be sure that derivatives and integrals are going to show up on your exam, just with different numbers and letters in different places.

In this class, you write proofs. It's perfectly ok if you don't know what that means yet, but it means you'll have to *discover* the answers to problems, in the most fundamental sense of the word. You are not carrying out processes you have already been taught, you are finding a new way to combine ideas you've learned to construct a path to an answer. There are almost always a variety of correct answers to these questions.

Students who can correctly solve most or all 5ish exam problems in a 50 minute exam are those who can take the many ideas they have been introduced to over the weeks, pick out the useful ones, and apply them in the right order to construct a path to the answer. Many people get stuck trying to find useful ideas, and others get stuck applying them in a meaningful way.



**Ok, so what separates those who can succeed in that process from those who can't? How can you learn to pick out the useful ideas and apply them correctly?**

Here's my answer: *Abstraction*. The ability to efficiently and deeply abstract concepts.

Some people call this intuition, but that's not quite what abstraction is.

When you have *abstracted* a concept, you have understood it so deeply that it is encoded in your brain in special ways. You are able to pick apart the concept, strip it down to its basics, turn it upside down, and see it in ways you haven't before. It's not just mastery of the relevant definitions and theorems, it's a level of understanding that sinks deeper than that.

This is a very vague description, so let me provide an example:

Once upon a time, when you were a child learning how to add, your teacher asked you what 2 plus 2 is. Like any self-respecting kindergartener, you curled your hand into a ball, then put two fingers up, then two more, and counted them. Aha! It's 4.

Now what would you have done if your teacher said you couldn't use your fingers to solve the problem? Well, that's obvious - you'd use your toes. Or pencils. Or you'd draw circles on your paper. You would use *something*. Because you have to, right? Addition is taking a group of things and another group of things and seeing how many things they are together - how else could you possibly solve 2+2?

Now if we gave an assessment filled with single-digit addition questions to your kindergarten self and your current self, both of you would probably ace it. You would certainly be faster, but the accuracy would be the same.

Does that mean your ability to add numbers is nearly the same as your kindergarten self? Except for the fact that you're faster?

Of course not. The way you solve the question is entirely different. You don't *count* anything anymore, because you've abstracted the notion of counting into *numbers.* Numbers are an abstraction that allow you to add without counting. 

Your kindergarten self understood how to add, but they hadn't abstracted it into numbers yet. **Despite this significant difference in understanding, the gap only appeared in the** ***time*** **it took each of you to solve the questions.**

However, if both of you were given another assessment that now contained three-digit addition, you would ace it just as easily, while your kindergarten self would be stumped.

In this class, you will go through many small abstractions that continually build on each other. 

Some of your peers will be just like the kindergartener - they will solve the homework problems and believe that their work is done because they got them right. Others will be the grown-up in the analogy, who can work to abstract and understand the concepts on a level that allows them to build upon them in the future in a way the kindergartener cannot. 

In the early stages, those who have abstracted will usually just solve questions faster than those who have not.

But once the topics get harder and require more abstraction, the differences will become stark. In the same way that someone who fails to make the abstraction of numbers has no hope of ever understanding the further abstraction of algebra, students who fail to make abstractions of fundamental concepts early in the course will be unable to fully understand the later concepts. 

**Don't be the kindergartener.**

To someone who has abstracted all the concepts fully, Concepts of Mathematics exams are *easy.* I do not speak lightly. Why? Because the exam questions require you to extract the essence of ideas you've seen before and use them in new ways, which is exactly what abstraction lets you do. With abstraction comes intuition for how to extract ideas and which ideas to apply to which problems. Of course, don't expect the exams to be easy in any case - I only achieved that level of abstraction for these topics well after I completed the course. But that doesn't mean you can't improve your ability to do well on exams.

Abstraction is a slow process that you cannot force upon yourself, and some people are better than others. Here are a few practical pointers to improve at it:

1. Rather than just trying to *solve* homework problems, use them for their intended purpose - to help you abstract the concepts. At first, you will have to refer to the lecture slides to remember relevant definitions and theorems. This is fine, but by the time you finish a homework assignment, all those definitions and theorems you used should be engraved in your head, and they should make sense. That is the start of the abstraction process. **Do not fixate on finding the solution to a problem, but on understanding as much as you can about the topic.** If you cheat to get the answer to a problem, you might be hurting yourself more than you realize because you aren't giving yourself the chance to abstract the concepts. Even if you accidentally stumble upon the answer to a problem in a legitimate way, you might be better off spending more time working on alternate ideas or approaches, just so your brain gets the benefit of struggling with the concepts.
2. Spending ""unproductive"" time on homework or review problems is actually very productive. I used to feel angry at myself when I spent three hours thinking on problems and didn't make any progress toward a solution. Truthfully, all that time I spent mulling over how a definition/theorem could be used or applied was working to encode the ideas into my head in different ways, working through the abstraction process. While those homework assignments felt like hell, the later exam questions felt like a cakewalk because of the earlier effort.
3. Test yourself. With abstraction comes good intuition. Before an exam, see if you can explain every definition you've learned in the simplest way possible, avoiding jargon. For proofs you've seen in class, see if you can recall what key ideas are needed to make them work, and why they are needed. Ask yourself ""What if?"" questions to push your understanding further. Some examples are ""What if this homework problem also had this additional requirement in it? Would it still be true? What would the proof be?"" If you spend the day before the exam cramming the definitions or reading over the homework solutions trying to burn them into your brain, it's too late. For that exam, at least. Abstraction is slow, and it's not too difficult to tell if you've missed the mark. Test yourself periodically and see if you're keeping up. If you don't, the exams will surely tell you.

That is all. I cannot stress how much of a difference abstraction can make. It is something you can work to get better at and it is an invaluable skill in most technical fields. Let me know if you have any questions, comments, or doubts about this - I'm happy to answer :)

After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumnus is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

There used to be a grizzly old school head who shaved his beard based on the equinoxes. Don’t ask me why but it was one of own peculiarities that he’d like to point out to others. Another was this old tale he’d always tell the students working as the summer cleaning crew.

Back in the 1970s when he was an architecture student here, the man used to date a lass who was always traveling to and from the airport and he used to share an apartment with a roomie who was likewise always travelling. Between constantly picking up or dropping off his girlfriend and his roommate, he found he had hardly any quiet time to sleep in the apartment, much less do his homework for studio. The roomie’s Japanese girlfriend, however, did not travel and was just as busy on campus as the tired archie.

One night, an idea popped in his head. The man proposed that his roommate switch girlfriends with him so that the travelers can travel together while those that stayed behind did not have to always be a taxi for them. Remarkably, the roommate and both ladies all full-heartedly agreed to the new arrangement. The swap worked and the old former school head remains married to his switch to this day.

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

Also is there any way these courses will be shifted to bigger classrooms to accommodate more students.

I'm a math major currently facing a tough course load and I'm seeking some urgent advice on course selection.

For a non-technical course, I'm considering:

1. **Dangerous Ideas in Science & Society**
2. **Global Business**

I'm looking for a class that's an easy A since my schedule already includes some very challenging courses. Which one of these would you recommend?

Additionally, I'm confused about my technical course options:

* **Physics I for Science Students**
* **Physics I for Engineering Students**

I already have AP credit for Physics I for Engineering, but according to CMU rules, I can't use AP credit for gen-ed requirements. How should I proceed with this? Any insights on how this AP credit might still be useful if i choose the engineering version?

I took BC Calc junior year of high school and received a 5/5, so I have credit for 21-120 and 21-122. After junior year, I took IB HL math (covering some proofs, vectors, matrices, and diff eq) and got a 6/7 on the exam.

transferring out of BXA,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1e1mv6d/transferring_out_of_bxa/,0,2,2024-07-12 17:06:33,"I'm an incoming freshman and was admitted to the BXA program for BHA with the school of art (fine art). I was initially excited for the bxa program because I wanted to also study EHPP along with art but as more time goes by I realized that I really want to spend more time in making art and instead of doing bxa maybe minor in EHPP  
  
But because of the BXA program, when I was planning my courses with the help of my advisor, she advsied me to take 2 foundation courses this semester as this leaves room for a class in DC for my academic concentration. however, I was thinking since I really would love to spend more time doing art and maybe even transfer out of BXA, how many foundation classes am I required to take to graduate with a BFA? If it is 6 then I would have to take 3 this semester but then would I not be meeting the BXA requirements by not taking an academic class in DC? 

To sum it up:  
1. how many foundation classes do i need to graduate with a BFA  
2. can I not take a DC class this semester and only do foundations and FYW  
3. Do you still get to do a lot of art even with BHA? my only concern is that I would not be able to do art as much.. I am still interested in humanities so i do believe that BHA is still a great opportunity for me."

Tales from the Soarch Tattler No. 96 The Spray Booth ,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1e051jb/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_96_the_spray/,4,0,2024-07-10 19:48:16,"Grab a chair and  lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount  some of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School of Architecture.  After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumnus  is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you  the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

There used to be an ongoing battle between architecture students and their school. The former desperately wanted a place to spray paint their models and the department would always deny the request. This would embolden some students to find secret places to spray paint their models and claim it was done “off campus.” The constant markings on the back stairwell to the right of Maggie Mo said otherwise. The apparently “true” reason was because a professor on the floor below was highly allergic to the fumes of spray paint, thus the university did not want to risk exposure and legal liability. Yet, once a kid spray painted her models on the grand exterior granite steps, it became clear that the department had to give the students what they needed.

Thus, the spray booth was erected in Maggie Mo in the furthest regions of the third floor, with its own ventilation hood and filter pointing to the daycare playground, lest the office of that professor in question should receive the fumes on his side of the building. It was a grand steel-lined spray booth and models of various sizes fitted inside without trouble.

However, trouble did come in the form of new mischief. Adjacent to the spray booth was the newly added single stall restroom with acoustic tile. Over the semesters, students would steal the tiles and paint them in the spray booth before reinstalling them in the bathroom. Now it was not as good as the Sistine Chapel, but some of that cosmic art was quite interesting.

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

In the past few weeks I've been on linkedin and reached out to a few people already at Tepper and asked them for advice on my schedule and teachers, clubs, etc. so I already have a pretty not-totally-ignorant sense of how stuff kinda maybe works.

I've got a few questions for those of you that can take the time to help. i wanna try to plan this year out well and not have any huge regrets or be super surprised by opportunities and catch myself wishing that I should have done something so...

1. On maps Mcgill is pretty far from Tepper. Is the method to bike it? e-scooter? 

2. Courses. how does this look for the fall?

**Business science: 70-106**

**Business leadership endeavor 1: 70-104**

**Intro to accounting: 70-122**

**Principles of Microecon: 73-102** 

**Writing about data + public policy: (76-107/108)**

**Multivariate analysis: 21-256**

and i haven't done my spring ones yet. I was also thinking about taking 70-207 (on that, 70-207 or 36-200?) because it looks interesting. 

3. what can I skip with my qualifying aps? Stats, CSP, Calc AB, Human Geo, Music Theory. specifically the first 3.  do some clubs look at aps?

4. I've heard cmu recently made 99-101 so that you can't take it over the summer. will this affect my workload much?

4. double major. Business Admin and statML double major seems very appealing to me but I don't know at all how it will change my path, workload, opportunities, etc. any advice? should i commit to a double major as early as possible? should i take 21-127 because its a prereq to a lot of courses that I may end up liking?

5. i definitely sound overambitious but dual degree vs double major? on that, if I wanted to do a DM/DD would I have to submit another app for it? or maybe only for some like cs bc cmu is goated 

6. genuinely, truly, actually, what is the workload like. like yes our heart is in the work but im talking on a day to day basis if I was just doing a bsba.

7. any underground tips you only learnt when you began to live at cmu for a while that would have helped had you known them earlier?

8. What does being a student at CMU get you in the city of pittsburgh? discounts, hacks, etc.

9. literally anything else

Thanks for any advice! if yall need me to clarify anything lmk!"

"Students Charged Nearly $10,000 FOR WATER BILL in 3 person apartment! ONE ON CENTER IS A DISASTER.
",https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1dwbmyx/students_charged_nearly_10000_for_water_bill_in_3/,140,57,2024-07-05 23:26:51,"DO NOT RENT AT ONE ON CENTER!!! IT LOOKS VERY NICE, IT IS A DYSFUNCTIONAL DISASTER RUN BY CON ARTISTS. MANY OF MY FRIENDS HAVE HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES AND HAVE EITHER LEFT OR REGRETTED RE-SIGNING.  
***EDIT: The situation has since been resolved, our landlord refunded us after I made an offical demand for repayment and threatened litigation. I will keep everyone updates if this situation evolves. I find that I'm eligable for compensation due to this neglegence, I my consider litigation in the near future. For now our money is back and we are extremely greatful for all the support we received.***

Key Points:

1. Me and two other students (1 is a CMU guy, rest are Pitt students) in a 3 bedroom apartment have been charged collectively exactly $8,745.47 for water and sewer alone in 2 monthly payments. The landlord justifies this bill firmly and will not even temporarily refund us a single dollar, as they deny any discrepancy. I cannot access the payments before May on the resident portal & requested an itemized account.
2. The landlord  says the issue started April 5th and provided the attached Excel Spreadsheet with the highlighted yellow columns displaying the justification for the enormous bill. These highlighted numbers sum to 293,780 total gallons of water. THEY ARE CLAIMING IM RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR CYCLING TOILET SOMEHOW USING 293,780 GALLONS OF WATER.
3. I was in contact with conservice who explained their records indicated our usage totaled 130,800 gallons for May-June and 11,224 gallons for June-July. They did not mention anything else consistent with the landlord's provided spreadsheet. 
4. Jamie Kronberger is the ""Community Manager"" for the building and is the person we've interacted with the most. Her extremely frustrating email response is exactly as follows w/my name reacted although it's not hard to figure out who I am if you know me:

""Hi,

Attached is the daily water use ledger for your unit from April, May and June.  As we noted yesterday, our maintenance team repaired the flowing toilet in your room on June 14th.   As you can see that coincides with an immediate drop in the water usage.  Based on the usage data the toilet was clearly started running on April 5th.  It is the responsibility of the resident of the room to submit a work order when any item is not operating correctly. 

 

Conservice is reaching out to PWSA to see if there are any credits or rebates they can offer.  I will update you when I hear back from them.  If you have any questions, I will be in office on Friday from 10am-4:30pm.

Best, Jamie""

Here's the whole story: Me and my roommates have been dismayed and appalled by our landlord's response to a recent set of 2 water bills totaling almost $10,000 for our 3 bedroom apartment. We EACH get billed equally based on our apartment's total usage, so my roommates also received these absurd charges. I have attached screenshots of my bills specifically on the One on Center resident Portal. These utility charges are identical to those of my 2 roommates. I cannot access the older bills past May on the portal, I am waiting on the building's response to my request for those itemized accounts.

Distraught, we had been collectively contacting the office of our building, One on Center (4500 Center ave, Pittsburgh PA 15213) for over a month, but our landlords have been beyond firm about the bill, and I would describe their response as outrageous, aggressive, and most of all extremely unprofessional. There are two employees in the office who I've interacted with regarding this matter, Jamie Kronberger who is the buildings ""Community Manager"" and Vernon, their ""Leasing Marketing Manager"", who's last name I can't find online, he may use a pseudonym. You can find Jamie easily on linked in, she worked for CMU's housing department because she passive aggressively said ""she wanted to work with nicer students"" when I asked if they fired her for incompetence. 

They have been extremely inconsistent, beginning by telling my roommates not to pay the bill, but refusing to refund anyone (including myself) who already paid (by autopay) in the meantime and maintaining that the charges are fair. I was in Brazil from May 14th-June 26th, and have only been able to begin confronting them in person the last couple weeks. Their response was initially dismissive, but once I began calling them out on social media Vernon's affect became somewhat sympathetic. They have had maintenance (who always either doesn't show up or shows up late) come by and 'verify' the charges, and refuse to give my money back.

Their justification? They claim the toilet was continually cycling beginning April 3rd and continued for 6 weeks. They claim this is MY TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY for a problem that was not only due to their poor construction and plumbing quality (there are multiple leaks in the building, a massive one related to the HVAC on the 11th floor, in the pipes for the hot tub (which is only available for use during the summer, it's been broken this entire summer), and water collecting in the 6th floor of the garage. 

The problem is that they originally tried to use my being out of the country as an excuse for not reporting this, but now it turns out it happened while I WAS here, and they've tried to gaslight me into acknowledging that there was anything apparently wrong with the toilet (THERE WAS NOT). I REPEAT: THERE WAS NO VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF A PROBLEM WE’RE BEING CHARGED ALMOST $10,000 FOR.

We are students and this amount of money is quite meaningful. I’ve made social media posts and many other residents have come forward stating their similar dismay with the management. My friends who still live here regret resigning, and many of them have moved out. It is essential students and other individuals  looking for a safe, quality, respectful housing environment in Oakland know the business practices of this establishment, and they need to be held accountable. They prey on international students who have no course of action when they are extorted, and run what could be an extremely nice building in an extremely dysfunctional manner.

When I ask CMU to sign said.expience letter, they say CMU faculty (professors and department chair) cannot attest any students' specific abilities and so cannot sign my experience letters. I find it extremely odd that CMU would make this process so difficult, as my colleagues all have an easy time to get the signatures from their school. It also does not make any sense when the experience letter for PERM is supposedly to be a list of individual's skills that demonstrate the need to hire the foreigner, but CMU refuses to sign any such list and only gives course descriptions of the classes I took (which my attorney says is unacceptable). So, I am in the conundrum of not being able to get an experience letter and that if I want to change my job text I need to rerun the PWD again.... (set my progress back 6-7 months, which I really, really do not want to do). Has anyone have similar experiences. Any insight is appreciated, thanks!"

Be wary of taking 79-234 Technology and Society,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1dpijsj/be_wary_of_taking_79234_technology_and_society/,7,0,2024-06-27 04:20:43,"If you're planning on taking 79-234 by Prof. Whitney Laemmli to knock out a gen ed, here's some info about the course: 

Pros: 

* It's clear that the professor is passionate about the course material. She also keeps lectures interesting through short videos (e.g., short films, documentaries, or advertisements) or props (e.g., a can of spam, a piece of charcoal)
* You could genuinely learn a lot from the course since it covers a broad time period and lots of interesting inventions

Cons:  

* The main problem of the course is that the expectations of the course isn't clear, and there's a lack of feedback from the instructor's end. 
* The grading consists of participation, two exams, and two papers. For the exams, I always felt like I couldn't be certain on what content was going to be tested. An entire question could be on some minute detail that was mentioned offhandedly in lecture and not even tangentially related to the readings. It often felt like *any* invention in *any* time period for *any* group of people was fair game, and the questions felt like a creative writing/guessing exercise. I got an A in the course, but it felt like good luck rather than me feeling that I actually understood the content. In contrast a lot of my friends who paid more attention in lectures got bad grades simply because the questions were so random
* Before the first exam, students were asked to brainstorm possible exam questions. This sounds like a good idea in theory, however zero guidance was given on how the questions would be structured or even sample questions from the instructor. How many questions would there be? Would they be short questions or long essay questions? Would they ask us to simply recall information, or do in-depth comparisons/analyses? Absolutely no idea
* This also worsens the previous questions about the arbitrary topics the questions were based on. If all \~100 students brainstormed 3 exam questions, and a topic doesn't relate to *any* of them, it's probably a good sign that this topic wasn't discussed enough in the class/important enough to justify making it an entire exam question. 
* When midterm grades came out, the only thing the grade was based on was participation, despite us having completed a midterm and paper at that point. This meant you didn't know how well you were doing in the course if you were thinking of dropping.  
* Even when grades for the paper and exams came out, you get a number and that's it. There's no comments or feedback on your paper. You don't even get your graded exam back so you don't get to see which questions you got wrong / right. Of course, there's also no system for regrade requests. In fact, the final exam and final paper's grades came out on canvas an hour *after* the grade release deadline, so even directly contacting the instructor for feedback is infeasible. If a grading mistake was made on your paper you just have to take the L, not that you would even know about it. I genuinely don't understand why students are left in the dark about their academic performance.
* This sense of uncertainty and ambiguity is felt throughout the course. IMO it's so much worse to have a course whose content isn't inherently hard, but is made arbitrarly hard because you don't know what you should be reviewing. If get fricked in 21-127 by combinatorics, at least I know what I have to focus on, rather than being adrift in uncertainty about what knowledge is essential for success in the course.

Of course, this is just my experience with the course, so take it as you will. "

After all   this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and intrigue   of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many   of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing  in gravity will not grant  you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

Right-handed people never understand the pain of lefties when it comes to using tools. Scissors should be simple for everyone to use and the edge of a razor blade is symmetrical, right? Wrong, just wrong- not that a righty would comprehend a world built without them in mind.

An archie southpaw once acquired his cheeky revenge against this cruel world, or at least against his sneaky colleagues who kept “borrowing” his tools in the Maggie Mo architecture studio. He had a peculiar but plain looking sharpener that never seemed to work except when he used it. Classmates would snatch it and then hand it back after it failed to sharpen their pencils. He would always act surprised and proceed to sharpen his pencil with it in front of them as if nothing was wrong.  It wasn’t until a few weeks later when someone finally noticed his flick of the wrist was in the opposite direction. Lo and behold, some company had produced a left-handed sharpener with the blade on the opposite side of the assembly. The southpaw had quietly acquired it from an art store and used it to trick his classmates for a few good laughs that semester.

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

Some specific questions I have:

* Are dual majors common at CMU, particularly in engineering?
* What are the academic requirements and workload associated with pursuing a dual major in ECE and MechE?
* Have you or anyone you know pursued a similar dual major, and what were your experiences like?
* In your opinion, is pursuing a dual major in ECE and MechE a good choice for someone interested in robotics, AI, and related fields?"

You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability   to fly. So take them for what they are.

During my time at the university, there was an architecture professor noted for three distinct traits. To the tech staff, he was known to enjoy a good rare vintage on the weekend while grading papers. (Sometimes, that is understandable, even to one as religiously dry as myself.) To the architectural history community, he helped a historian with a book about the creation of an architect’s famous house and the client’s family so revealing that the historian was allegedly blacklisted by the foundations that carried on their legacies. To the students, this professor was known simply for writing emails the lengths of novellas in the wee hours of the morning.

I wish that were hyperbole, but the man could make Charles Dickens seem laconic or purple prose seem minimalist. My own unique flourish pales in comparison to his ability to expound the most minute point into an hour’s worth of reading. This of course, led to some exasperation and some cheeky humor with students. He would write a hundred sentences and they sometimes would respond with a simple summary in two sentences as to what exactly it was he wanted, almost as a chiding reminder to be succinct. He never caught on to the mockery as students laughingly read in studio his ever-growing responses to their short synopses and giggled at the odd hours he sent his emails.

The head of the school went one step further; for if you think the students were exasperated by a semester of his verbose typing, the office staff were even more annoyed over the years of his constant communications. One day, the grizzly old school head actually put a limit on his loquaciousness by telling him point blank that the professor would only be allowed to use ten sentences to create his messages to him. Anything longer than ten sentences would be ignored. Period.

Since then, he has complied with the head’s directive. It’s a shame that the students were never given the same privilege of short emails.

 

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

I had an amazing social life there but I always felt like I wasn't surrounded by people who were pushing me to work harder or helping me grow intellectually.  
  
One of the main reasons why I want to attend a top university is because I want to be around people who are much smarter and more hardworking than me so that I get to learn as much as possible from them. I believe CMU offers me a better environment than what I've experienced at Emory.

I'm aware of the hustle culture at CMU, and frankly, excited about it as well. The entrepreneurial and innovative culture at Emory also seems inferior to CMU's.

However, I'm on track to graduate from Emory in 3 years while at CMU I'll start at freshman standing (unaware of how many credits transfer over yet) and will probably take 6-12 months more to graduate than I would've at Emory. Is the extra cost and time worth it? (I'll probably pursue Business, Economics, Entrepreneurship/AI at CMU)"

So I I just wanted to have an idea of what are my chances of getting into CMU for PhD or masters on a fully funded scholarship.

I did my bachelors in cs with a gpa of 3.61/4. I have 1 year of relevant work experience, I also have 3 publications one of them being in IEEE Xplore and the other one being in PeerJ Computer Science with a journal Impact Factor of 3.8. I haven't given my TOEFL yet but will give it in the coming month with an expected score of more than 110/120. Furthermore, I have also done around a dozen relevant Coursera certificates. I have also done internships and multiple ta ships during my student life as well as serving as a long term photographer for many student societies. I've also won multiple speech competitions due to decent orating skills. And I have more than 200 solved LC problems

Most of my extra curriculurs revolve around conservation efforts of rare parrot mutations. I also launched a startup with the purpose of educating high school students. 

I know the essays are going be very important and I will milk all of the above details to write an excellent piece of writing.

So having read all of the above I would appreciate if you guys can tell me what are my chances of getting into CMU. Or should I not bother applying if it's out of my league"

The dude has linked (multiple times) a tweet containing his daughter's paternity test results in blog posts he's written for a private sector company.

He's kind of an oddball (has a DJ sitting next to him in this class) so I can't tell if this is some kind of long-running joke he enjoys, or if there was legitimately speculation on campus (as he mentions in the tweet) that his wife's daughter isn't his.

Transfer questions (pls help),https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1cwxbvz/transfer_questions_pls_help/,0,7,2024-05-21 02:29:49,"Hi everyone!!

I found out I was accepted Saturday as a transfer student into the Dietrich College of Humanities & Social Sciences for professional writing and I have TONS of questions!!

Im coming from a very small community college in Flint, Michigan, so I'm expecting a huge shift (obviously) in my surroundings. Ive never lived away from home so I'm definitely very nervous going in.

Does anyone have any information regarding housing for transfer students? I know I'm going in as a sophomore, and I've seen that most of the upper-class housing is gone already, so do I even have a chance of getting on-campus housing? Would I be able to be placed in the freshman dorms?

Is anyone here in the professional writing program? Do you like it and how stressful would you consider it? Ive heard good things about the English department so I'm very hopeful!

lastly, what is the driving situation like in Pittsburg? Im get super scared driving in big cities so it's one of my main concerns haha.

Here's my insta If anyone wants to reach out: haileymaria\_

2. Your thoughts on ETIM program outcomes, and the program's prestige in the industry and within university?

3. What's the class size like, and how diverse are the backgrounds and experience of students?

4. How was your experience finding Intern, part-time RA/TA and job opportunities?

1. What are support services like for classes, are they typically from TAs and how much will I be struggling on my own
2. Is it difficult to double major, particular for ECE and EPP? Do people typically complete both within 4 years?
3. How are internship opportunities advertised, and how much are ECE based? I've been browsing the sub and a few people have said that internships (and the school in general) are geared towards SCS—I'm sure it is over started and not very severe, but should it be something I consider or something I will find to be just a vague nuisance?
4. For ECE in particular, how much am I expected to know coming in? I am taking AP Physics C (Mech and E&M) but am struggling a little; would it be helpful to study a bit beforehand or will I be fine following along? I saw some posts saying that Physics II was a bit of a slough to get through.
5. Is there anything else I should know that I haven't asked?

When I looked into the top 20 universities for quantum computing, CMU wasn't listed. The leading universities in this field often have strong physics programs. While watching a YouTube video about 15-459, the professor mentioned not having a background in physics. He also stated that there's no need to know physics or quantum mechanics.

I don't know much about Westwood or Pittsburgh but don't dislike them. Any useful advice is highly appreciated!

UCLA pros

* good food
* good weather
* better ranked math department, more diverse research areas than CMU
* students seem to be happier

cons

* really large population, not sure I will get connected to professors and research opportunities (this is very important)
* overenrollment means classes are hard to get
* might feel overcrowded
* dont really care much for sports

CMU pros

* smaller university than UCLA, more opportunities to connect with professors and do research stuff (this is very important)
* smaller class sizes
* very strong in combinatorics and probability, an area that I have some interest in
* second highest top 500 placements in Putnam for the last few years, and Putnam is something I am interested in
* more math PhDs relative to student population size than UCLA

cons

* algebra and number theory dont have as much faculty as areas like combinatorics, and I currently really like number theory (as of now)
* not as highly ranked of a math department as UCLA, less diverse research
* doubt in departmental perceptions (very vain, I know): whenever I browse posts, they always mention CMU is good for cs, engineering, business, fine arts, but rarely math
* seems quite stressful, but this is the least of the cons listed

I also am considering Berkeley, but I think I like UCLA better, although it does have a slightly higher ranked math dept so maybe somebody could vouch for that."

I tried to retake it again and I’m pretty sure I flopped again, so instead of being sad I decided to try testing out. I really don’t want to take those introductory courses because I’ve taken calc BC and multi variable calculus already and I feel like it would be going back too far - I did pretty good in class too so I don’t think I need to retake them.

I know that both programs are great, but I want to make sure I make the right decision and am fully informed about the program I choose. I was hoping to get some insight as to which choice would be better for me not only during college, but also after.

Here are some of my preferences regarding school: I probably won’t be participating as much in the party scene or greek life, but I still want to be in a social environment. I don’t really care much about the weather. I do want to travel abroad and obtain job/ internship opportunities in and out of school. I don’t want too artsy or too technical of a program, somewhere in the middle.

Now I’ll give more details for why I am struggling to make a decision:

Syracuse:

Pros: $10,000/ year scholarship, highly accredited (and ranked) architecture program, I like their arch building, I like the student work, good study abroad (NYC, Florence, South Korea, Japan), better connections with professors

Cons: very cold, not much in the surrounding area, 140 incoming architecture freshmen (very big class), less prestigious as a whole, professors only teach and aren't active in the field



Carnegie Mellon:

Pros: near city, professors are active in the field, well rounded school, only around 50 incoming architecture freshmen, 1 year study abroad at Singapore's NUS, better location

Cons: QOL not the best (?), more technical focused program (?), couldn't find many images or videos of student work or the facilities themselves



I understand that money does play a part in making a decision, but I would like to know about the programs themselves and which one would potentially be best for me.

cmu or usc (please help D:),https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1cqlw41/cmu_or_usc_please_help_d/,18,39,2024-05-13 00:07:11,"i love both schools but for completely different reasons—i've committed to usc because my parents strongly prefer it but they've emphasized that i can still back out if i change my mind (the cmu deposit deadline is later than usc's). im a deeply indecisive person so advice is appreciated! at both schools, i plan to go into ece.

cmu pros:

* prestigious for engineering as a whole and my major
* seems to have really good job placements according to [https://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html](https://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html)
* amazing for robotics (which i love!), lots of robotics-related clubs and research :D
* a ""better degree""

cmu cons:

* from California so the weather and city will be hard to adjust to
* worried about burning out and stress culture, though i feel like 
* not as diverse (?)
* expensive, will be paying full price \~85k
* smaller campus which might feel constricting

usc pros:

* well-balanced lifestyle and student life
* alumni network
* honors housing
* got half-tuition scholarship, so will be paying 60k all four years!
* lots to do in LA!
* larger, overall nicer campus

usc cons:

* not as good for my major, but not awful either?
* not as big on robotics but there are still quite a few robotics labs
* frat/party culture (not much of a partier, im more introverted)
* surrounding area has a reputation for being a little shady
* potentially not as good job placements, though employment rates between the two schools seem around the same

my biggest worries are job placements and technical ability (both schools are apparently top feeders to tech companies [https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/top-feeders-tech](https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/top-feeders-tech) but im not sure about the site's credibility). i like to think i work hard and love what i do, and i want to be surrounded by equally motivated people. my teachers and engineering friends all think cmu is a no brainer, while my parents and their friends prefer usc for its lifestyle (my parents worry about my health and want me to be happy more than anything). ill be posting this in a few subreddits as well - thank you for your help!"

I am a rising final year computer science student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am looking into PhD programs at GT as well as other universities. Out of all of the potential graduate programs I've found, CMU is the only one which requires GRE scores. Thus, I want to compare myself to the profile/background of a typical admitted PhD student to determine whether I have a realistic chance of being admitted.

Tales from the Soarch Tattler No. 93. The Fox Hat and Fox Song,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1cn9d3o/tales_from_the_soarch_tattler_no_93_the_fox_hat/,0,0,2024-05-08 16:50:37,"Grab a chair and  lend me your ear (technically your eyes) as I recount some  of the legends, lore, and deepest secrets of the School  of Architecture. After all this time, some memories deserved to be archived for the next generation to discover the character and  intrigue of their institution's past. As a survivor of architorture, this alumni is glad to write as many of them down that can be recollected. You might find these stories  unbelievable, but alas, not  believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

One Christmas, a fourth year was gifted by his family a peculiarly lifelike hat featuring the face of a fox. Its beady eyes seemed to follow you and those faux furred ears were visible from a mile away. I would not say the kid was obsessed with foxes 24/7 but as mentioned in true tales before, just saying you want a pet fox someday does encourage others to shower you with fox-themed gifts every year.

Fortunately, that winter in the steel city was cold and the fox hat did a good job of keeping his human head warm. It earned quite a few chuckles on the bus and on campus but there was one place where it drew ire from humorless adults: Maggie Mo.

Every morning, the daycare workers at the basement kindergarten center would string up the kids and lead them on a little walk around the building. By the time they reached the front colonnade of the building, the man with the fox hat would walk out the front door on his way to another class. The kiddies would see the hat and break out in unison, singing that one hit wonder of a fox song by Ylvis.

The daycare workers groaned for it would be another day of the kids singing it nonstop. This infernal torment for them continued well into the semester and stopped only when spring finally drove old man winter away. By then, the fox hat was substituted with something far less warm, but still well eared for the man’s reputation for wearing funny hats. 

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

If there would be a better major for me, please let me know.

StatML is the best major so far to me since it is more quantitative and involves some cs which I like (though not to the point of solely pursuing it). Also, it seems you can't have a double major where the second major is in Dietrich unless it is a certain few majors that I'm not interested in. Any information/advice would be appreciated!

- Personally acquainted with my music professor 
- admitted to BSA
- I love the campus there
- a lot of supportive and kind people

CMU cons:
- 90k/year (possible to pay but still expensive)
- May have to transfer from BSA to BESA to switch major to chemE (have to maintain at least 3.0 GPA)

CWRU pros:
- easy to switch majors
- 60k/year (cheaper than CMU)

CWRU cons:
- the admissions seems to have poor support for students (tried contacting them multiple times, never felt positive interacting with them)
- less known compared to CMU (May affect my job market?)
- campus is not my favorite


Do you think the yearly 30k difference is worth it for CMU? I love the school and my parents are willing to pay for it but it still is a HUGE sum of money..(please let me know any positive/negative experience you’ve had at CMU)

I'm excited to share a project that I've been working on—[CourseScope CMU](https://course-scope-cmu.com/), a new platform designed for our community. It's aimed at giving all of us a better look at the courses we're considering.

**What's** [CourseScope CMU](https://course-scope-cmu.com/)**?** It's a place where you can view and share detailed ratings and comments about CMU courses and instructors. Whether it's the workload, teaching quality, or the fairness of grading, you can find out what your peers really think and share your own experiences.

**Why use this when we have FCEs?** While FCEs are invaluable, [CourseScope CMU](https://course-scope-cmu.com/) offers:

* **More comprehensive metrics** on various aspects of courses
* **Real-time updates and interactive discussions**
* **An informal, student-driven environment** that might capture more candid feedback

**Your input matters!** Right now, we need more course ratings to build a robust database. Your insights will help fellow and future students make informed decisions. Plus, engaging on the platform can help foster a stronger CMU community.

**Join the conversation!** Drop your course feedback, browse what others have said, or just check out the site at [CourseScope CMU](https://course-scope-cmu.com/). Looking forward to seeing your reviews and hearing your feedback on the site itself. Let's help each other make the most out of our CMU experience!

---

Thank you for your concern about security. I would like to clarify some points about how CourseScope CMU handles your data and authentication:

1. No Andrew **passwords** required or stored. The platform does not require nor store any Andrew **passwords** (your CMU credentials). Users are prompted to create a unique password for CourseScope CMU that is entirely separate from their CMU credentials.

2. Open-source transparency. For those who are technically inclined, our entire codebase is open-source. You can review the codebase at [GitHub](https://github.com/liamt01/course-scope-cmu).

3. Email verification only. The only use of your Andrew ID is for sending an activation link to your CMU email to verify that you are a current student. This ensures that all reviews and ratings are contributed by the CMU community.

Thank you all, and I am open to any further questions or suggestions."

Question from an incoming freshman: Stever or Morewood gardens?,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/1ckkyyp/question_from_an_incoming_freshman_stever_or/,2,4,2024-05-05 06:34:03,"Hi guys!
My roommate and I are currently filling out the housing application and we were stuck between which dorm to rank first: Stever or Morewood gardens? We’ve done lots of research but we still aren’t able to fully decide.

Through the past Reddit posts I’ve seen, most people talk about Morewood e-towers but i haven’t heard much about a freshman’s experience at Morewood gardens - it would be great if anyone could comment on that. We were mainly worried about the social scene at gardens since it’s both a first year and upper class dorm. 

Also we were worried about the size of the stever rooms since they look pretty small and cramped in the YouTube videos - also we’ve heard that Stever dorms have really thin walls? If anyone could comment on that as well it would be great!!

Additionally, would you say that semis are better than communal bathrooms in terms of convenience?

If there’s any other reasons why one would pick morewood over Stever or Stever over Morewood, please let us know!!! Thanks in advance for any replies!"
