OSU veteran office,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1gw0h26/osu_veteran_office/,1,6,2024-11-20 21:54:00,"Good afternoon, 

  
Quick question for my veteran folks on campus, 

  
Is it just me, or does it feel like the Veteran Office isn’t really offering much support?



I recently got out of the Navy and was accepted into the CIS program for the upcoming term. Over the past two weeks, I’ve reached out to the Veteran Office multiple times via email, and there's no response at all.



When I finally received a reply, I was only told that they would send me paperwork for my GI Bill after I schedule my classes—nothing else. I specifically asked for help transitioning to academic life or the community and inquired about resources like housing or general advice, but I got nothing.



To make matters worse, even after explicitly requesting assistance, the only follow-up I received was, “I’ll have a veteran peer reach out to you tomorrow.” That hasn’t happened yet.



Am I expecting too much? For the first time, I’m questioning my decision to accept the offer at OSU.

OSU is putting way too much onto these maintenance workers bc when i told him i saw mold behind the wallpaper and it was likely inside and behind the whole wall, he told me it was beyond his authority (which i completely understand) to fix. but it's the fact OSU is only sending these maintenance ppl to deal with this when this is not even what their jobs are for. 

i personally have been dealing with weird headaches and insane fatigue all semester along with a runny nose, sneezing, skin problems etc. and then i go home and it gets drastically better. i'm not a sickly person at all and i genuinely have felt terrible good chunks of this semester and am even having serious trouble with sleep. i've gone to doctor's appointments and everything and could not understand why this was happening to me. all of this and ohio state is still trying to deny the severity of the mold problem in this building and didnt offer to move us out as an accommodation rather than forcing us to be in a room where there is a pretty severe mold problem. this is actually ridiculous because you know damn well they were aware of this for a long time but just want to rip people off and invest as less money as they can! thanks for your negligence ohio state, i'm really hoping this doesn't have any long lasting health effects and this can all go away once i move out of this hell hole "

They said they were here to verify if by state procedure if I wanted a protection plan which makes sure I got lower electric (Aep power rates). This didn't sound right to me but when i went on the bill, it does say that ""For tariff 015, in order for you to save money off of your utility's supply charges, a supplier must offer you a price lower than AEP Ohio's price of $$."" 

I told them no both times and the previous time, I have called AES Ohio and Columbus every time to make sure and they have told me not to trust people unless they give a notice. This time I did not call. However, I have yet to receive a notice so I am confused on how that would look. I just stayed safe just to be sure but this time I did not call my provider so just wanted to ask others. 80% I am right that it was a scam, but I am doubting 20% whether this is just them offering a better price like said on the bill. Thank you for your time.

Obviously, I know everyone doesn't believe that, but I read something in an article that got me thinking more about it. Apparently, one room's towel rack fell off the wall recently, and they deemed it to be due to the mold. One of the towel racks in my room also fell clean off the wall, but it fell in the first couple of weeks of the semester. My bathroom also had wallpaper that was peeling on its own and had a bit of mold behind it. My room is both down the hall and on the other side of 11 and 13, so that leak has nothing to do with the mold problem in my room. Our wallpaper and towel rack have since been fixed, but this problem is way more widespread than the university wants people to believe, and I hope something is done about it.

SLDS Surveillance,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1gqz9ap/slds_surveillance/,1,7,2024-11-14 07:05:58,"I have ADHD and an anxiety disorder that affects me during testing a lot and so I take my exams at  SLDS. Recently I was joking to my friend about the weird shit I do to try to stay focus and she jokingly replied  “don’t go and get a COAM”, and I have been overthinking ever since. 

I knew there was cameras but I honestly completely forgot because it didn’t really matter to me. Now looking back on it, sometimes I need to trace out what I’m thinking about with my finger and I either do it on the table or on my chair. I fidget a lot, I play with pants string, I change my positions often,  I randomly just start tapping stuff as a way to bring myself back to focus. I talk to myself and I waive my hands dramatically while doing so, because it helps me feign interest in whatever question I’m reading. There’s just so much 

Now I’m scared. I was wondering if something happened would I know already? Is this something that I should maybe speak to my advisor about to say how all the moving helps me? 

I’m kind of worried that if I did that I would be told to stop. And I truly believe that being hyper fixated on my fidgeting to make sure I don’t do it would give me a panic attack during an exam. Are the cameras watched all the time or are they only watched when something suspicious happens ?

Sorry if I sound like I’m panicking but it’s because I am ngl. Like I said earlier. Anxiety disorder."

BA CIS Related Field Advice? Combining Courses from Different Departments  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1gpq3y1/ba_cis_related_field_advice_combining_courses/,1,0,2024-11-12 17:26:21,"For the BA CIS program, should the related field courses all from the same department? I know the guidelines say they don’t have to be, but I’m curious about what level of integration is generally acceptable.  



The reason I’m asking is that I’m planning to graduate in May 2025, but I still need 26 of the required 30 major credits completed at OSU. (These 30 credits can be a mix of related field courses or CSE courses.) Since I don’t have a specific related field in mind, I’m hoping to use some of my existing OSU courses to fulfill the requirement and get them approved.  



Previously, I tried to propose this combination under the theme \*“social systems, modern societies, and influence on global relations”\*:  

HISTORY 2650: The World Since 1914  

COMPSTD 3606: Exploring World Literature  

PSYCH 3900: A Practical Guide to Ruling the World  

ENR 2100: Introduction to Environmental Science  

RUSSIAN 3480.99: Surveillance and Espionage from the Cold War to the Present  



I thought they made sense together and would prepare me for roles in public relations, policy analysis, or international studies, but my proposal was rejected. I’m guessing it wasn’t cohesive enough.  



Now, I’m considering narrowing it down to just these three courses:  

HISTORY 2650: The World Since 1914  

COMPSTD 3606: Exploring World Literature  

PSYCH 3900: A Practical Guide to Ruling the World  



The theme would focus on \*“how global power structures and cultural identities are influenced by the interplay of historical events, cultural narratives, and the psychology of influence.”\* I think this focus highlights critical skills for public relations, policy analysis, and global studies.  



That said, I’d love to hear if others have had success with combining courses across multiple departments or if anyone has tips on making the integration stronger. I’m also open to ideas for including more credits! Any advice or examples would be awesome. Thanks in advance! 😊  "

I'm really enjoying how close together everything is, but I am so sick of the limited options at our dining hall (I have absolutely no clue how I'm going to get through Spring semester lol). I'd prefer to live in a more central location with a/c.

I'm a Linguistics major, but I'm not entirely sure where that puts me as far as class locations. I'll have all my GE foundations done this Spring, thankfully.

I'm also looking into joining the Honors program, is it worth it? I applied directly to the Newark campus because I didn't think I'd get in to Columbus (2.57 cumulative gpa, though I did show a lot of growth my Junior and Senior years of high school, and I ended up with a 32 ACT score), and consequently I didn't apply for Honors. But, I've been doing really well this fall (3.7 gpa so far with 16 credit hours) and I want to challenge myself more. I've heard bad things about Honors housing, though. Is it an optional thing?

Overall I'm a bit lost in how to prepare for main campus. I'm in a learning community here at Newark that claims to be helpful in the transition to main, and I'm sure it'll provide me with more information in the Spring semester, but I'm a planner and would like to relieve a bit of the anxiety I have about this.

Bottom line is, I want to participate in research on the Columbus Campus and also partake in a few summer classes, hopefully a math class and a chem class, to amend the fact that I didn't really try in high school and am a bit behind concerning how much math and chem I have done, in addition to having both Gen Chem 1 and 2 done before the fall semester of 2025.

For the campus change part, how would the timeframes work exactly, and how would that interact with the summer class? Just concerned about that because I want to register for summer classes over at Columbus and not sure when I should start organizing a summer term and am not sure on how that would interact with me being of the Lima campus instead of main campus.

I'm also not at all familiar with how the main campus chem department works because of the fact that I'm not there. Should I start cold-emailing professors at this current moment? Should I just... Wait?

I don't have a solid idea YET of what I want to do, since I consider my chemistry knowledge too small to even begin asking big research questions yet, so, any sort of good starting points concerning of what I should look at would be helpful, whether that's certain faculty members or professors that might be open to taking in someone like me.

If there's anything/anyone I should know about the chem department, please do tell as well! Any scrap of information or advice concerning how to transition to the main campus and what to do as a chemistry major is appreciated, though that's not the main goal/question of this post, so understandable if you don't bother with this request.

I probably could have emailed/called the advising department about this, but they're a bit booked at the moment.

If there's anyone that I should've asked instead of reddit, also do tell."

Good evening you all,

So, I got an offer from Purdue for the Computing Systems Analysis and Design major—not Cybersecurity, likely because they didn’t have space for me. Does anyone know the likelihood of transferring to Cybersecurity in the fall?

Aside from that, I also got offers from Ohio State University and UMass Amherst, both for Computer Science. OSU took all my military credits (mostly electives, but still helpful), while UMass didn’t accept any of them. Just a heads-up for my fellow veterans/military folks.🫠🫠🫠

I have a couple of backup offers from Rutgers University and Indiana University Bloomington, which also offered me CS. 


I’m planning to use my GI Bill for whichever I choose.

UMD only offered me admission to Letters and Sciences, saying I didn’t meet the gateway requirements. After doing some research, it looks almost impossible to transfer into my desired program there, so that one’s off my list.

If you are a current or past student, please share a bit about your experience and what you moved onto afterwards in carrier or academia? Was it financially worth it and how do you reflect back? If you ever heard or known about Stony Brook's AMS department and can do some benchmarking, feel free."

I made a post a few weeks back about a guy trying out to outrun campus police. I finally remembered to check the campus crime log and unfortunately, all it says is he was trespassing. But I noticed there was a way to download the last 2 months of data, so I spent a couple hours making it into a map, since I don't think they publish a map?

Some key notes

The locations aren't consistently described, so I did my best to merge what should be together. This includes incidents inside a building, and directly outside of it (like at a dorm's bike rack).

The list included everything from underage drinking and marijuana possession, to felonious assault and rape. I felt it would be silly to count these all as 1 incident, so instead I weighted each incident from 0 to 4, and that is what the map is displaying. Without weighting, the numbers would be on average about 25% lower.

Some reports were outside the area covered by the map, or a unclear location, so those are excluded.

  
Remember this is just 2 months of data so it is heavily affected by outliers. Also some buildings see way more people every day than others. So try not to draw too many conclusions from this."

Update on lawrence tower mushroom,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1gj6d63/update_on_lawrence_tower_mushroom/,228,46,2024-11-04 04:38:20,"Hello all this is the person who had the mushroom grow out of her wall speaking. It seems like everyone on campus including my professors have seen the mushroom picture. SO here is a long update 

**TLDR: A mushroom grew between the wall and wallpaper, maintenance is telling others in the building not to worry, when there is definitely things wrong. Moved from Lawrence -> Park-Stradley.** 

Here is the timeline of events

2am Saturday: The first picture in my original post. I put in maintenance request

10am Saturday: Second picture in og post 

Sunday: Not pictured. A second mushroom sprouted further down the wall in a different wallpaper crack appeared Sunday afternoon and bloomed the next morning. Much larger I was very scared of it. Roommate and I both called the emergency s2f line saying it would be moved up to first on the list tomorrow. 

Monday: This is where I start to get annoyed, some people from Environmental and Health services @ osu come to check out the mushrooms. Right away this lady is super dismissive of my concerns about mold (if there's enough moisture for mushrooms isn't there enough for mold?), I asked at least 5 times for her to peel back the wallpaper and make sure nothing was back there but all she did was lift it up a little and say ""No, there's no mold you just have some growth"" GROWTH??!??! obviously that is not normal. They also whispered the drywall is wet and ""i don't even know if this will dry"". She then asked for a paper towel and some bleach cleaner and ripped the mushrooms out, throwing them out in my trashcan. Which I can understand they might not want to test it but at least take it somewhere else when you knew we were freaked out about it. The other person she was with then asked if we had been feeling alright, and I start with ""Well we sneeze a lot.."" when this lady interrupts me and goes ""well the weather is changing that's just allergies."" when I was about to say ""we sneeze a lot in the room, cough, sore throat, and have red and itchy eyes"". Correct me if I'm wrong are those not obvious signs we're breathing in mold or something bad? They then send in Mike the maintenance man (bless Mike bro he is so nice and very helpful) to seal up the wallpaper with caulking which he did a very good job for what he was working with. I got an email later that day that EHS was coming back the next morning to do ""further moisture evaluation"". 

Tuesday: New EHS people come and I invite them in and the lady goes ""we were hoping there would be no residents while we were here"" and I said ""Oh well I have to leave for class soon anyways but you guys can come in i just need to grab my bag"" ""No, no we'll wait"" so I grab my things and head out the door while 6 people go in behind me. Thought it was a bit sus like why don't I get to know what the tests say but whatever. Anyways I went to class and then went to go study with my friends because I literally had a midterm this day on top of all this and I receive a text asking about meeting up with this lady from housing as soon as possible so we meet up with them, and our next door neighbor comes too so I know this can't be good. She then tells us and our neighbor that we have to move, and that our only option was park-strad. Which at the time I thought was the end of the world because all my classes are on north and we wouldn't have our own bathroom anymore. They said the drywall was wet and they would need to go in and rip it down to make repairs (god knows what they'll find back there). One of the new EHS people from earlier that morning was also at this meeting and she goes ""as for the reddit and social media posts, we don't wanna instill any fear to anyone that lives hear or say that this is a dangerous place"". Queen I feel that every resident in that building has the right to know a damn mushroom grew out my wall so I'm not gonna shut up about it anytime soon!

Wednesday: Moving day! While packing our stuff into the bins I overhear some more maintenance people going to help a girl down the hall with something in her room. I hear them say ""We know your scared after what happened to those girls down the hall but you have nothing to worry about."" which totally rubbed me the wrong way, like why are you telling them how to feel?? They have every right to be scared! That building is old and not that safe to live in come to find out. Anyways the people transported our bins to the new building and brought them up for us. The housing lady that talked to us at our meeting was super nice and helpful on getting us setup. And so was my hall director and RA in lawrence, which was great to have support from them. 

  
While my roommate and I are no longer breathing in mushrooms spores and this whole thing is over for us, it is not for the facebook mothers and people still living in the building. Here are some screenshots from the facebook. The one I find the most alarming is the about the man who worked at the holiday inn before OSU bought it. Like wdym OSU bought a building with mold then decided to put students in it?? And I like how only EHS has inspected the building, not the health department. 

But all I can say is DO BETTER OSU.  DO NOT put students in dangerous in environments just because you want more money. And do not let this situation go quiet, if it does the new students next year will be breathing in the same mold spores as those students are today. 

Thanks for reading,

Mushroom girl

I'm Zoe Brigley Thompson (thompson.3022) and I work in the English department and in Mathematics. I'm poet and I am very interested in the space where numbers and language meet.

 The IMME is is a unique major for what I call unicorns—special students who bridge both left-brain analytical power and right-brain creativity. This is a one-of-a-kind program that prepares you to thrive in today’s interdisciplinary world, blending math’s rigor with the expansive possibilities of the arts and humanities.

**Chart Your Own Path in Mathematics** Choose your focus from one of the four pathways like:

* **Applied Mathematics**
* **Pure/Theoretical Math**
* **Education**
* **Finance/Actuarial Science**

**Enrich Your Perspective with English and Creative Studies** Our complementary English courses are designed to open doors to creativity and communication. Whether you’re a sci-fi fan, an aspiring writer, or interested in digital media, you’ll find courses that help develop your voice and vision, no matter your goals. 

**A Capstone with Meaning and History** Choose from two inspiring capstone courses. Step into the world of *Hidden Figures*, learning about the brilliant Black women mathematicians who shaped history at NASA. Or explore the history of mathematics through the lives and work of pioneering mathematicians who changed the world.

**Why This Major?** This program was created **in direct response to what top employers tell us they need:** professionals with the versatility to ""dance across disciplines,"" as David Epstein writes in his book about people with a varied set of skills: *Range*. These skills are actually in demand for interdisciplinary careers and dynamic industries.

We’re looking for bright, curious minds to join our next class. *Are you ready to be part of something revolutionary?*

I am a current student at BGSU and applied to transfer to OSU and was admitted to main campus.

During my time at BGSU my GPA was a 2.8, still unsure how i was accepted to main campus. BGSU is a big school, however in comparison to OSU it’s tiny. it took me awhile to adjust to BGSU campus as my last two years of HS were online due to covid. I’m really worried i’m not going to do well at OSU due to the campus size and population and extremely limited parking. at BGSU i had the option to drive to class and park in the lot next to the building my classes are in. my brother is a current OSU student and mentioned i will have to parallel park to get to some of my classes. that really concerns me because what if there are no spots? do i just miss class? i’m also very worried about the course material being more difficult at OSU. everyone in my family tells me OSU is much more difficult, so that is my main concern. i’m aware i can get accommodations and plan to do so but im not sure if it will make enough of a difference. also, i do not have any friends at OSU and am worried about walking alone when it is dark (im a girl it’s a real concern okay). i’m at a point in my life where id really like to experience something different and well OSU is definitely different. is there anyone out there in Social Work, and or anyone that has disabilities that are at OSU?

I have a very spooky story to tell and since it is Halloween day, it is a perfect time to tell it! I was never a believer in ghouls, spirits, or the occult, but recently that has changed.

I carved a few pumpkins and left one outside of my door to celebrate the holiday, but the very next day I found a hole cut into the back. It was about a 3 in diameter hole, just big enough for the average cylinder, which was strange because I certainly did not cut that. I figured it was a fluke in the pumpkin and swapped it out for another. The next day, the same thing happened!! This time, there was ectoplasm EVERYWHERE!! On the floor, in the pumpkin, even on my door handle!!

I tried to warn my floor that there was a haunting and to be on high alert, but everyone thought I was crazy!!

Figured I would share in hopes someone knew what kind of spirit I am dealing with.

"Help Choosing Between UMN, CU Boulder, OSU, and Possibly UIUC for Geography/GIS Transfer",https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1gfppxx/help_choosing_between_umn_cu_boulder_osu_and/,0,6,2024-10-30 15:47:48,"Hi Guys!

I'm an international transfer student from China, moving from sophomore to junior year, and I'm looking for advice on choosing between UMN, CU Boulder, OSU, and potentially UIUC. I’ve been accepted to UMN, CU Boulder, and OSU, and am still waiting on UIUC. All of my acceptances are for Geography (or GGIS at UIUC). My long-term goal is a fully-funded PhD in the U.S., and I'm also considering a minor in architecture. Here’s a summary of what I'm weighing for each school:

**UMN**  
**Pros:**

1. Love the cold, snowy winters.
2. Beautiful campus and close to the city for entertainment.
3. Lower tuition and living costs.
4. High transfer credits (59.85), meaning I could graduate in two years.

**Cons:**

1. Lower QS ranking, which may matter if I return to China.
2. Unsure about connections in Geography; only familiar with Yi-fu Tuan’s work here.

**CU Boulder**  
**Pros:**

1. Strong Geography program with highly ranked faculty, good for grad school connections.
2. Proximity to federal institutions, potentially more internship options (assuming no restrictions on my nationality).

**Cons:**

1. Higher annual cost ($77K per year).
2. Lower overall QS and US News rankings.
3. Smaller campus and less urban setting might feel limiting.
4. Not sure how many credits will transfer — could take up to 6-8 weeks to find out — not sure how many years it will take.

**OSU**  
**Pros:**

1. Good reputation in the U.S.
2. A friend there with a car (potentially helpful for transportation).
3. Large campus.

**Cons:**

1. Limited access to nearby Asian grocery stores without a car.
2. Not sure of OSU’s Geography ranking or connections.

**UIUC (waiting)**  
**Pros:**

1. Highest QS ranking, which is beneficial for Chinese job prospects.
2. Large campus with more Chinese students, which could ease the adjustment.
3. Strong computer science program and the possibility to switch to CS+GGIS due to my software background.
4. Great faculty connections, especially Professor Shaowen.

**Cons:**

* Remote location with limited transport options.

My current ranking was UIUC > UMN > CUB, but OSU’s new offer has me rethinking my priorities. Any advice? Thanks so much!"

I have taken a semester of a different language and have not done well and have disliked the professor and class. I was wondering if it would be good for me to take this class instead as I am more interested in getting the world language requirement done than actually learning a new language. I’m ready to put the commitment in to just get it done and over with, plus I have friends with a lot of Italian experience who have said they would be ready to help me with any struggles. TLDR; Is it worth it to take this class just to get the language requirement done quickly vs taking a traditional 3 semesters? Any advice is very much appreciated!"

Mindy Miracle Return ,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1gcm9n6/mindy_miracle_return/,189,10,2024-10-26 14:27:12,"Hi everyone,

We’re overjoyed to share that Mindy was found on Monday (10/21) in Dublin, thanks to a kind person ( an Ohio State student as well) who spotted her in their backyard about a week ago. He took her to the vet to check for a microchip, and that’s how we were finally notified! We’re still curious about where she’s been and how she ended up 11 miles away from home, but we’re just so grateful to have her back.

The first few days were rough – she’s much thinner, had severe diarrhea, and wasn’t eating much. We’ve taken her to the vet twice now, and they found she was dehydrated. Her bloodwork showed a low white blood cell count, so she’s received several treatments and might need to be hospitalized to monitor her condition closely. Thankfully, she’s looking a bit better today, though she’s still not fully recovered.

We’ve been waiting to share this news until we were sure of her condition, and we’re cautiously optimistic now. Thank you so much to everyone for your help, prayers, and support during this tough time – it truly meant the world to us. Please keep Mindy in your thoughts for a full recovery so she can finally put this behind her and feel safe again.

As for the suspect, the police are expected to charge him soon and are waiting on Columbus Humane to move forward, although it’s been a slow process.

Thank you all again, and please continue to keep Mindy in your prayers. We hope she’s on the path to healing and safe from harm from now on.

I shared her latest picture and one of her picture at the vet with her bad diarrhea :(

Should I double minor?,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1gdf38k/should_i_double_minor/,0,13,2024-10-27 16:37:30,"I am a sophomore, but I am a junior by credits. I am trying to decide between two minors, or should I get both? The two minors are CIS and Media Production Analysis. I don't think CIS will be too hard for me because I am currently in Math 3345, which I find really easy and Foundations 1 is basically Math 3345 in a trench coat. I also took intro R coding (STAT 5730) and Python  (CSE 1224). I feel like CIS will be pretty doable for me because I am also taking Math 2255 differential equations at the moment and I find that course easy too. As you know, I love math. I want to explore all aspects of math. As for Media Production, I am interested in the classes, but only one class (Theatre 3351) is really worth taking for me. 

  
Here is the thing. If you were to tell me that I could only pick one minor, I would pick CIS. I don't want to overload my schedule because I feel that maintaining at least 3.3 (better yet 3.5) is important too. But Media production analysis minor also interests me. I don't know if I should do the double minor.

  
TLDR: two minors interest me

I am a high school senior currently applying for OSU! I retook my ACT and got a super score of 27 (26 on both takes….) and was wondering if this is a decent enough score to submit? I think I should also note that I did do writing on the ACT and got a 7 because I didn’t finish the essay…. So will they also be looking at this?

All of my grades are good so far and I have a 4 GPA, it’s just I am not so great at timed tests. Of the people I’ve asked (both at OSU and at my high school) I’ve got almost a half yes half no. The people at my high school said it was a good enough score and it wouldn’t hurt. While the people at OSU said a 28 or higher would be better and if I’m applying for a scholarship I should only submit if it’s 30+…. 

So, I wanted to get a few more thoughts! Do you think that a 27 is a good enough score especially if I’m applying to scholarships like the Morrill Scholarship and Honors Program?

Option one: Wait till 9am (it’s 11pm now) to call buckeyelink to ask if I will receive disbursement if I pay out of pocket now (which will cause me to go negative in bank account), but may lose my spot in a class that has 7 seats left.

Option two: Pay now, go negative, and register for spring, hoping and praying I get disbursed back without actually knowing for sure and be negative until whenever.

Also if I didn’t use my offer for summer could I move it to autumn and get disbursed more? Help!! Thank you!!"

“😩 uuuuggghh… I love mayonnaise sooo much”

I froze, the words lingering in the air like a strange echo. Slowly, I turned, my gaze catching a glimpse of his plate—a burger. Drenched. Almost suffocating under an obscene amount of mayonnaise. It dripped with excess, glistening under the fluorescent lights.

Surely, I thought, this was some joke, a punchline to be shared with his friend next to him. But when I glanced around, there was no one. Only him. And me."

—

TL;DR We have taken down the Ticketbay app. It will be back before the next game.

We’ve received reports and detected suspicious activity around our app that suggest a scam ring infiltrated our service. The only way this was achieved was through one of three possibilities:

- hacked OSU emails
- Buckeyes acting maliciously
- Buckeyes inadvertently sharing their login codes with scammers

While we’re taking some immediate measures to tighten security, there’s honestly not much that can be done in these sorts of situations. We can mitigate as best we can, but these attack vectors are ultimately under the umbrella of social engineering. There’s only so much that the Salty Software team can *proactively* do to save our users from themselves.

We have taken action on suspicious accounts and are implementing enhanced monitoring tools so that we’re better able to detect this kind of nefarious activity. 

We apologize to those of you that were impacted by these scams. We only ask that you understand that Ticketbay cannot be held responsible, as the Platform itself does not perform any sort of monetary exchange on the behalf of the user.

Continue to keep us posted! We’ll let you all know once the app is back online."

The last time I saw this asked, it was three years ago. 

Essentially, to qualify for a CPA license in Ohio, you need 30 academic credits in accounting classes (24 for to sit.)

I wanted to double check that the 6 credit hours from Marc’s intro accounting courses qualify under this standard (24 in accounting specialization + 6 for the intro = 30). If not, obviously other things will be necessary, so please let me know your experiences!

It definitely feels intentional by OSU to have exactly 30 when combined, but I have heard conflicting information.

Missing exam because of bad ear infection.,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1g8jbaw/missing_exam_because_of_bad_ear_infection/,5,3,2024-10-21 06:30:48,"Hello everyone, 

I have an exam this Thursday and review section this morning for that exam. I unfortunately got a bad ear infection and have been suffering all day in pain with a fever and nausea as well. I haven't been able to sleep and am going to urgent care first thing in the morning. The issue is, from my experience these ear infections can take days to over a week to clear up. My class policy is ""
"" No make-up exams will be given except for an
excused absence. In the event of absence due to illness/family emergency/OSU-related
activities, please inform me at once and be prepared to provide written documentation to verify
your absence. The lowest midterm exam grade will be dropped at the end of the semester"". Would going to urgent care and having documentation of me being sick be enough? I emailed my instructor giving her a heads up. Stating that I'm aiming to take the exam normally, however; if I don't feel better in the next couple of days I worry about my ability to perform fairly on it. I've never missed an exam due to illness so I'm stressing out. It would be dangerous for me to drive with a fever to the morning review section this morning too. Which puts me at a further disadvantage. Man... my luck sucks."
Free Dog Meat 😬,https://i.redd.it/6r8rj85d96wd1.jpeg,0,9,2024-10-21 20:48:12,"I had powerful conversations at this table about the ethics of eating animals. It’s absurd how we do everything to protect animals like dogs, yet turn a blind eye to the blatant exploitation of cows, chickens, and others. Why do we draw this arbitrary line and ignore the pain of other animals?

College is the perfect place to question our beliefs and examine our conditioning. I grew up eating a lot of meat too. I loved animals, yet I was conditioned to accept their exploitation as normal. It became routine, not a conscious choice.

The turning point for me was when I was rescuing animals, and a friend bluntly said, “You’re literally paying for animals to be killed.” It hit me hard—I had been contributing to the very thing I claimed to oppose.

In the U.S., dogs are companions, but cows are food. Yet morally, what's the difference? They all feel pain, fear, and joy. The problem isn't in the differences—it’s in why we choose to exploit some while protecting others.

This realization led me to veganism, not as a diet, but as a moral stance against animal exploitation. Veganism rejects the idea that animals are ours to use. It’s not about reducing suffering—it’s about dismantling a system of oppression that treats sentient beings as commodities.

The moral urgency is clear: every meal is a choice to perpetuate or reject exploitation. We owe it to ourselves, the planet, and the animals to act now.

I loved the openness of the students here at Ohio State University. Together, we can shift toward a world where justice, not convenience, guides our choices.

Let’s keep pushing for a world where compassion, ethics, and logic replace exploitation. We'll be at the table tomorrow as well. Come chat with us :) ✌💪

I’m reaching out because I’ve been facing some difficulties related to residency. I wanted to share some information that I learned: if you are a transfer student or from out of state, your chances of receiving a scholarship are quite low. Therefore, I recommend considering private universities, as they often provide more aid.

I know there are many good universities in the U.S., but since I can’t go outside Columbus, I applied to Ohio Dominican University. They informed me that $18,000 of my tuition will be covered due to my membership in the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society. Additionally, I found out that I could graduate early, in about 1.5 years.

What are your thoughts? If you were in my position, what would you do? 

Please be kind; I'm just seeking advice and am currently in the process of searching for options. Thank you!"

Advice on CIS Minor Elective Course Selection: CSE3241 vs. CSE5052,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1g7k7a6/advice_on_cis_minor_elective_course_selection/,1,1,2024-10-19 22:19:07,"Hi guys,

I’m a senior minoring in CIS, and I’m currently deciding on an elective course. I’m torn between CSE3241 and CSE5052, and I would really appreciate your advice.

I’ve heard CSE3241 focuses on SQL, and since I have some experience with SQL from a summer internship where I worked on data analysis, this course seems relevant to my interests. My graduate school applications are also geared toward data analysis and data science, so 3241 could be valuable for that. However, I’ve also heard from a friend who took it last semester that it’s not an easy course.

On the other hand, CSE5052 seems to have fewer prerequisites and might be easier. I have a friend planning to take it next semester, and we could form a study group, which might make the coursework more manageable and easier.

Given that I’m applying for graduate school and want to maintain a strong GPA, which course would you recommend? Has anyone taken either of these, and what was your experience?"

Long story short. I took BUSFIN 3400 and Econ 4002 before they did the Curriculum change. As Econ 4002 was a part of my Econ minor. I applied to graduation for Spring 2025 and they emailed me this letter, telling me I have to take an additional 3 credit hours to satisfy my graduation requirements. 

I think this is absolutely BS since I was under the impression that since I enrolled in Autumn of 2021 i should follow that Curriculum. And they decided to hit me with the extra class last minute. I am working with my advisor to gain an exception for this rule, but I just think OSU is getting more and more greedy every single year. When I came here they issued us Ipads and now the new incoming freshmen don't get shit, they also decided to take away my creative cloud licensing. "

Mind you, all of my assignments have been graded. I don’t have any assignments that haven’t been graded or anything and I always use a AI checker just in case my writing may sound AI(cause for some reason sometimes it does idk why) but I do NOT use AI on my work.  I’m assuming AI is why she reported me btw because I know for a fact I did not plagiarize. I won’t lie I do sometimes use Grammarly to help fix the punctuation(periods,commas things like that) but that’s it i don’t use it to reframe my writing. The only other suspicion that I have besides these little writing assignments is with the quizzes I do finish them fairly quick but that’s because their not really hard. Going back to my writing if it’s cause of that maybe it’s the style of how I write that she reported me which is weird though because why would she wait all the way till now when we’re already halfway through the semester so maybe it’s just a recent assignment raising flags. I’m so lost, and just trying to figure out what it may be so I’m sorry for my rambling. I contacted student advocacy and they told me that I probably won’t hear anything until next semester and this is freaking me out even more. Also, I have no proof either to prove my innocence cause I do all my work on canvas. I’m also terrified to even do future assignments for this class because I don’t know what I did wrong. I’ll just have to record myself doing everything ig.

Hey everyone!

I’m a graduating dental student at OSU, and I’m currently accepting new patients who need dental work. I’m offering a range of services at a reduced cost compared to normal dental offices including:

	•	Fillings
	•	Crowns
	•	Dentures & Partials
	•	Extractions
	•	Cleanings and Periodontal (Gum Disease) Treatment

All procedures are supervised by experienced faculty, and it’s a great way to get high-quality care at a fraction of the cost you’d pay elsewhere.

If you’re interested or have any questions, feel free to message me! I’d be happy to help get you scheduled for an exam appointment! Thanks! :)"

I promised myself to finish the semester at least to get the credits, but I am still suffering.

I understand just skipping all my classes and work will completely ruin my GPA and all the credits I was working towards, but theoretically if I move out all my stuff from the dorm and just stop showing up to class, will they take that as me dropping out? 

Can they do anything about it? Or will I just end the semester with all Fs and I will not be charged? 

I wanted to leave as soon as possible but I genuinely cannot afford the rest of my tuition, since they would take away my grants. I’d honestly rather fail all my classes than immediately go into debt, so I’m just wondering if that could be an option, or would they catch on and I get in trouble?

Almost-Alumni?,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1g437q7/almostalumni/,30,4,2024-10-15 08:50:59,"Hey y'all, just taking a shot in the dark to see if I might find some comradery while I'm sitting here full of wishes long-past.

I'm not sure if anyone is in quite the same boat here, but I was a fourth-year student in the dread-year 2020, by all means planning on being done with my degree and moving on to bigger and brighter things. COVID hit right in the midst of what should have been a grand finale, and well, everything fell apart.

I'm sure the pandemic touched each of us in it's own awful way, but in short, I had to move house, start working full-time,  and of course, right when I needed it to work the most, my computer broke down. There was no way I was going to be able to feasibly finish all of my classes online, and deal with the other situations that arose due to the pandemic.

So, I withdrew, thinking everything would go back to normal (in person) soon and I could just go back and finish whenever I was ready. Best laid plans and all that. Well, four years have gone by, I've got a family I'm supporting almost all on my own, and I'm working a not-quite dead-end job. I'm proud of myself for pushing through all of it and doing what I had to do, but Im also filled with regret for not just finishing the damn thing. I'd more than earned it by the time I stopped.

I wish I could say things have calmed down enough that I have the ability to go back and throw myself in to finishing that degree, but I don't think that's in the cards unfortunately, for at least a while. Still, though, I'm going to take a look at my transcripts when I can and try to see what I can do.

Want opinions on the school of Engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1g3u90y/want_opinions_on_the_school_of_engineering/,2,4,2024-10-14 23:44:07,"Hi. I am a high school senior about to submit my applications to all my universities. One thing that I have been dwelling over for a very long time is whether or not engineering is something I should try (specifically aerospace or biomedical... I know... very different) I have a very big passion for both subjects related to these two forms of engineering and would love to create, design, and test devices related to them. However, I am just so genuinely worried that I will not do well enough in them. I've taken 16 APs, and the two that I have struggled most in were Calc BC and Chemistry. Both of which I know are very important subjects in engineering fields. So I am wondering if maybe anyone had similar experiences to me. I am concerned that my struggle at such a base level will affect me badly when I try to work my way up to bigger levels. Aside from this, though, I have a very big passion for physics and have always enjoyed and done relatively well in my classes, but I am worried that the workload as an engineering major will be too much for me regardless of whether or not this is something I strive for. So I guess what I am asking is for people's honest experiences as engineering majors at OSU. Sorry for the ramble.. lol."

I have high GPA BUT I can’t apply bc :
	•	I have a high GPA and completed my General Education (GE) requirements at Columbus State Community College (CSCC) but did not earn an associate degree.(transfer )

	•	I am out of state and cannot return to my home country due to the ongoing war there. I have a U.S. passport, but I didn’t grow up here, so I don’t have a “home” state to return to.(out of state )

    .    When I was at CSCC I got to PTK honor society.

I’m considering Franklin University, but I’m not sure if it’s the best fit for me I don’t love online degree.
Does anyone have experience with Franklin University or recommendations for other affordable, transfer-friendly schools with strong programs? I’m currently a Computer Science major, but I’m also interested in fields that integrate tech and health/genetics, maybe as a minor

As r/OSU continues to grow, the mod team needs additional help. Over the last ~~year~~ few months, the community has grown much faster than expected, and the amount of posts and comments has gone up as a result.

**What are we looking for?**

We're looking for someone who:

1. Has a **history of** ***positive*** **and** ***helpful*** **interactions in** r/OSU
2. Has a ***strong connection to Ohio State***
3. Is ***regularly active*** **on reddit**

*Bonus points if you are actively involved at OSU, have moderation experience, and/or if you plan on sticking around at OSU/Columbus for a while (e.g. you're a student who has >1 year to go in their degree).* (this is not required)

**What do moderators do? What is it like to moderate** r/OSU**?**

Moderators primarily approve/remove content in r/OSU, but there are opportunities to contribute in other ways (e.g. community engagement, subreddit styling, automation, etc). While we're primarily looking for assistance with approving/removing content, we're open to anyone who thinks they can positively contribute.

This subreddit is typically pretty calm but there are occasional bursts of activity that may need more attention (e.g. on bad weather days, during *a certain* graduation speech, or anytime anything big happens on campus). As with any online, anonymous gig there will also be occasional trolling and outright harassment from users. It can sometimes be stressful, so we wanted to provide a heads up. If you have any questions about being a moderator, please [send a message to ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/OSU).

**How can I apply?**

If you think this sounds interesting, please [send a message to ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/OSU) with a brief message (i.e. no more than a paragraph) explaining why you want to be a moderator and what you would bring to the table.

Please don't post applications in the comments, they won't be considered.

**What if I'm not interested?**

If this doesn't sound interesting to you, note that individual users have a lot more power than they think! Continue to use upvotes/downvotes to determine what does/does not belong on this sub, and continue to use the report button for when rules are broken. And a sincere thanks to everyone who already does that, it makes moderating so much easier and our community that much better.

Decisions will be reached within the next few weeks, and new moderators will be reached out to directly. Applications may be closed earlier if we find what we're looking for, though. If you have any questions, or wish to apply, please use [this link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/OSU) to modmail the moderators. Please don't put applications in the comments, or reach out to individual moderators via PM (the link provided goes to a shared inbox).

Thanks for being a great community, we appreciate you all <3"

Long Rant about unfair life/scholarship opportunities ,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1fyw3xm/long_rant_about_unfair_lifescholarship/,0,12,2024-10-08 09:58:27,"I graduated from high school in 2022 and  attended Rutgers University for a semester and a half. Unfortunately, my experience there wasn't ideal and was caused by a combination of bad circumstances. During my senior year of high school, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer, which was a significant challenge. The affected testicle was removed, and cancer technically cured completely, but it required frequent follow-ups with an oncologist every three months for the first two years. Due to my health concerns, my parents insisted I stay close to home and attend Rutgers which I didn't even consider as an option initally since I have gotten into Purdue(Direct admission for computer science) early action and committed and later gotten an offer from Georgia Tech(Exploratory) and University of Washington Seattle(Data and Information Sciences) later UCLA(Data Theory&Sciences) as well but was forced to change my commitment to Rutgers (state school of new jersey) last minute and to add insult to injury Rutgers didn't even consider me for the Honors program since I did not apply early action. I feel like everything I worked for in high school was undone and coming into Rutgers I was very discouraged and had no motivation.

Before all this, I had a strong academic and extracurricular background in high school. I ranked 19th out of 488 students in my grade, co-founded the coding club, and was on the swim team for 3 years and played football freshmen year. My SAT score was 1520 super-score, and I had a weighted GPA of 4.64 taking after 10 AP classes performing very well, AP CSA : 4, APUSH : 5, AP Euro :5, AP Micro: 4, AP Macro: 5, AP Stats: 4, AP Calc AB: 3, AP Physics 1: 4, AP Physics 2: 3 and AP Physics C: 4.


At Rutgers I had to deal with a series of unfortunate events, particularly with one of my suitemate and his roommate who were are very selfish and manipulative. The suite setup was a recipe for disaster: three doubles with no AC and only one bathroom. One of them is a weird bisexual guy that take over 1 hour in the bathroom and we have to walk to the student center to use it while he was in there as there was no communal bathroom in the suites in the building. He is very sensitive and often cries over stuff and acts somewhat feminine. My suite-mates also very selfish and constantly disrespected me and my belongings. He was caught touching himself in the bathroom when he forgot to lock the door, he yelled at me but I had a emergency and needed to piss, and seeing him doing that only agitated me even more. I kicked him in the legs while he was on the toilet  (there was one toilet for six of us to share and there isn't a communal bathroom in the building).  The situation escalated after his and him roommate took my car keys without permission after I left it on the table and used my car. They kept on insisting that I gave them permission even though I know I never said that and already being in a poor mental health state and out of frustration, I confronted them and out of anger I made a serious threat. This led to them reporting me to the university, and I was forced to withdraw to avoid expulsion. Additionally, the parents of bisexual student filed a police report against me, resulting in a misdemeanor on my record.  (Taken directly from the police report: ""Specific allegations include verbal and physical threats to their mental and physical well-being, and discriminatory behavior based on their sexual orientation."") I was already in a poor mental state from the health complications when coming into Rutgers and was seeking therapy.

This incident strained my relationship with my parents even more whom I already was kinda resentful of for making me give up college offers I worked so hard to earn. They were already burdened with my oncology copays, and they weren't too happy about covering my legal fees. They have since stopped supporting me financially. 

I had to see a psychologist before I could return to school and I wasn't able to attend any university until I was cleared that I won't be a threat to others. I also was no longer able to go to any New Jersey public universities and had a court restraining order that I cant be near any Rutgers campuses or its surrounding town. 

I choose to transfer to Ohio State University in the fall of 2023, which has a very strong Computer Science and Engineering program. It is also much more recognized by industry than Rutgers CS program (I can confirm that I've been to a career fair at both). It is also one of the institutions that don't give a flying shit about potential new students' past disciplinary records and would literally admit a felon (one of my current housemates is a nontraditional student with past criminal conviction record he is actually very genuine and direct guy and kinda acts like a big brother figure for me on campus) . I think it's a good thing because I don't think criminal records define who someone is. I actually feel like I belong on campus and everyone I met seems so understanding. 

I have been clean since transfering currently maintaining a 3.54 GPA, and secured an internship in Columbus, completed several professional certificates from Google, and become actively involved on campus clubs (AI club) relating to my major. I have been very involved on campus since this spring and am actively participating in the Engineers Council and doing Hack-IO the second time this October. I was just admitted to my major and I really want to finish. I also recently secured a co-op internship in Columbus. 

However, I am stressed financially. All My friends from my new jersey high school, who also attend OSU, received merit scholarships like the National Buckeye and Provost/Maximus awards, significantly reducing their tuition costs. Unfortunately, I can’t be considered for any scholarships from school due to being a transfer student and am now facing the reality of paying almost $40,000 a year out of pocket after housing and grants (I live off campus and it's significantly cheaper). This is just a stupid university policy that transfer students aren't considered for merit based scholarships. I tried the scholarship universe and it didn't work (being asian male in stem definitely didn't help) . I should qualify for at least the national buckeye scholarship $13.5k a year merit based scholarship based on my stats and the financial aid calculator. Every first year out of state student with SAT above 1350 or ACT over 30  and HS GPA above 3.6 has received it. My stats were way above that but I'm ineligible due to bad timing when applying. Most of my New Jersey friends gotten national buckeyes and provosts and paying only 25-30k a year after grants as an out of state resident. I received the full grants but it's not nearly as much as scholarships.

   Ohio State is technically one of the universities that is known to be very generous with merit based scholarships for out of state students. It's a popular school for a lot of New Jersey people because of how affordable it could be after the merit based aid making the cost comparable or even slightly cheaper than the instate tuition at Rutgers.

Ohio State also has much more resources for students and actually cares about their students compared to Rutgers. plus its campus and newer facilities and is definitely a huge upgrade from Rutgers. Student life is phenomenal whether its the campus bars, football games or OUAB events. 

OSU also has a much overall better engineering and business program a lot of my NJ friends came because they are in the business scholars program

I currently live off-campus near Summit street, and while my internship covers my rent and food, I’m relying on federal and private loans to cover the remaining $33,500 in tuition. Without a cosigner, I will accumulate substantial debt, and by the time I graduate, I estimate I will owe close to $100,000. Meanwhile, my high school friends who received scholarships will graduate with substantially less and their parents are already supporting them while I lost support from my family completely.

I feel that life has treated me incredibly unfairly. My parents have essentially disowned me over the incident at Rutgers, which they believe is shamful for the family. As first generation Chinese immigrants we have something called Mian-Zi which means face and what I did caused my parents to lose a lot of face/dignity (hope y’all first gens reading this can relate). They paid for my full tuition while I was at Rutgers which totaled around $24k a year after room and board, but now I’m on my own. Before my diagnosis my dad even agreed to pay my full tuition if I go to Purdue or Georgia Tech. 

Despite this, I really want to finish my degree at OSU and build a strong foundation for the future.  However, the weight of this financial cost is very unfair, especially knowing that my other peers from New Jersey are paying way less after asking all my high school friends at OSU. I was told 75% of out of staters got some sort of scholarship from the university whether its provost, buckeye or morril. My current girlfriend is a Morrill prominence scholar from New York (I had slightly better stats but she had much stronger extracurricular). I often felt very left out when my out of state peers say how cheap OSU is for them compared to their in state institutions.

All my health issues are resolved but I kinda screwed my life over within a few months during my time at Rutgers and managed to land a criminal record. It did teach me a hard lesson about anger management and tolerance. I am on track to graduate in December 2026

"TW!My Cat Was Killed in a Horrific Act of Cruelty, and the Suspect Still Faces No Consequences",https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1fxku6t/twmy_cat_was_killed_in_a_horrific_act_of_cruelty/,1374,337,2024-10-06 16:45:31,"Hi everyone,

I’m writing this post to share a heartbreaking and disturbing experience in the hopes of raising awareness and seeking justice. On the night of September 27th, 2024, my beloved cat was taken from me in an unthinkable act of cruelty by one of my housemates.

According to CCTV footage, the suspect, an OSU civil engineering student, was the only one in the house at the time. He took my cat, placed her in a plastic bag, and tied it shut to suffocate her. He then cut off her collar, which had a tracker, ensuring I couldn’t find her after she was taken. Despite this shocking and deliberate act of cruelty, no action has yet been taken to hold the person accountable.

The most terrifying part is that when I confronted the suspect, he initially lied, claiming he had nothing to do with my cat’s disappearance. After the video surfaced, he lied again, saying he was carrying a Giant Eagle bag, not my cat. When the police arrived to question him, he ran away and hid in a hotel. I can’t help but sense that he’s done something terrible to her, but I still haven’t been able to find her body.

What’s even scarier is that this could happen to anyone. Even with clear evidence, the suspect has faced no immediate consequences, and the Columbus Humane is moving slowly. It’s heartbreaking to think that someone could commit such a horrible act and still evade justice. This man is dangerous, and I believe he must face the consequences for his actions.

I’m devastated, not just by the loss of my beloved pet, but by the lack of urgency to ensure that those who commit acts of animal cruelty are held accountable. My cat wasn’t just a pet—she was a member of my family, and her life was taken in such a cruel and senseless manner.

I’m sharing this in hopes that this story doesn’t go unnoticed and that justice can be served not just for my cat, but to send a message that animal cruelty should never be tolerated.

If anyone wants more details about the suspect, please feel free to DM me.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Details below. Let me know if you have any questions!

-Mike Abito (Director of UG Studies, Dept of Econ)

 ----------

**ECON 4410 Data Management and Econometric Analysis**

Spring 2025 TuTh 12:45pm-2:05pm

Arps Hall 388

Instructor: Eric Gibbons



Ever wanted to learn how to handle and analyze economic datasets with zero or minimal programming experience?

Typically the fixed costs of learning a programming or statistical language can be quite high and most of the stuff you learn may not be directly useful for your data-driven careers. 

ECON 4410 is designed to minimize these fixed costs and allows you to learn the necessary skills to import and clean data, manage empirical projects, and produce high quality tables and visualizations from econometric models.

By the end of the course, students will gain enough proficiency in the Python programming language to be able to apply these skills to your own empirical/data-driven project.

 

*Prerequisites:*

ECON/INTSTD 3400 or STAT 1430 or STAT 1450 or STAT 2450 or AEDECON 2005

Sociology 3487 - Qualitative Research Project Participants ,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/1fxhfg7/sociology_3487_qualitative_research_project/,5,0,2024-10-06 14:14:40,"Hi! 

I’m currently taking Research Methods in Sociology (SOC3487) and am doing a qualitative research project where the research question is:

“What are the challenges faced by women who participate in male-centered gaming culture?” 

What sparked my interest in this particular phenomenon is that I am, (1) a female gamer and (2) have had my fair share of misogynistic, sexist, and uncomfortably sexual encounters with men while online gaming, specifically in co-op games like COD and Apex. My primary goal is to determine just how common this is for other women (or gender-noncomforming people), and how they and their experiences while gaming are impacted by it. 

If anyone with similar experiences would like to participate, I would only need to interview 1-2 people! I would like to preface by saying, though, that ONLY the audio for the interview would have to be recorded and would then be transcribed for the assignment. The audio would only be shared with my professor, and you yourself will never have to be photographed, and we could even use a pseudonym (fake name) if that would make you more comfortable. However, if that’s not something you are comfortable with, I completely understand! I just thought I’d put that out there.

[Also, the interview does NOT have to be conducted in person, over the phone or via Zoom is perfectly fine! And I am willing to work around your schedule!]

If you ARE still willing to participate, please feel free to let me know and I will send the interview guide to you so that you know beforehand what kind of questions I would ask. And, if you would like to pre-prepare your answers that option is there too! If there are any questions that you are uncomfortable answering, I am more than happy to make changes to accommodate you!

"On MC questions, ALWAYS trust your gut",https://v.redd.it/d591y44ksmsd1,34,3,2024-10-04 00:07:44,"
So I’m taking CSE 3461 (Computer Networking). It’s a fun class and I have (or had) 100% in it. The midterm just happened and I was studying for weeks for it (we only get one and it’s 20% of our grade). 

So I took the exam (Online), and managed to finish with a little time left.

“Let me double check my answers from the MC section,” Said the nervous idiot devil sitting on my shoulder.

Before I knew it time was almost up and I had collected 3-4 questions where I felt iffy on them. In a panic, I convinced myself they were wrong and changed all of them at the last minute. Shocker, ALL of them were right on the first guess (Like a 9% swing on my score). So what would’ve been an 94% becomes an 85%.

Always trust your gut on multiple choice, unless you can 100% prove why another one is really the right one."

I went to the health department yesterday to get them done and while talking to the nurse I mentioned they're for OSU, and she said that they might not let me schedule for the spring until they confirm I received them. Which takes a month for them to process and additionally I have to get the second varicella next month

Is this true? I tried calling them with no answer, and my email was replied to with a copy & pasted non-answer. I'm SLDS so I'm supposed to start scheduling in a couple of weeks but now I'm worried because my classes next semester are somewhat competitive and I work full time so I don't have a very flexible schedule

This was a recent change in the law (2023), so this will be the first major election it applies to.  
  
You also WILL NOT be able to use the Ohio Digital ID to vote, you must have a physical ID.  
  
The list of acceptable documents is here (listed below):  
  
[https://www.ohiosos.gov/elections/voters/id-requirements/](https://www.ohiosos.gov/elections/voters/id-requirements/)  
  
If you do not have one of these documents, there are some solutions (from best to worst):  
  
(1) You can still vote absentee! This is probably the easiest way to still vote, but you will need to request your absentee ballot soon. The deadline is 29 October, but it is recommended to request the application by 22 October, to make sure you receive your documents and are able to get them returned by the election date.  
  
(2) You can go to the BMV and apply for an identification card (you will need to bring the appropriate documentation to get this card from the BMV). Identification cards (without driver's licenses) are free, and the temporary card that you obtain is a legal form of ID.  
  
(3) In a worst case scenario, where it is election day and you haven't done (1) or (2). You should still go and vote with a provisional ballot. In order for your ballot to be counted, you will have to bring an appropriate form of ID to the election office within 4 days after the election.  
  
If you have any friend's from out of state who are planning to vote in Ohio, please share this info with them as well!

I feel that it’s so rare to see people smoking compared to other places that I have been to (some europe and east asian countries). Is it just a false statement? I grew up watching american films and I thought smoking cigarettes is somehow related to masculinity and considered as a cool thing.

Edit: Thank you for all the comments and explanations. I did not expect this many replies. Just want to clarify that I am aware that smoking kills. I did not mean “why americans don’t smoke and they should do so”. I’m just genuinely curious why it’s rare to see americans smoke compared to other places. 

I find it interesting that anti-smoking education also exists in other countries, yet it only worked great in united states. Also I couldn’t understand why weeds are so popular among young generation. Aren’t they worse than cigarettes or at least equally bad as cigarettes? (It’s just my understanding)"

I took German while I was overseas and passed two proficiency tests. One of the tests is actually in the syllabus for German 3, and it says passing this test gives you professional A2 level. The Chair of the German department accepted my test and was ready to give me credits, but the Transfer Credit Center didn’t approve them.

Any advice?

German has so much grammar that I’ve forgotten a lot of it!

This class is required for all transfer students, and it is absolutely garbage. The material is outdated, the instructor never responds to feedback, and I finally had enough. This was my reflection of this ""wellness"" requirement, in full rant. And yes, I submitted it to Canvas.

""The resource that I “utilized” for wellness was the Dennis Learning Center. I say I utilized in quotations because, like the rest of the course, the hour I spent advising the person who was supposed to be advising me out of my Sunday could have been better used for my wellness with a walk in the park, a stroll through a farmer’s market, or a good book with a cup of tea. The description of the assignment says that our overall wellness is important to the school and that you know that our academic success depends on more than what happens in the classroom, which is true, but to force us, with the threat of a failing grade, to “connect” to campus doesn't say that our wellness is important, it says that our funding is. 

My reflection on this final assignment is that the entire course could have been an email, a PowerPoint presentation, or a video learning course similar to the anti-hazing requirement. Instead, it is assumed that transfer students who WERE REQUIRED to meet with their advisors in order to schedule their classes for the first semester are too stupid to plan ahead for their future. It is assumed that those same transfer students don’t understand academic integrity, general education requirements, schedule planning, employment and internship planning, or academic standards and standing. It is, in no uncertain terms, insulting to our intelligence. OSU is not an easy school to be accepted to. We worked hard to get where we are, and to have to pay for a class that treats us as if we are incompetent is a slap in the face to that hard work. 

This introduction to Ohio State should have come during the application process, again as a PowerPoint or video, not while we acclimate and integrate into the campus. During this first semester, we should be excited and engaged. We should be holistically integrated through peers and colleagues. We should not be forced to find something we are not passionate about to get a grade. 

Did you know that we can customize our dashboard in Carmen Canvas? This class is labeled a “Waste of Time,” not because I do not have the time to complete the work but because my time could and should be utilized elsewhere for my “wellness.” Do better, Ohio State, do better. ""

Those classes are interesting, don't get me wrong, but there are more interesting subjects within my major that I'd rather take. Additionally, all of your theme classes for your geneds have to be Honors classes if you're in the program. But there are some really interesting classes I'd like to take for those themes (ex. Psych 3900) that don't count as honors classes. 

As for the pros of the program, I really like having an advisor that's not my major advisor since she can give me a bird's eye view of everything. Priority scheduling is very nice, but SLDS granted me that as well, so if I leave the Honors program, I'll still have priority scheduling.

The kicker is, I don’t get off work until 10pm. The professor for this class doesn’t hand out extensions freely, and expects extension requests 3 days in advanced before it is due. Is it worth asking for an extension I likely won’t get? Or should I just submit it late and take the 25% deduction? Would it be possible this is good enough reason to get a makeup exam in chemistry?
