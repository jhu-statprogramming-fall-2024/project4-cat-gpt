"[Megathread] Prospective Students, Applications, and Admissions For November 2024",https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1ggx2to/megathread_prospective_students_applications_and/,11,24,2024-11-01 04:00:50,"Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit.
* We don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence.
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html).
* NYU's admission rate drops every year, so even the anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's applications."
Food should be free for all students. Can we fix this situation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1gwnss5/food_should_be_free_for_all_students_can_we_fix/,68,19,2024-11-21 19:22:13,"Hey, I'm an alum from \~15 years ago. I just got a text message asking me to donate money to pay for NYU students' lunches. UM. You all are running out of lunch? NYU is letting you all down, big time...

I'm not sure how much is actionable, but as active students, you all have powers that alum don't -- can you implore your nearest deans to **make food free or affordable for students**? We can't knock on office doors like you all can. 🙏

In the meantime, **is there anything alumni can do to help**? We can make some calls, emails, work on an OpEd to send somewhere?

Just in case anyone anywhere thinks this is even slightly acceptable, I just want to emphasize that this is outrageously insane, not okay, and potentially really quite fixable:

* NYU's endowment is \~$5.9 billion (as of 2023).
* It owns a ton of real estate.
* Your tuition is $62k/year. Food is $7k/yr for \*commuters\*. Food and housing for dormers is an estimated $22k. That's on top of the $62k.
   * That's not inflation, that's *insanity*. For that price, your food should be free or extremely cheap.
* Deans are getting paid a TON. They may not be as in-tune to these problems, even if they are occasionally being informed about them. Out of sight, out of mind.
* Compared to the cost of food versus how much money NYU has/receives, it should be entirely feasible to make lunches free or low-cost.

Just coming in with good intentions and I'm completely serious that I want to help, and I know other alumni do too. I can't believe how much costs have spiraled, and how quality of life for students has substantially plummeted related to cost of living."

For incoming Freshman; random tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1gurmlp/for_incoming_freshman_random_tips/,94,2,2024-11-19 07:16:06,"Get the app Notability for ipad, completely free (I didn't believe it at first either, my math professor told me about it)

Save all that money from work and presents and coins you found on the street. All of it, put it in a high yield savings account ASAP

You get $50 printing stipend per semester. Use color.

Get a fridge with a separate freezer, ice cream is a necessity.

Don't use scent beads in the laundry room, and if you care a lot about your laundry, don't use tide pods. I recommend tide free and gentle (white one), laundry sanitizer (weird but it's nice esp if you have skin sensitivities), dryer sheets or dryer balls.

ONLY USE 2 TABLESPOONS PER LOAD, DO NOT OVERLOAD WASHING MACHINES.

Paper towels, lots of them.

Tote bags, but don't bring too many, you'll get a lot from nyu and popups.

Meal swipes and dining dollars go slower than you think. Unless if you are on scholarship, get the lowest meal plan, you'll thank me later.

The shuttles can be a pain, and the subway isn't that scary.

Follow the signs, and if you don't see the right sign, turn around and walk the other way.

A watch is nice. I have a fitbit, I like it.

Bring 1-2 pairs of thick socks and fuzzy socks.

Bring 1-2 nicer pairs of shoes (boots, heels, flats, dress shoes etc)

Duct tape, wall putty, multiple pairs of scissors, blue tape.

You'll want a digital camera, because its coooll. 

Go exploring. You get free access to museums and other school libraries.

Trader joes usually has the cheapest food.

2 sets of sheets. Change sheets every 1-2 weeks.

Mug, plastic tupperware, a good set of utensils (spoon, fork, knife, chopsticks, straw) get a decent cooking knife, even if you don't have a kitchen. (I got one at target for like 6 bucks) They give you whole fruits with nothing to cut it with.

Save those condiments. Salt, pepper, sugar, soy sauce, ketchup, you name it.

Crave (burger place) in paulson has amazing fries

Get involved as much as you can. NYU engage website is the best way. Look up things that are happening. Go to everything you can, something will stick.

You deserve it. Don't feel like you shouldn't have made it in, persevere. 

USE THE RESOURCES. Free tutoring, free counseling, free food, free activities.

If an event requires using subway, email and ask for a metrocard, most of the time they will give you one.

Concerts. Go to them. If they are affordable. If they aren't, wait till like 15- 45 minutes before it starts, tickets will be cheap, and you're already so close.

Bring a mini sewing kit. I use mine all the time. 

If you play the guitar, bring yours, or buy one cheap. I regret not bringing mine.

Get dining ware from thrift stores. They have cute bowls and a mug, that's really all you need.

Compress your photo for your ID car slightly like ->picture<- that, they expand it and you'll look a little weird.

My favorite clothing staples are my jean jacket, brown leather jacket, baggy jeans, sweatshirts, and like 4 graphic tees. Have some long sleeves, only 1-2 tanks.

Try to sell clothes you won't wear before going off. I made like $160 over the summer off of Curtsy.

Get a vacuum seal bag for big items like bedding.

Pre fold your clothes, get drawer organizers.

You'll find cool trinkets here, don't bring too many.

Lots of free things, again, take advantage.

You'll get lots of stickers, save them.

Don't bring a lot of jewelry.

Campus cash is useless

Watch the soda intake

Call family

Rate my prof before adding classes to your shopping cart. Make friends with your professors, especially if you are in a small class.

Most of the classes I'm in drop the lowest homework or lab at the end of the semester. If you really need a break, skip it, just make sure you don't miss the next.

9:30am classes are nice.

Don't leave your stuff unattended, especially water bottles, airpods, etc.

Watch your step.

Volunteering is a great way to make friends and get involved in the community. Nyu has good service groups. 

If you can afford not working the first semester, don't.

Apply to the scholarships your major people email you. A lot of the time people don't, and you can definitely win.

Be nice, be friendly. You will see the people you met from welcome week all over. 

NML (name, major, location) don't forget to talk about something else, it will help you remember people.

Good luck"

As the title says, my friend (20F) and I (19M) are looking for a third roommate to room together for the Spring 2025 semester. My friend’s parents are adamant that another girl joins the rooming group, so if you’re female and you’re interested in rent that’s cheaper than NYU housing prices, this would be a great opportunity! You’ll be sharing the master bedroom with the other girl of the group in a 2-bedroom apartment (or you’ll have your own room if we manage to find a 3-bedroom). In any case, you would not need to worry about sharing a room with me (the guy) at all. We are looking to rent apartments in Manhattan, most likely in the Stuytown/East Village/Kips Bay area, and our expected rent per person would be about/below $2,000. My friend and I are both easygoing and approachable, and thus you don’t need to worry about fitting in. 

I apologize for the fact that this post is made so late into the semester — one of the members in our rooming group dropped out last minute due to personal reasons. To accommodate for this, if you paid the NYU housing deposit for Spring 2025 already but is still interested in rooming with us, I’ll pay out your deposit!

Warning to Pre-Meds: Be Cautious of Dan Block – An MCAT Sca&m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1gtkon3/warning_to_premeds_be_cautious_of_dan_block_an/,47,4,2024-11-17 18:54:59,"Hello everyone,

I want to share my experience with Dan Block, a self-proclaimed perfect scoring MCAT tutor who has been scamming students out of thousands of dollars. He runs private MCAT courses twice a year on Zoom, with around 20-30 students per session and charges $2000+. He also offers private tutoring for $200–$300 per 1.5-hour session. He changes the price at the moment too. I took his fall class, and I know others who have taken his summer or fall sessions as well. I strongly advise you to avoid his services, as he is not a legitimate tutor. He tires you out before you can do anything about it--he is EXTREMELY manipulative.

Here’s why:

1. **Ineffective Teaching**: Dan’s teaching style is aggressive and unhelpful. He often goes over material that is far more difficult than what you’ll encounter on the MCAT, leading to unnecessary confusion and intimidation. His practice problems are not reflective of the actual exam, and they don’t help you build the skills needed for success. He spends hours just lecturing and rambling, which feels like a waste of time. His classes do not prepare you for the real MCAT in any meaningful way.
2. **Focus on His Own Profit, Not Your Success**: Dan discourages using proven resources like flashcards and practice questions, particularly from platforms like UWorld and BluePrint, because he isn’t making money from them. He claims that his students are successful only by using his exclusive content (homework and practice problems), but this is misleading. His material is not aligned with the MCAT, and students who use these paid resources tend to perform much better.
3. **Toxic and Competitive Environment**: Dan’s classes create a very uncomfortable and competitive atmosphere. He frequently calls on students who already have a strong grasp of the material (from resources like Kaplan or flashcards such as MilesDown or JackSparrowDeck528), which makes others feel unprepared. If you’re new to the material, you’ll likely feel inadequate in this environment, even though these students are not representative of the class as a whole.
4. **Manipulative Tactics**: Dan brings in students who have already taken the MCAT and scored 520+, but he tries to credit their success entirely to his teaching. In reality, these students likely prepared independently for months before taking his class, and their scores were earned through their own hard work, not his ""instruction.""
5. **Unprofessional and Disrespectful**: Not only is his teaching ineffective, but Dan is also rude and dismissive. His attitude is off-putting, and he’s more focused on making money than actually helping his students. It’s clear that he’s running a scam from the comfort of his home.

BOTTOM line: Save your money. Instead of enrolling in Dan Block’s class, stick to reputable study resources like UWorld, BluePrint, and flashcards. These tools have a proven track record of helping thousands of students succeed on the MCAT. Don’t fall for Dan’s manipulative tactics, especially if you’re a sophomore or junior in a class filled with students who have already studied extensively or even taken the exam. His class is a waste of time and money. He spends hours on concepts that you could master in just a few minutes, while **making inflated claims that he’s seen every MCAT exam** and knows exactly what will appear on yours. Avoid the frustration and focus on proven methods instead. Be careful and do your research before committing to any MCAT prep program. Your future is too important to risk on a scam.

**Ps**: There’s so much more about this class I could share, like how some students are reportedly cheating on quizzes to inflate the class average, and some of Dan's other questionable tactics. As premeds, we all come from different financial backgrounds, and I don’t think anyone should be put under **financial strain** by someone like Dan Block. The whole premed process is already incredibly expensive, and charging over $3000 for a class and tutoring that doesn’t actually help students is just unethical. He clearly doesn’t care about your success — just about taking your money. ---also just found out that there are multiple dan blocks, the one through the private company who went to st.louis is the one i'm not talking about. this one went to Yale and there's a youtube video in a podcast where he's being interviewed.

One of the other things I’ll mention, since you were asking for examples, is that he psychologically trips you up on the CARS section. For example, he refers to advice and passages from the old official guide and makes statements like ""absolutes can be true,"" implying that answers labeled as ""impossible"" or ""never"" could sometimes be correct. This is misleading—those answers are wrong more than 90% of the time. As someone who took the exam and did extremely well on the CARS section, I can tell you that success in CARS comes down to consistent practice. The issue with his advice is that it throws you off, so you start off doing well in CARS, but after following his bad guidance, you end up struggling. This leads you to book more sessions with him, and that's exactly what he wants. He is a terrible tutor.

to answer someone's question: My main point is that if you want to attend, students  need to go into his class with beforehand MCAT knowledge, but even then **he is extremely manipulative during his individual sessions saying things like 80% of students go this right, guilt tripping, etc, and tried to make me buy another package which I declined. For younger students, I felt the need to make this post because I don't want someone else to give tuition for 2+ years and not see any results, giving this tutor thousands of dollars.** The exam is in your hands but we don't want false information or to be extremely discouraged right at the beginning of MCAT journey-some amount of kindness is appreciated as well."

Is it worth it to apply to take them as the visiting student program? Will they matter on my master application or since they don’t really give any credit then they are not gonna do nothing? 
I really want to get into the Master quantitative economics but I know is competitive and my economics and business degree may not be enough without the necessary math classes.
I really don’t understand much of NYU ways of education but is my dream college.

"PhD Human-centered technology, innovation and design program in NYU ",https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1gocsea/phd_humancentered_technology_innovation_and/,3,1,2024-11-10 22:27:06,"
I am considering applying to the Ph.D. program in Human-Centered Technology, Innovation & Design at NYU, but before I submit my application, I would like to gather more information. My research interests focus on optimization, machine learning, and statistics, and I’m curious if these areas align with the program’s research themes.

I have reviewed the program page (https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/human-centered-technology-innovation-design-phd), but I find that the specific research areas are not entirely clear. However, I know of a new faculty member who specializes in Operations Research, and they recommended the program to me.

If anyone is familiar with the program or its current research, could you share your insights on whether my research interests would be a good fit?

Additionally, I interested in understanding the employability of PhD graduates, both in industry and academia."

"Everytime I dorm, I crash out",https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1gnqty6/everytime_i_dorm_i_crash_out/,34,9,2024-11-10 02:48:42,"Context:

\- I had 2 terrible roomates in my freshman year

\- 1 of them was a slob, and would leave moldy food around, she put bare pizza slices in the mini fridge I bought, no plate, nothing, just on the shelf.. and they had hair on them :,)

\- the 2nd one was rich and had a shopping addiction, dozens of shopping bags took up majority of the room, and she would never sleep at night and then sleep all day, making it hard to things without distrubing her 

\-Afterwards I was traumatized so I got accomidations for a single bc I am mentally ill yayyy

  
All 3 of these senarios have lead to extreme emotional stress, not living comfortably combined with the stress of school was the perfect mix for having daily mental breakdowns. 

When I got a single dorm, not only was it expensive, I was not doing well at all. I have bipolar II, so during mania I was extremely reckless and during depressive episodes I could not get up to go to class. I wasn't taking care of myself and things seriously spiraled out of control. I ended up taking a LOA. 

  
I live on long island with my family, which is about 1 1/2hr commute and it is rough. This semester, I decided to take 4 classes on monday and wednesday and an online class on T/Th because it's less taxing than commuting to the city 4 days a week. 

For this upcoming sem, I'm considering dorming again because it'd be nice to have my days more spread out and not have 8 hrs of class + 3hrs of commuting. Now, I should make a point that, I have been much more stable compared to when I was in a single. I got out of a toxic relationship, got the right meds, and have a job, things are stable which is good in theory, however, I don't think I can do another semester of 11 hour days.

Another thing is that I feel like I can't make real friends (this is probaby me just making excuses). With having 4 classes straight, not only am I completely drained, but there is no way in hell I'm spending more time on campus afterward. Which means I can't go to study groups or hang out with people to hopefully spark a real friendship. Like I talk to ppl in my classes, but I feel like I can't have a commited friendsip without having to spend $40 to go hang out with them on a day I don't have school.

I want to try dorming again, but I'm really worried about not only the financial loss, but also my stability. Things are going pretty good and I don't want to A: be hopitalized again and B: delay my graduation even further. It's really tricky because my mental health has a huge impact on this, but also I'm worried that I might just not be built for dorming; idk I feel really alone when I'm dorming which just amplifies everything that I'm already experiencing; ahhh i just don't want to go through somthing really tramatic againnn. I know none of us can predict the furture, however, if anyone has insight, I would love to hear 🥹🥹"

There's been a few Reddit posts from over the years regarding people's experiences at NYU LA but thought I would see if anyone has gone in recent semesters. I got accepted to go for Spring 2025 but am really ambivalent about committing to it...

Any information people have about the program and their experiences would be so greatly appreciated!

However, I learned that none of the classes offered fulfill any of my graduation requirements (Premodern, Early Modern, Critical Race, etc.) so I am on the fence about committing when I could always just pursue an internship here in New York. In doing so, I would most likely have to spend a summer taking classes just to be able to graduate on time since all the courses I would take would be electives. 

Of course, there are a lot more factors to take into consideration but I thought I would just see what the general vibe is out there about the program while also noting that it's quite new. Any advice you can provide is extremely helpful! Thanks so much!!  "

I'm finally returning to NYU this spring, but I am nervous and scared of messing up this coming semester again, although I am now on the right medication and have gained supports and knowledge of myself that have truly helped me improve how I handle myself as well as my academics. **Is anyone else autistic/adhd and/or ocd at NYU? How have you handled adjusting to NYU to making it work for you not just academically but socially and career-building-wise as well? Does anyone know of any groups, tips, ways to cope and deal with the limitations that come with being autistic that are helpful for them?**

Even if not, has anyone else been on **medical leave** for a while? How have you dealt with coming back and making sure you stay for good and are successful? I'm nervous about being a 21 year old sophomore and having no one to relate to or be friends with considering I already struggle with forming close connections as a baseline. My gpa is horrendous because of everything I went through my first years and I'm scared about what to do career/networking wise because of it. I've suffered a lot my first semesters at NYU and I'm terrified of more of the same, but NYU is my dream school and I want nothing more than to graduate here, make the most of my next 2 years, and be successfully independent."

I try to put all my energy into every interaction and make goofy jokes, but it's just hard to try to meet someone on a regular basis after clubs or anything tbh + a lot of friendships made in class end up being somewhat transactional. Even when I take the initiative to start a type of friendship outside of club or class, it only becomes a one-time thing and I don't know how to avoid that, so here I am. Ima just infodump my interests rn

\* games (Hollow Knight, Celeste, Yakuza, Sam and Max, and some kind-of niche stuff)  
\* digital art (I draw random characs I make and sometimes fanart but not too often. Who knows, maybe I'll draw some very very wholesome fanart of ur fav)  
\* music (I love shoegaze rock like Slowdive, indie rock, Bjork, video game music. ALSO I PLAY GUITAR SOMETIMES AS IN BARELY. I collect CDs which makes me ever so cool and totally superior, jkjk)  
\* web design (I'm enjoying my creative coding class a lot rn!)  
\* shows (Hannibal, Moral Orel, Bojack Horseman, Succession)  
\* anime and manga (golden kamuy, berserk, mushishi, gintama, and one piece r solid)  
\* movies (I USED TO BE SUCH A HUGE MOVIE BUFF KIND OF PLEASE, but my favorites are probably Lost in Translation and The One)  
\* comics (the question, stuff by Brian Vaughan like Paper Girls, plz give me recommendations)  
\* a bunch of other things I'm probably forgetting

My friend recommended I get sound proofing curtains and use a renter friendly suspension rod to keep it up, but that would block the AC unit on that balcony/window so idk how safe that is. I tried sleeping with ear plugs (the foam ones) and they’re really not comfortable to sleep in. 

Any tips on minimizing noise would be really appreciated!!! 

Unrelated theory: I think this room was originally build to be the living room/common area lol because two bathrooms and 4 closets for 5 people doesn’t make sense.

so if you got offered a double in palladium today via room change + female, pls reach out! can confirm room number in dms :-) hopefully this reaches that person!!!"

If you have friends studying CS at UIUC or UPenn you might've heard of it, it's considered a pretty big deal at some schools. There used to be an NYU chapter but I think it became defunct in 2021.

Why Hack4Impact? Well, as we all know, hiring for internships has gotten increasingly competitive, so if anyone else is looking to get some hands-on semi-professional experience while making an impact, this could be a good opportunity.

From what I understand, the application process to become a chapter can take months, and includes a chapter interview with the national board, so if anyone else is interested, let me know and if there's enough interest, we could get started on that process."

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and would appreciate your thoughts.

I tried to talk with them but they are not understanding it and said that the decision is final. I would like to know what can i do further and how or should i move on. Thank you for the advise in advance. 

Note: My Department policy is that you won’t be able to apply again if you have W grade and NYU policy does not say anything regarding the same that W grade can’t be eligible for CPT again."

I recently received an admit for the MS in Computer Engineering (CE) program at NYU Tandon! 🎉 I'm excited about the opportunity but have a few questions about career prospects.

I know the program includes a lot of hardware-focused courses, but I also see electives available in areas like Machine Learning. My goal is to work either as a Software Development Engineer (SDE), Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Engineer after graduation. 

For current students or alumni of the CEE program (or similar programs at NYU Tandon), would you mind sharing your experiences?

- Were you able to tailor your coursework to focus more on software, ML, or data-related topics?

- Did you find it challenging to land roles in these fields given the hardware-heavy curriculum?

- Any advice for balancing the hardware/software courses to build a strong profile for SDE, ML, or Data Engineer roles?

I appreciate any insights you can share! Thanks in advance."

Professor Freestyles the lo Midterm Date (and the whole semester),https://i.redd.it/tkxltx2ifyud1.jpeg,46,18,2024-10-15 17:24:10,"I was hesitant to discuss a professor while class is still in session, but I don’t care anymore.

ECE related students, please take Prof. Das at your discretion.

I’m sure he is an intelligent person and engineer, but his class are just an absolute mess for me, and for most the students I’ve talked to.

There are ZERO lecture slides, ZERO additional materials, and there are ZERO TA office hours.

But there ARE pop quizzes, which was not told to us anywhere on the syllabus. He swears that it will be the same as the homework - but it’s not, he makes up the question on the spot. It’s not difficult, but it’s not the same. I speculate he does this to force attendance.

He tells us to email the TA about assignments and labs, but so far he hasn’t responded to the emails I’ve sent him.  

There is no lecture organization, no planned material for each week of the semester, only estimated lectured hours for each chapter. 

As stated before he has no lecture PDFs, so he freestyles on the white board. He teaches by hand-drawing circuits, which is - as you might expect - perfectly unreadable. It is extremely difficult to absorb the important material since he loves going on tangents and never specifies what will or will not be on exams. 

Seen above, our midterm date is set “tentatively”. The only reason why it wouldn’t be a set date is because it’s different for every semester he teaches. In other words, he can’t teach consistently.

We’ve already spent twice the estimated hours for Chapter 1. I am not convinced that our midterm can be taken at a reasonable date without rushing/skipping over material."

i think the best course of action would be submitting a room change request for a single - im just wondering if anyone has any insight/experiences with room change requests? **is it even likely that it'll get approved since im asking for a type of room that is already high in demand?** if i don't get a single is it possible that they'll make me move out of my current dorm into a double in unit somewhere else (even if the only preference i put down is for singles)? any advice would be greatly appreciated.

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can’t see everything you submit.
* We don’t actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence.
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html).
* NYU's admission rate drops every year, so even the anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's applications."
