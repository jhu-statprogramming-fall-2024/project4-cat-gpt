"[Megathread] Prospective Students, Applications, and Admissions For November 2024",https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1ggx2to/megathread_prospective_students_applications_and/,11,24,2024-11-01 04:00:50,"Dear prospective students,

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can‚Äôt see everything you submit.
* We don‚Äôt actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence.
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html).
* NYU's admission rate drops every year, so even the anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's applications."
Food should be free for all students. Can we fix this situation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1gwnss5/food_should_be_free_for_all_students_can_we_fix/,68,19,2024-11-21 19:22:13,"Hey, I'm an alum from \~15 years ago. I just got a text message asking me to donate money to pay for NYU students' lunches. UM. You all are running out of lunch? NYU is letting you all down, big time...

I'm not sure how much is actionable, but as active students, you all have powers that alum don't -- can you implore your nearest deans to **make food free or affordable for students**? We can't knock on office doors like you all can. üôè

In the meantime, **is there anything alumni can do to help**? We can make some calls, emails, work on an OpEd to send somewhere?

Just in case anyone anywhere thinks this is even slightly acceptable, I just want to emphasize that this is outrageously insane, not okay, and potentially really quite fixable:

* NYU's endowment is \~$5.9 billion (as of 2023).
* It owns a ton of real estate.
* Your tuition is $62k/year. Food is $7k/yr for \*commuters\*. Food and housing for dormers is an estimated $22k. That's on top of the $62k.
   * That's not inflation, that's *insanity*. For that price, your food should be free or extremely cheap.
* Deans are getting paid a TON. They may not be as in-tune to these problems, even if they are occasionally being informed about them. Out of sight, out of mind.
* Compared to the cost of food versus how much money NYU has/receives, it should be entirely feasible to make lunches free or low-cost.

Just coming in with good intentions and I'm completely serious that I want to help, and I know other alumni do too. I can't believe how much costs have spiraled, and how quality of life for students has substantially plummeted related to cost of living."

For incoming Freshman; random tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1gurmlp/for_incoming_freshman_random_tips/,94,2,2024-11-19 07:16:06,"Get the app Notability for ipad, completely free (I didn't believe it at first either, my math professor told me about it)

Save all that money from work and presents and coins you found on the street. All of it, put it in a high yield savings account ASAP

You get $50 printing stipend per semester. Use color.

Get a fridge with a separate freezer, ice cream is a necessity.

Don't use scent beads in the laundry room, and if you care a lot about your laundry, don't use tide pods. I recommend tide free and gentle (white one), laundry sanitizer (weird but it's nice esp if you have skin sensitivities), dryer sheets or dryer balls.

ONLY USE 2 TABLESPOONS PER LOAD, DO NOT OVERLOAD WASHING MACHINES.

Paper towels, lots of them.

Tote bags, but don't bring too many, you'll get a lot from nyu and popups.

Meal swipes and dining dollars go slower than you think. Unless if you are on scholarship, get the lowest meal plan, you'll thank me later.

The shuttles can be a pain, and the subway isn't that scary.

Follow the signs, and if you don't see the right sign, turn around and walk the other way.

A watch is nice. I have a fitbit, I like it.

Bring 1-2 pairs of thick socks and fuzzy socks.

Bring 1-2 nicer pairs of shoes (boots, heels, flats, dress shoes etc)

Duct tape, wall putty, multiple pairs of scissors, blue tape.

You'll want a digital camera, because its coooll. 

Go exploring. You get free access to museums and other school libraries.

Trader joes usually has the cheapest food.

2 sets of sheets. Change sheets every 1-2 weeks.

Mug, plastic tupperware, a good set of utensils (spoon, fork, knife, chopsticks, straw) get a decent cooking knife, even if you don't have a kitchen. (I got one at target for like 6 bucks) They give you whole fruits with nothing to cut it with.

Save those condiments. Salt, pepper, sugar, soy sauce, ketchup, you name it.

Crave (burger place) in paulson has amazing fries

Get involved as much as you can. NYU engage website is the best way. Look up things that are happening. Go to everything you can, something will stick.

You deserve it. Don't feel like you shouldn't have made it in, persevere. 

USE THE RESOURCES. Free tutoring, free counseling, free food, free activities.

If an event requires using subway, email and ask for a metrocard, most of the time they will give you one.

Concerts. Go to them. If they are affordable. If they aren't, wait till like 15- 45 minutes before it starts, tickets will be cheap, and you're already so close.

Bring a mini sewing kit. I use mine all the time. 

If you play the guitar, bring yours, or buy one cheap. I regret not bringing mine.

Get dining ware from thrift stores. They have cute bowls and a mug, that's really all you need.

Compress your photo for your ID car slightly like ->picture<- that, they expand it and you'll look a little weird.

My favorite clothing staples are my jean jacket, brown leather jacket, baggy jeans, sweatshirts, and like 4 graphic tees. Have some long sleeves, only 1-2 tanks.

Try to sell clothes you won't wear before going off. I made like $160 over the summer off of Curtsy.

Get a vacuum seal bag for big items like bedding.

Pre fold your clothes, get drawer organizers.

You'll find cool trinkets here, don't bring too many.

Lots of free things, again, take advantage.

You'll get lots of stickers, save them.

Don't bring a lot of jewelry.

Campus cash is useless

Watch the soda intake

Call family

Rate my prof before adding classes to your shopping cart. Make friends with your professors, especially if you are in a small class.

Most of the classes I'm in drop the lowest homework or lab at the end of the semester. If you really need a break, skip it, just make sure you don't miss the next.

9:30am classes are nice.

Don't leave your stuff unattended, especially water bottles, airpods, etc.

Watch your step.

Volunteering is a great way to make friends and get involved in the community. Nyu has good service groups. 

If you can afford not working the first semester, don't.

Apply to the scholarships your major people email you. A lot of the time people don't, and you can definitely win.

Be nice, be friendly. You will see the people you met from welcome week all over. 

NML (name, major, location) don't forget to talk about something else, it will help you remember people.

Good luck"

Warning to Pre-Meds: Be Cautious of Dan Block ‚Äì An MCAT Sca&m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1gtkon3/warning_to_premeds_be_cautious_of_dan_block_an/,47,4,2024-11-17 18:54:59,"Hello everyone,

I want to share my experience with Dan Block, a self-proclaimed perfect scoring MCAT tutor who has been scamming students out of thousands of dollars. He runs private MCAT courses twice a year on Zoom, with around 20-30 students per session and charges $2000+. He also offers private tutoring for $200‚Äì$300 per 1.5-hour session. He changes the price at the moment too. I took his fall class, and I know others who have taken his summer or fall sessions as well. I strongly advise you to avoid his services, as he is not a legitimate tutor. He tires you out before you can do anything about it--he is EXTREMELY manipulative.

Here‚Äôs why:

1. **Ineffective Teaching**: Dan‚Äôs teaching style is aggressive and unhelpful. He often goes over material that is far more difficult than what you‚Äôll encounter on the MCAT, leading to unnecessary confusion and intimidation. His practice problems are not reflective of the actual exam, and they don‚Äôt help you build the skills needed for success. He spends hours just lecturing and rambling, which feels like a waste of time. His classes do not prepare you for the real MCAT in any meaningful way.
2. **Focus on His Own Profit, Not Your Success**: Dan discourages using proven resources like flashcards and practice questions, particularly from platforms like UWorld and BluePrint, because he isn‚Äôt making money from them. He claims that his students are successful only by using his exclusive content (homework and practice problems), but this is misleading. His material is not aligned with the MCAT, and students who use these paid resources tend to perform much better.
3. **Toxic and Competitive Environment**: Dan‚Äôs classes create a very uncomfortable and competitive atmosphere. He frequently calls on students who already have a strong grasp of the material (from resources like Kaplan or flashcards such as MilesDown or JackSparrowDeck528), which makes others feel unprepared. If you‚Äôre new to the material, you‚Äôll likely feel inadequate in this environment, even though these students are not representative of the class as a whole.
4. **Manipulative Tactics**: Dan brings in students who have already taken the MCAT and scored 520+, but he tries to credit their success entirely to his teaching. In reality, these students likely prepared independently for months before taking his class, and their scores were earned through their own hard work, not his ""instruction.""
5. **Unprofessional and Disrespectful**: Not only is his teaching ineffective, but Dan is also rude and dismissive. His attitude is off-putting, and he‚Äôs more focused on making money than actually helping his students. It‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs running a scam from the comfort of his home.

BOTTOM line: Save your money. Instead of enrolling in Dan Block‚Äôs class, stick to reputable study resources like UWorld, BluePrint, and flashcards. These tools have a proven track record of helping thousands of students succeed on the MCAT. Don‚Äôt fall for Dan‚Äôs manipulative tactics, especially if you‚Äôre a sophomore or junior in a class filled with students who have already studied extensively or even taken the exam. His class is a waste of time and money. He spends hours on concepts that you could master in just a few minutes, while¬†**making inflated claims that he‚Äôs seen every MCAT exam**¬†and knows exactly what will appear on yours. Avoid the frustration and focus on proven methods instead. Be careful and do your research before committing to any MCAT prep program. Your future is too important to risk on a scam.

**Ps**: There‚Äôs so much more about this class I could share, like how some students are reportedly cheating on quizzes to inflate the class average, and some of Dan's other questionable tactics. As premeds, we all come from different financial backgrounds, and I don‚Äôt think anyone should be put under **financial strain** by someone like Dan Block. The whole premed process is already incredibly expensive, and charging over $3000 for a class and tutoring that doesn‚Äôt actually help students is just unethical. He clearly doesn‚Äôt care about your success ‚Äî just about taking your money. ---also just found out that there are multiple dan blocks, the one through the private company who went to st.louis is the one i'm not talking about. this one went to Yale and there's a youtube video in a podcast where he's being interviewed.

One of the other things I‚Äôll mention, since you were asking for examples, is that he psychologically trips you up on the CARS section. For example, he refers to advice and passages from the old official guide and makes statements like ""absolutes can be true,"" implying that answers labeled as ""impossible"" or ""never"" could sometimes be correct. This is misleading‚Äîthose answers are wrong more than 90% of the time. As someone who took the exam and did extremely well on the CARS section, I can tell you that success in CARS comes down to consistent practice. The issue with his advice is that it throws you off, so you start off doing well in CARS, but after following his bad guidance, you end up struggling. This leads you to book more sessions with him, and that's exactly what he wants. He is a terrible tutor.

to answer someone's question: My main point is that if you want to attend, students  need to go into his class with beforehand MCAT knowledge, but even then¬†**he is extremely manipulative during his individual sessions saying things like 80% of students go this right, guilt tripping, etc, and tried to make me buy another package which I declined. For younger students, I felt the need to make this post because I don't want someone else to give tuition for 2+ years and not see any results, giving this tutor thousands of dollars.**¬†The exam is in your hands but we don't want false information or to be extremely discouraged right at the beginning of MCAT journey-some amount of kindness is appreciated as well."

I have reviewed the program page (https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/human-centered-technology-innovation-design-phd), but I find that the specific research areas are not entirely clear. However, I know of a new faculty member who specializes in Operations Research, and they recommended the program to me.

"Everytime I dorm, I crash out",https://www.reddit.com/r/nyu/comments/1gnqty6/everytime_i_dorm_i_crash_out/,34,9,2024-11-10 02:48:42,"Context:

\- I had 2 terrible roomates in my freshman year

\- 1 of them was a slob, and would leave moldy food around, she put bare pizza slices in the mini fridge I bought, no plate, nothing, just on the shelf.. and they had hair on them :,)

\- the 2nd one was rich and had a shopping addiction, dozens of shopping bags took up majority of the room, and she would never sleep at night and then sleep all day, making it hard to things without distrubing her 

\-Afterwards I was traumatized so I got accomidations for a single bc I am mentally ill yayyy

  
All 3 of these senarios have lead to extreme emotional stress, not living comfortably combined with the stress of school was the perfect mix for having daily mental breakdowns. 

When I got a single dorm, not only was it expensive, I was not doing well at all. I have bipolar II, so during mania I was extremely reckless and during depressive episodes I could not get up to go to class. I wasn't taking care of myself and things seriously spiraled out of control. I ended up taking a LOA. 

  
I live on long island with my family, which is about 1 1/2hr commute and it is rough. This semester, I decided to take 4 classes on monday and wednesday and an online class on T/Th because it's less taxing than commuting to the city 4 days a week. 

For this upcoming sem, I'm considering dorming again because it'd be nice to have my days more spread out and not have 8 hrs of class + 3hrs of commuting. Now, I should make a point that, I have been much more stable compared to when I was in a single. I got out of a toxic relationship, got the right meds, and have a job, things are stable which is good in theory, however, I don't think I can do another semester of 11 hour days.

Another thing is that I feel like I can't make real friends (this is probaby me just making excuses). With having 4 classes straight, not only am I completely drained, but there is no way in hell I'm spending more time on campus afterward. Which means I can't go to study groups or hang out with people to hopefully spark a real friendship. Like I talk to ppl in my classes, but I feel like I can't have a commited friendsip without having to spend $40 to go hang out with them on a day I don't have school.

I want to try dorming again, but I'm really worried about not only the financial loss, but also my stability. Things are going pretty good and I don't want to A: be hopitalized again and B: delay my graduation even further. It's really tricky because my mental health has a huge impact on this, but also I'm worried that I might just not be built for dorming; idk I feel really alone when I'm dorming which just amplifies everything that I'm already experiencing; ahhh i just don't want to go through somthing really tramatic againnn. I know none of us can predict the furture, however, if anyone has insight, I would love to hear ü•πü•π"

There's been a few Reddit posts from over the years regarding people's experiences at NYU LA but thought I would see if anyone has gone in recent semesters. I got accepted to go for Spring 2025 but am really ambivalent about committing to it...

Any information people have about the program and their experiences would be so greatly appreciated!

In doing so, I would most likely have to spend a summer taking classes just to be able to graduate on time since all the courses I would take would be electives. 

Of course, there are a lot more factors to take into consideration but I thought I would just see what the general vibe is out there about the program while also noting that it's quite new. Any advice you can provide is extremely helpful! Thanks so much!!  "

i got 58, i know its not the best grade but i am so worried that ill gonna fail this class since I have to get at least B- in order to qualify my major curriculum.  
More, Im not used to stern curve that i have no idea how it would be so if anyone knows or have some idea, please let me know and correct me.  
If i do the math, i got a D+ or C-. and If I have to get at least B- in overall grade would it be too hard or how does it look like for you guys

btw weight for midterm is 30 and final is 35

I just want a C in the final grade. It's really too difficult. I think I'll make an appointment with the professor to talk after the midterm exam scores come out. The professor is great. I really let him down. If I get an F in the midterm, I really don't know what to do. It may be my own fault. I feel helpless and confused."

Why Hack4Impact? Well, as we all know, hiring for internships has gotten increasingly competitive, so if anyone else is looking to get some hands-on semi-professional experience while making an impact, this could be a good opportunity.

From what I understand, the application process to become a chapter can take months, and includes a chapter interview with the national board, so if anyone else is interested, let me know and if there's enough interest, we could get started on that process."

I recently received an admit for the MS in Computer Engineering (CE) program at NYU Tandon! üéâ I'm excited about the opportunity but have a few questions about career prospects.

I know the program includes a lot of hardware-focused courses, but I also see electives available in areas like Machine Learning. My goal is to work either as a Software Development Engineer (SDE), Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Engineer after graduation. 

For current students or alumni of the CEE program (or similar programs at NYU Tandon), would you mind sharing your experiences?

- Were you able to tailor your coursework to focus more on software, ML, or data-related topics?

- Did you find it challenging to land roles in these fields given the hardware-heavy curriculum?

- Any advice for balancing the hardware/software courses to build a strong profile for SDE, ML, or Data Engineer roles?

ECE related students, please take Prof. Das at your discretion.

I‚Äôm sure he is an intelligent person and engineer, but his class are just an absolute mess for me, and for most the students I‚Äôve talked to.

There are ZERO lecture slides, ZERO additional materials, and there are ZERO TA office hours.

But there ARE pop quizzes, which was not told to us anywhere on the syllabus. He swears that it will be the same as the homework - but it‚Äôs not, he makes up the question on the spot. It‚Äôs not difficult, but it‚Äôs not the same. I speculate he does this to force attendance.

He tells us to email the TA about assignments and labs, but so far he hasn‚Äôt responded to the emails I‚Äôve sent him.  

There is no lecture organization, no planned material for each week of the semester, only estimated lectured hours for each chapter. 

As stated before he has no lecture PDFs, so he freestyles on the white board. He teaches by hand-drawing circuits, which is - as you might expect - perfectly unreadable. It is extremely difficult to absorb the important material since he loves going on tangents and never specifies what will or will not be on exams. 

Seen above, our midterm date is set ‚Äútentatively‚Äù. The only reason why it wouldn‚Äôt be a set date is because it‚Äôs different for every semester he teaches. In other words, he can‚Äôt teach consistently.

We‚Äôve already spent twice the estimated hours for Chapter 1. I am not convinced that our midterm can be taken at a reasonable date without rushing/skipping over material."

We appreciate your interest in NYU! Feel free to ask questions about the school and the application process in this weekly post!

Do take advice about your chances of admission with a grain of salt:

* An application is a holistic process and we can‚Äôt see everything you submit.
* We don‚Äôt actually know what standards the admissions office uses and what they care about, we just have anecdotal evidence.
* Please direct information-sensitive questions to the [NYU Admissions Office](https://www.nyu.edu/footer/contact-us.html).
* NYU's admission rate drops every year, so even the anecdotal evidence we do have may not translate well to this year's applications."
