SCHEDULE ADVICE FOR NEW FRESHMEN,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/14km4nw/schedule_advice_for_new_freshmen/,92,22,2023-06-27 18:52:58,"Politely, I'm getting sick of seeing variations of the same thread every day. Here's the SparkNotes of making your freshman fall schedule:

- **Aim to take 12-13 hours.** You're very likely moving to a new city, completely removing your safety nets you're used to (friends, parents, etc). That's okay, but give yourself the extra time to adjust. You'll likely want to spend more time hanging out with your new buds than studying for a random 2000-level psych course anyway.

- **If you don't know what major you want to end up with, work on general credits.** things like AXLE or the Peabody core are pretty universal. If you're not sure what you want to do, start there.

- **For the love of God, don't take hard classes you don't need to.** There is literally no reason to ""retake bio as a refresher"". It's a weed out class. Take your AP credits or whatever and move on. 

- **COROLLARY: Don't take harder STEM classes because you did well in them in high school.** If I had a nickel for every CS freshman who took gen chem for no reason, I'd have like a dollar. Take something easier (EES 1510, baby bio, physics). Same goes for taking harder intro calc classes. If you don't need 1300, don't take 1300. 

- **If you want to switch to HOD after your first year, find general core classes that apply to Peabody too.** You have to wait a year to switch, but the actual switch is just getting a PDF signed. Plenty of people transfer in and finish on time just fine.

Welcome to Vanderbilt, you're gonna do great things here. But please, learn to read, learn to Google, and then if you can't find answers you can ask new questions."

off-campus living?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1gs9395/offcampus_living/,2,8,2024-11-15 22:52:12,"hello, I just got approved for off-campus housing and i'm still deliberating. 

i receive full financial aid and according to my aid officer i would be refunded the full amount of my housing and meal costs but could still purchase a meal plan.

my question is, how easy is it to find someone willing to sublet/rent out a room for a low price somewhere in SHORT walking distance to campus? basically the main reason i'd want to live off campus would just be for having my own room and private bathroom. it seems that in the on-campus housing process its exceptionally hard to get both at the same time unless you have disability accomodations. 

i don't have a car and i don't really want to have to get one either, i don't want to drive in nashville or have to pay the parking passes or anything like that. how is getting groceries ? ought i to just start having instacart delivered or whatever? i won't have much money in excess of the vandy refunds but thankfully my family has been willing to help me out up to this point so i could probably live off of instacart if i had to.

on that note, should i buy one of the commuter meal plans? or no?

im not very high maintenance at all I can live off of cereal and ramen and the little packaged fruit and chips and whatnot that you might expect to find in an elementary schooler's lunchbox lol so my food costs shouldnt be too high.

basically is living off campus worth the drawbacks of inconvenience and probably higher costs? im one of the few people on campus who really likes campus dining lol so im a little sad that off-campus folks can't get a standard meal plan but oh well

would i be better off going with some other type of housing (that rising juniors tend to have very good chances of getting?)

**Major Selection**

People from a variety of fields from engineering to communications go into consulting and investment banking, but certain majors at Vanderbilt will better prepare you for the industry.

1. Human & Organizational Development

Generally considered one of the easiest majors on campus, HOD does provide valuable soft skills and is considered a pipeline to consulting. The HOD Capstone where you engage in a full term work environment for a semester allows you to gain valuable experience in firms with established connections with Vanderbilt.

2. Economics

The typical major for IB and consulting, the concepts and quantitative skills in Econ are valuable for case interviews and finance interviews and will allow you to have a better grasp of the industry. Generally the Econ department is not regarded as being elite and some professors are questionable, but still a good pairing with HOD.

**Consulting Clubs**

1. SCNO - The longest established Pro-Bono consulting club at Vanderbilt.

2. 180DC - Established only an year ago, 180DC has several branches across US universities.

3. VU Consulting Club - Not very active and not currently recruiting for case comps but they do give good info.

**Finance Clubs**

1. Commodore Capital - Mainly WASP, Jewish organization, not a lot is known but members recruit well.

2. Scholars of Finance - The club gives you knowledge into IB and has a well established program and many branches.

3. Financial Modeling Club - Relatively new club, good for developing valuable financial modeling skills.

4. Vanderbilt Business Review - Writes weekly articles about school or broader business topics.

5. Vanderbilt Finance Club - Not very active but hosts occasional meetings and sends out information.

**Business Frats**

1. AK PSI - Oldest business frat on campus.

2. DSP - Considered up and coming.

3. Phi Chi Theta - Newest business frat on campus.

I deeply regret coming to Vanderbilt for Computer Science,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1giugme/i_deeply_regret_coming_to_vanderbilt_for_computer/,12,29,2024-11-03 19:05:36,"Why I Don't Recommend Vanderbilt for Computer Science

For background, when I was in high school I took computer science and was familiar with basic programming and CS concepts up through OOP and some basic ADTs before college. I’m glad I already had that experience learning CS, because otherwise I might have thought that the experience of learning CS at Vanderbilt was just the inherent way the subject universally is rather than a problem at the school. But because I remember what it was like before, I feel like I can justly say that Vanderbilt is not an ideal place to go, to say the least, for students interested in Computer Science.

By this, I don’t mean to say that the content of *what* they teach is grossly deficient or something—if someone is able to complete the major, they know their stuff. The problem is more with the experience of the major as a student and *how* the school goes about teaching.

A key problem is the lectures. Whether the present topic is difficult or not, the lectures default to being boring, poorly explained, giving little to no perspective on how the topic meshes with the major at-large. Content is presented in segmented info dumps. This is plain to see in the very first programming class, which is the easiest in the whole major. Even though this should be a very clear class that instills the building blocks of programming concepts, I found that the most trivial and unimportant details—for instance stuff like syntax for formatting printing to the console—were given little distinction in emphasis from what should be the key takeaways from the course. Again, it was just a massive info dump. When I was in high school, CS was seen as a treat of a class—working out problems in code was just seen as fun, and its possibilities felt exciting. It was easy to grow passionate about it. But at Vanderbilt, anecdotally at least, at the semester’s end when speaking to people who had no prior experience programming until Vandy’s intro class, I discovered they didn’t enjoy programming so much and were a little dismayed by the subject. As for me, even though I considered myself an enjoyer of programming—I even liked a few of the assignments—I was bored throughout the semester. As the major went along and I reached the end of my prior CS knowledge, I found that I was not learning in class, and everything became dependent on self-study outside the classroom. Although some teachers are even worse than others in this aspect, overall I found this problem to be relatively consistent among the teachers, at least the ones I've had.

 

Another huge problem that might go under the radar is the general attitude with which the subject is taught and handled. I would not associate words like “encouraging” or “friendly” or “happy” with the major as it is at Vanderbilt. At its best the tone is neutral; maaaybe on a good day there's an attempt to liven up the class; but at its usual worst there is a dreary air of grayness about the subject coming from the teachers. Almost like it’s not something meant to be enjoyed or found pleasant.

The homework follows suit in the displeasure. After the first programming class, most programming assignments are entrenched in a sea of riddles and deliberate vagueness that hinder not merely solving the assignment, but understanding what the assignment even is. This was incredibly stressful to experience as the difficulty of assignments and the harshness of their grading increases dramatically after the intro semester. To add fuel to the fire, a couple of teachers have a kind of smugness, evident in the way they use Piazza (an online site for the class to ask questions), that I feel is at least in part the source of their willingness to be so vague with programming assignments.

 

This leads me to maybe the most bizarre and infuriating problem with CS at Vanderbilt, which is the exceptional strictness of the Honor Code within the major. So in most majors at Vanderbilt, the Honor Code just refers to obvious rules guarding against plagiarism in essays and cheating and stuff. But in CS, the general or default rule throughout the major is that every single homework assignment must be completed wholly individually without help from one’s fellow students. The exception to this is that students may consult the professor or the certain older students that hold the position of teaching assistant in the class for assignment help. The extent to which you are permitted to discuss with classmates or the internet is general course concepts or syntax. If you go beyond this, you’re in big trouble.

I recall part of the fun of programming in high school was looking over a classmate's shoulder with a handful of friends, trying to work out a tough logic puzzle in code together. It felt like a game. That is not permitted to happen at Vanderbilt. There are a lot of conversations and probably even friendships that never happened at Vanderbilt because students are incentivized to not interact closely with each other. Just imagine if at any point in your pre-college schooling you and your classmates were not permitted to help each other with homework beyond generalities as a rule—it’s just nonsense. So much interaction in normal school is based around kids getting their peers up to speed, whether it's people crowding around the smart kid for help or just a student casually nudging their friend to ask a question about something they’re stuck on. It’s so normal you don’t even notice it. But at Vanderbilt, you must consult the pre-approved sources of knowledge alone, not your peers. I understand that there is still a need for having academic rules in CS to guard against students just getting by all four years with copy-and-pasting all their assignments from someone else without doing any work at all. Obviously. But in the form they exist, the Honor Code rules for CS at Vanderbilt are ridiculous and overreaching.

They’ve even been applied in CS classes outside of programming. I remember in the Computer Architecture class that all the homework was mandatorily individual. The homework for that class was problem sets that literally had objective answers like any math or science class—not something dependent on creativity like programming—and it was *still* under Honor Code embargo! I should note that this nonsense does not exist in Vanderbilt’s math or science classes, as far as I know. You are free to collaborate in those subjects. In theory, the Honor Code rules in CS are just the default, and the teacher could give out collaborative assignments if they wanted. But in my experience, that has only very occasionally happened in one of my classes.

The effect of the CS Honor Code policies is that you feel like you’re in exam mode 24/7. You become conscious of the particular perverseness of putting embargos on the exchange of knowledge or ideas outside of exam/quiz settings. The professors even treat the programming assignments as highly classified material *after the fact*, even though by this point students are technically free to discuss the assignment. They never care to go over the solutions to the assignments so the class can learn. Combined with the aforementioned vagueness in the presentation of the assignments, this results in keeping some students in a trench of distress and failure until they dedicate their lives to setting up camp beside the teaching assistants. It’s all just very weird.

Speaking of vagueness, the actual written Honor Code policies in each course can be ambiguous and leave room for confusion about what’s permissible. And unless I deeply misunderstand its words, there are even subtle *contradictions* in at least one honor code document for a class about what exactly is permissible in terms of communicating with peers and consulting the web. Not to mention that they don’t bother to address how to use AI, though I guess it’s presumed the rules are the same as for the web.

 

The stated reason for all these policies is to guarantee real learning, but they clearly fail in and even impede that mission. In practice, these rules, plus the smug vagueness of the assignments, are based on bad logic and are anti-student, anti-socialization, and most definitely anti-learning. If I had to say one good thing about the major at Vanderbilt, it would be that you at least aren’t forced to take Chemistry. But overall, it’s just been a terrible experience and a bad culture to be in."

However, until now, I have not been part of any team for the program.

Therefore, if anyone is looking for teammates or wants to consider me in their team, I am ready to hop on your raft!

one thing that is kind of important to me, since im still considering, is just more insight on the student body and the country vibe, and whether country = conservative? i grew up in p progressive big cities, and though i lived in the south, it again was a big p liberal city. i think stats say around \~89% is OOS so im assuming that many people come from different backgrounds and from similar positions like mine, and maybe even had the same concerns. i was looking up on nashville and it said it was a blue dot in a red state, but any information would be great! and while ik student body is usually (for other schools) 50/50 or wtv, im still curious if its easy to find people who are progressive and liberal down there or just how that aspect of student life is. (also, while this may not be a big deal for others, the political area of the school is a kind of big factor in my consideration.)

ik nashville has a country sort of vibe to it, and ive never been part of that life ever just because i never grew up in that atmosphere, so if anyone has moved from a big (non-country?) city to vandy/nashville, what's that ""culture shock"" (for lack of a better term) like? and is it easy to adapt into that culture?

also (so many questions, sorry!) i was scrolling through some posts here that were talking about the difficulties of math at vandy, and i want to apply as engineering (either do mechE or EE?). my school is really freakin intense and I passed my hs calc bc class w a B (broke my heart) but i got a 5 in the exam. im taking multi var/linear alg this yr. my school's math classes are really intense and the teachers don't really teach, so i'm wondering if any of these skills would make it easier to navigate vandy math? and if they dont, are there tutoring resources/how would i go about getting help in math? :)

finally, any other insight about vandy would be appreciated! :) other smaller qs i have is like how easy it is to move off campus, job opportunities during college (bc i wanna work through my 4 years, are there student jobs/other jobs in the area that are easy to work?)? club life? any stories of going abroad? job placement after? etc. :)

tysm!! ik this was a lot but i think (again) vandy would be a good fit for me academically and financially (if i can get scholarships and bc their financial aid is great), just tryna see if theres any insight from current students/alum at all :) ANY information yall would recommend for a prospective student to know would be really appreciated (any pros/cons). much love and sorry for the long post!"

I’m wondering if this is just a coincidence in my “survey” or if it's actually common at Vanderbilt to double major.

Here’s my situation: I’m on track to graduate early without the CS major, saving around $100k and an entire year. If I do decide to double major in CS, I’m thinking it might give me an edge when applying for jobs. But I’m also a pretty dedicated self-learner and feel confident I can pick up the necessary CS skills on my own, which leads me to these questions:

1. **Is the CS major at Vanderbilt really worth the extra cost ($100k) as a second major, especially if I could graduate early?**
2. **In terms of job applications, is having a CS major actually crucial, or is a minor good enough? Would being self-taught put me at a disadvantage?**

I was a College Prep Scholar in my junior year (if that helps). My worst fear is not becoming a finalist at least for QB. 

  
1). I do come from a low-income household (4 people in my family and my mom makes 20K a year. She is also a single mother and I have no contact or knowledge of my father). 

2). My EC are AAK (Volunteer), Summer Bridge (Volunteer),  NKLB (Mentorship Program), First Tech Challenge, FBLA, NHS, SNHS, Journalism, Alief Votes, Stem Program, and Red Cross. I know that having these EC doesnt mean much since I want to head into pre-med. I do these things because I enjoy them and I will incorporate that in my essays at least. 

  
3). I also have done 2 internships during my sophomore and junior summer. I did a Biomedical research program with Vanderbilt in 2023 and got a certificate from it. In addition, I did a clinical internship at a clinic in Sugar Land and these experiences really taught me what pre-med was. 

  
4). My main goal right now is to portray myself as someone with spirit and dedication. I believe that if I portray myself as the perfect student it wouldn't really help out with much, so any advice?

I took Linear algebra at my previous uni, but was evaluated as 2410 methods of linear algebra instead of 2600 linear algebra.  

I am planning for honors in mathematics in which 2410 would not suffice. What’s the appeal process/can i submit documentation such as exams, assignments to aid in this process or will I need to retake linear algebra here?  

> The Standard and Honors Tracks of the math major specify ONLY Math 2600 or 2500/2501 for the linear algebra requirement, and ONLY Math 2610 for the differential equations requirement. Once you have declared a math major, you CANNOT satisfy these requirements with Math 2410 or 2420, respectively.

>However, you may have taken Math 2410 or 2420 before you declared a math major, because you were not originally planning to major in math. If this is the case, we will permit you to count Math 2410 for the linear algebra requirement or Math 2420 for the differential equations requirement in Standard or Honors Track.

>Anyone intending to pursue Standard or Honors Track of the math major should plan to take Math 2600 (or 2500/2501) and 2610, NOT 2410 and 2420.

I found this in the catalog. It seems like this would this apply since I haven’t declared a major yet (i’m an incoming freshman). However, if you just have to take it before you declare your math major, wouldn’t everyone just take 2410? I know linear algebra is usually a soph class but with ap calc bc credit you would likely take it second semester freshman year which seems common enough.  


I am going to meet with my advisor about some of this, but people on here seem to generally have good advice or helpful suggestions that are sometimes more practical, so I thought I’d ask here as well.

I published a paper on my own in high school but that was different as a mentor guided it through a paid program.

From what I understand, however, the best way to get a paper published is through a lab. I don't know if this is the only way to do it. Secondly, there are SO MANY labs at Vanderbilt, and I am struggling to understand which one is willing to help students with paper publication (contrary to other labs that are like wet/dry labs with no paper component and just fun, busy work). 

I know that I should not rush into these things, but I was hoping if someone could paint the picture of what next steps I should take to get started! Just feeling lost right now. "

rising soph here, looking for an interesting bonus class to audit on top of my less-interesting required courseload. but so far (including a couple inquiries i made last semester) i am 0/3 on being approved. am i just having bad luck? are specific types of classes more or less likely to allow auditors? none of the classes were at full capacity. in fact one prof emailed me about a month before classes started before last spring semester, and told me to check again before class started to ensure there would be room in the class. then i did exactly that, and the enrollment wasn't even 2/3 full, but she said the class capacity would not allow an auditor. like... okay, i guess.

ive emailed a fourth prof and am currently waiting for a response, but if she turns me down i probably won't bother again as there's not really any other classes i would want to audit this semester.

if anyone has had success, was there anything in particular you said in the email that might help? my emails have literally been one line long, short and to the point, because i know professors are busy and don't like students to waste their time with long emails.

and if anyone's wondering why i don't just take the class P/F, for one it's because i'd rather not have any P/F credits on my transcript unless there just ends up being something i really struggle with, and 2. im at the 18 credit hour limit with classes i need for majors/minors/AXLE and the potential audit fulfills none. It's not an emergency where i couldn't put off one of the requirements for a later semester, but i'd rather not as the classes i've found to fulfill them in this semester look really interesting and ideal and some of them are quite rare.

thank you!"

Choosing which subject to minor in,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1ecfwdu/choosing_which_subject_to_minor_in/,3,3,2024-07-26 05:06:18,"I am an incoming Junior transfer student majoring in Economics at Vanderbilt. With all of my AXLE and a lot of my Economics major requirements already fulfilled due to credit transfers, I am now focusing on meeting the 60 credit hours taken solely at Vanderbilt required for graduation.

In order to get to >=15 credit hours per semester, I am considering adding a minor in either HOD, Business, or both. My degree audit suggests that while a double major is not feasible, pursuing both minors is possible. However, an advisor mentioned that instead of a double minor, I could opt for a single minor and take additional courses outside of degree requirements purely for personal interest and exploration.

Since I've heard that minors aren't too impactful on career recruitment, particularly in consulting—which I am interested in—I was hoping to receive some advice on whether pursuing the HOD and Business minors would be better or if just doing one minor and using that extra time to take classes in other subject areas that I am interested in would be better. Do any of you have experience in this?

TL;DR: For consulting, should I double minor in HOD and Business with my Econ major, or just have one minor and take classes covering my other interests?"

you'll be sharing the house with my two awesome roommates: a vandy phd student in anthropology and a pharmD student at belmont university, both are women in their twenties. they like to keep the common living areas clean and neat. they are super friendly and enjoy exploring Nashville on the weekends. they like hanging out in the evenings but also respect each other’s space and alone time!

  
this sublease is only available for the fall semester, so it is ideal for someone new to the area, like an incoming graduate student who is looking for a temporary place within walking distance of campus, and intending to find a more permanent place in the spring.

or, an undergraduate who is only looking for housing in the fall as they will be studying abroad in the spring.

I'm interested in a political science related major, and at Vanderbilt it would probably be something like polisci major with a minor in world politics, and a focus of international relations. Tbh, I wasn't psyched about a poli-sci major, and I originally wanted a major like Development studies, Human rights, International relations, International Development, International Law, or Public administration. This is with the hopes of working for an organization like the UN. I also think their honors program seems pretty cool and interesting, but this is only the second school I've looked like so idk what most are like. So I'm wondering, is Vanderbilt really worth it for polisci? Or should I look elsewhere? The only reason it came up for me at first is because of its affordability, which is really important for me!

Also, how do yall think the AP credits will transfer? My brother took 16 total AP tests so he could start college in his jr year. I'm doing the same thing, and Vanderbilt would be out of the picture if they don't accept my credits. Here's what I'm hoping I'll have:

APHug  
World  
APES  
E. Lang, S. Lang, E. Lit S. Lit (and maybe Italian lang)  
Calc AB and BC  
APUSH  
Physics (idk which one my school has)  
Macro and Micro  
2D Art/Design  
US Gov  
Psych

In your experience, were these accepted? Did they use these to let you start in your junior year?

Thanks so much for the help!!!"

I don't think I would have a hard time learning the content because I have a strong foundation in calculus (my local university splits multivariable into calc 3 and multivar, and I took calc 3, so I'm guessing about half of the content will be review), and I would say an above average foundation in orgo (my highschool offered an orgo class, although it was only one semester and fairly easy. But to my knowledge, not many schools offer one at all so I think I'm sitting well). However, if theres a lot of coursework to be completed that will be overwhelming whether or not I know the content, I would be hesitant to take them together.
2. I've also heard us elections is very easy and since its only offered every 4 years and is an AXLE class I Would like to take that. I would also assume core 1010 isn't too hard considering its a pilot class for new freshman and all the professors have 5star rating and around 2.0 difficulty on ratemyprofessor. 1010 and 1020 both satisfy 2 axle requirements each which seems really good
3. Originally I was going to only take orgo this year and bio next year because there seems to be an advantage to taking orgo as a freshman with the smaller class size and what not. Is this true or should I just take it next year?
4. I decided I needed bsci 1510 this year since its a prereq for other classes. But I'm having a hard time figuring out which ones to take first and so if anyone has a 4 year plan template for cellular and molecular biology majors that would be super helpful just to get an idea for a template. I tried using the what if degree audit thing but it doesn't show I've satisfied any requirements even after i load courses into the planner.

Any advice or thoughts on any of this would be helpful.

edit: Right now, my plan is to take all of them and utilize the one week drop period if needed. Is there anything I need to keep in mind if I take this route?"

Appeal Process? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1dfyzvc/appeal_process/,0,1,2024-06-14 19:24:38,"Hey everyone, I was recently denied a transfer to Vanderbilt. I submitted everything except one document by the priority deadline and have a cum 3.6 GPA with a 4.0 GPA last semester and a 1500 SAT. The missing document was my college report, which got delayed because my university processed my financial aid very late. I could only send the letter to Vanderbilt about two weeks before my decision was released. Even though I somewhat explained my situation before and after sending the letter, I have a feeling that my application was dismissed before they got my college report.

The issue is, I don't think I conveyed just how difficult paying my tuition was this year. I spent last year studying abroad in Germany through my current university. This past semester, I had to notarize and fax an ID to my university for my federal aid to be released. Navigating the notary systems in Germany as a non-English speaker was a nightmare, as most notaries didn't process non-German documents. After weeks of appointments with multiple notaries, I finally found a few who could help, but their services cost me hundreds of dollars. This whole process took about two months, and then my university took another month and a half to process my aid.

I did everything as quickly as possible, but these issues pretty severely delayed me. I want to appeal and emphasize how my financial struggles and the delay in processing my tuition payments messed with my application, especially with submitting my college report late. I did mention that my college letter was delayed because I was abroad, but I feel like giving more details about my long journey to pay my tuition might help.

I need help finding information about the appeal process on the admissions page. I asked the ""Cornelius"" bot about appealing a transfer decision, and it said there was an appeal process for reconsidering apps with incorrect information. That's not exactly my situation, but I still want to try to appeal. How do I go about submitting an appeal? Do I email the Dean Provost or reach out to my counsellor again? Is there a physical form or website for appeals that I should be looking at?

Any help or advice is welcome; I'm really hoping there's something I can do. Thanks, everyone! "

Vanderbilt or USC,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1dffwbb/vanderbilt_or_usc/,0,9,2024-06-14 02:05:17,"Hi students of Vanderbilt,

I am a recently accepted transfer student. As title says, I am facing a conundrum between two great schools. Both I can see, to a degree, their flaws (or ways they mismatch with me). 

For Vanderbilt, it is:

1. Is Vanderbilt favorable for Asians?

I spent my first year of college in the West Coast, and coming from the Northeast, I found the environment generally a lot more ""Asian"", where it was more comfortable being Asian, if that makes sense. Although I still love the Northeast and the climate here... Is Vanderbilt welcoming towards Asian students? For example, are there a lot of Asian Americans in frats and sororities? Do Asian students take leadership positions at Vanderbilt?

2. Does Vanderbilt foster entrepreneurship and creativity? 

Going to another post someone posted on another thread on Reddit, I found that ""...What kinds of people do you think would hate your school?:  People who dislike conformity, or who highly value individual expression...the average Vandy student isn't staying up until 2 discussing the meaning of life or debating philosophy. A lot of people who are at Vanderbilt that hate it really belonged at a small liberal arts college in the Northeast."" 

My goal is to be an entrepreneur, to be part of a founding of a company and making product for people. I want to go to Vanderbilt, or any college, for good training on this matter. A strong technical foundation (CS), but more importantly, people skills and the right MIND to tackle the sort of challenges found in startups. Is Vanderbilt oriented for this kind of career?

I want to give a last thing, which is my other school which admitted me is USC. So if you know anything about that school, I would find that helpful too, given what was said above. "

Ochem vs Gen chem,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1d8g65h/ochem_vs_gen_chem/,2,11,2024-06-05 03:22:19,"I had a question about which one to take. I am entering vandy as a freshman with a 5 on AP Chemistry, meaning I can skip gen chemistry and take ochem for advanced placement students. 

  
My advisor recommended that I take gen chem as ochem is typically for chemistry majors, which I understand. More importantly, he had told me that **med schools are looking for 3 years of chemistry with one year being inorganic chemistry**. If I were to take ochem, that means I would end up having to take a higher level chem elective to satisfy that requirement. For example, I looked into pchem which is difficult (based on rate my professors and I dont have an interest in mvar calc - coreq). 

  
Long story short, I want some guidance as to what to do: 

1)  
For one, do most med schools require inorganic chemistry (or at least the highly ranked ones)? I believe, for example, great med schools like Vanderbilt University School of Medicine takes AP credit for inorganic chemistry. This would mean, I would not need to take that 3rd year higher elective chem.  

2)  
Secondly, outside of that, I have heard that Vanderbilt's gen chem is considered tougher than ochem...Is this true? Do you guys suggest that I skip gen chem with my 5 on AP Chem or retake gen chem? 

3)  
Lastly, if you guys do suggest I skip gen chem and take ochem, other than pchem, what other inorganic chemistry courses can I take to satisfy that requirement (I dont want to take pchem). "

 I am a rising sophomore at GMU. My major is Neuroscience on the pre-med track and I am thinking of pursuing a minor in music. Next spring I am considering applying to a couple schools to transfer. 

My GPA is a 3.74 (my first semester, fall 2023, I had a 3.45 GPA I was not prepared for college courses, 2 Bs and 1 A- and this last semester, Spring 2024, I received a 4.0). I now figured out the best way to study. 

Here are my ECs:
I am currently shadowing an ENT doctor and will have around 150 hours by next spring, I am currently enrolled in an EMT course and will be certified by the end of this month, I am close to finishing up my first publication by the end of this summer (1st author), I am volunteering at my local high school’s food pantry and an emergency department in my area, I also presented my research at a poster presentation in May and I am going to join a cancer research lab starting in August. I worked in the office of undergrad education in my uni as a front desk assistant this past semester too for 150 hours. I also worked as a medical assistant in Europe last summer in a radiology clinic.

After my EMT training I will start volunteering at hospices and nursing homes in my area by playing the guitar for them (I have been a guitarist for the past 8 years), I might shadow a neurosurgeon, I will also start work as an EMT in my local ED,  will volunteer at the crisis hotline, and I will release my first single with my band this summer. 

I am currently in the process of learning my 3rd and 4th languages: Spanish and German.

I am wondering what my chances are to applying to this institution as a transfer student.

Purely based on my online research, I’m having a really hard time determining what the vibe of the student body really is. 

Talking to people, seems everyone here either thinks 1) it’s purely a frat/tailgate party school or 2) it’s basically the academic equivalent to harvard, just with a happier student body. I’m assuming the truth is somewhere in between, but I have no idea where along that spectrum.

I like having fun, but I’m more serious and academic and am very much a west-coaster, so I’m hoping for it to be closer to the second option (or at least that there would be enough more nerdy-types that I would “find my people”), but please warn me away if this isn’t the case.

I’d be content at a “work hard, play hard” school, but need to make sure the “work hard” element is culturally there also, vs this translating to “party school where people happen to get good grades”.

UCI is a very preferable school for me with favored locations and personal factors, so I'm really just curious to if Vanderbilt is better enough in their CS dept and opportunities to justify taking a risk on it, as most of the research and qualifications I found for CS was mostly vague and optimistic at best. For context I would be potentially paying an extra 11k overall (through the entire 4 years) to go to Vanderbilt, and that is a very considerable amount of money for me, especially as I'll be helping put my sister in college soon.

Right now, it feels to me as if I'm just paying a lot extra for just the name and that just doesn't seem very valuable, especially as a CS major. However, I'm concerned that there is stuff I could be overlooking by a long shot and that the extra 11k into Vanderbilt may actually come a long way for me. Already been doing a lot of back and forths on this decision, so any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Should I really avoid Broadview?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1cp3pbp/should_i_really_avoid_broadview/,6,8,2024-05-10 23:40:32,"I'm an undergrad looking for an apartment for next year and it's really been a struggle to find a good place. I am looking for a studio close to campus (no car). I have seen a ton of bad things about Broadview on here but as far as I can tell the only reasons are that it is expensive, has cheap appliances, and rooms are small.

I have spent a lot of time looking through listings close to campus and rooms of comparable price such as Hayes House or Chateau are currently 1500$/month (Broadview studio is 1400$) and have plenty of their own problems such as run-down rooms or maintenance issues. Meanwhile Broadview seems like it has a lot of pros, including the price, safety (all tenants affiliated with university), and new/modern facilities (even if they are cheap). 

I don't really have concerns about the space and I will only be living there for one year, so Broadview seems like a good option. I just wanted to get other people's opinions if there are other reasons not to pick Broadview or if it sounds like it makes sense for me."
Hard Decision between Vanderbilt and NYU Stern,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1cou5s4/hard_decision_between_vanderbilt_and_nyu_stern/,3,20,2024-05-10 16:48:40,"Hello r/Vanderbilt. I recently got off the waitlist at NYU Stern after being committed to Vandy off the waitlist for the HOD Major. I got admitted to Stern off the waitlist as a finance major and I’d be in London the first year and I have til 5/13 at night to decide if I want to commit.

This is an extremely hard decision for me because I believe Vandy is a very prestigious Jack of all trades school with academic flexibility, school spirit, and a centralizing college campus and experience which is definitely what I want. NYU Stern I feel would lock me into IB and while I would like to go into this field, I am also considering things such as Law School and I feel Vandy would offer more flexibility. But I also know the Stern name and location is very powerful and a lot of people have told me I can’t turn that down. Also I feel like first year in London could be transformative but is risky.

Has anyone ever made a similar decision? Anyone have any input? I’m so lost right now, I feel I’d be more comfortable to explore at Vandy but I also would feel guilty for turning down Stern.

Vandy or NYU in my case?"

Obviously a 3.619 is suicide for freshman applicants (I did get straight rejected lol RD this yr), but with a 4.0 college GPA and a 35 ACT (50th percentile iirc), is soph transfer still doable or a tremendous uphill battle?

How to deal with perfectionism at Vandy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1cjlehw/how_to_deal_with_perfectionism_at_vandy/,1,5,2024-05-03 22:44:58,"I know this might seem like an issue not worth complaining about, but I received my first B+ this semester. Although I put in a LOT of effort, I feel that I could have done more to prepare. In a sense, I feel like I have failed by not living up to the expectations I have set for myself. Vanderbilt is a highly rigorous school, and “perfection” (i.e achieving the highest possible grade in every class or continuously being accepted to highly regarded internships) almost never happens. At the same time, I feel that the culture here pretty consistently pushes a perfectionist philosophy on its students. I want the best grades, I want the best job, I want to go to a great grad school but I don’t know why short of the fact that it’s desired by everyone else. What do I do?

However, I'm unsure about Vanderbilt's reputation in finance and the strength of its Economics program. Cost is another major factor—Vanderbilt is nearly three times more expensive than Warwick, due in part to an extra year of study and also because I'm international.

- PHYS 1602 + PHYS 1602L (4 credits)1

- CS 3251 (3 credits)

- ENG 1111 (3 credits)

  
I'm only doing 13 credit hours each semester because I don't want to be stressed out and I need a high GPA for recruiting. Since I get 20 open elective credit hours, I will be using that to fulfill my applied math major. Honestly considering doing the bare minimum of 12 credits/semester from sophomore year on."

I notice that a good fraction of the EE profs seem to be double-affiliated with something bio-related, and even the ones that aren't will often highlight the relevance of their work to medical applications. 

Perhaps that's just reflective of how the department gets funded -- but I'm wondering if there is a decent fraction of EE students that have interests in more traditional applications of EE, including things like computer systems, chip design, audio and signal processing, power systems, green energy, etc? 

If you're a Vandy EE student who is not oriented towards BME or pre-med, I'd love to hear whether you'd recommend the EE program. (Feel free to DM if you would rather not post publicly.) Thanks!

Curious on people's thoughts and perspectives when comparing up against UT Knoxville.  Thanks in advance."
vandy for disabled students?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1c4zep3/vandy_for_disabled_students/,3,10,2024-04-15 22:18:45,"i'm a prospective student who visited recently for MOSAIC/anchor day. looking to major within peabody but possibly double across peabody and a&s. i'd be a CV scholar so i'm also required to take honors courses (a&s + peabody share them). 

while i was here something that definitely concerned me was the long walk between the main campus and peabody/commons. i have POTS that's currently somewhat controlled by medication, but it's not a medication i'll be able to take long term. especially during warm weather, i have a hard time with spending a lot of time walking/on my feet, and was definitely not feeling great after walking from commons to the bookstore and back with my host a few days ago. 

especially as it gets warm at vandy during the early fall and late spring, how much walking should i expect to have to do? are there any accommodation options for people who can't necessarily walk the full distance? would i be able to still live at commons/somewhere in the middle after my freshman year? i've seen people around with mobility aids but would appreciate some more disabled students' perspectives."

HELLO VANDERBILT!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1c4nl6s/hello_vanderbilt/,1,1,2024-04-15 14:27:21,"Hi, I am a prospective student in Vanderbilt for undecided engineering. However, I am really conserned about my future career. 

My initial thought was that because VU is a private school, they have more 💰💰💰 to spend on their students. However, is this applicable for **international students??** 

Also, I am also accepted to UCB, but with a major which I did not want. If I wanted to, I could switch major to applied math, but it will take a while. For Vanderbilt, I am super happy that I got accepted as an undecided major engineering student, and that I could easily choose majors that I want. 

Besides that, VU has less student-teacher ratio, which is really good for education. But is there more to this?

I heard that there are new professors from MIT in VU, especially in Engineering. I would love to have classes with them... Is this worth it?

I also think that internships are really important for me. If I get accepted to any of FAANG companies (my dream), it is really far from the actual place, so it would be a hassle to move back and forth. Also, the probability of me getting accepted from them would be lower since I am not in their region.   


These questions went through my head while I was deciding, and if you read until this far, I really appreciate it. Please leave a comment below if you can answer one of the questions above. Thanks in advance. 😃"

\-Internship opportunities are hard to come by and when they do, they're paired with Vandy Med and not fully CS

\-Career fairs are useless for CS kids since every company comes for econ

As I'm thinking IB, PE, and HF as my career after graduating, I was thinking Econ+HOD because Econ is Econ and HOD seemed like the major that helps you network with your alumni and get internships. But I recently noticed that HOD is more for people interested in consulting. So I was thinking few other options. 

&#x200B;

1. Econ + Math: do you think this combo is doable? I'm pretty confident with math but I can't say that I'm really good at it. College math will be different from high school so I was wondering if doing Econ and math at the same time would be very difficult. 
2. Econ + CS: Since I was interested in CS for a few years while I was high school and since it's such a popular major, I thought of double majoring in CS and Econ. But again, I'm worried about the difficulty of CS at Vanderbilt. 
3. Would not majoring in HOD give me a disadvantage in getting an internship?
4. Is AXLE that bad? It seems like one of the reasons people choose HOD is because they can avoid AXLE. Is it that scary? And do you start AXLE from first year if you're admitted as a CAS student?

I also want to know more about internships and employments, because I think internships are the most important things to do for a job in the future. Some say when one applies for the internship in a certain area, the **company will prioritize the ones within their region**...Looking at Vanderbilt University it's not that near from famous tech companies. I'm just worried about that too. 

One more thing, I saw in the official website that Vanderbilt offer us 4 years of their dorm to stay. I just wanted to check if the dorm quality is good overall. Because I am an **international** student, and **first time going to US**, I actually have no clue if it's **livable for 4 years** or not. I asked a person who was studying in UCB, and they said the dorm sucks. He thinks that Vanderbilt has better dorm, and I think so too. I looked at youtube videos about the dorms for Vanderbilt, and I am pretty sure it's decent. However, just to make sure I wanted to ask you guys if it's actually fine to say for 4 years.

These are some aspects that matter to me:

Location 

Cost Considerations: Evaluating living expenses/travelling in Los Angeles and Nashville.

Education Quality: Delving into the specifics and nuances of the Eco-Maths programs beyond general reputation and rankings.

Type of courses offered

Rankings: Program-specific rankings for future opportunities and job prospects?

Job Placement Focus: Importance of strong alumni networks and career support in finance fields (IB and priv equity).

Type of recruiting companies that come

Internship opportunities 

Work-life balance

Type of people at the university - whether its full of rich kids (basically as a middle class student (not very rich but can afford the college) will I be able to keep up with the lifestyle)

Enjoyable College Experience: Seeking a memorable time with a vibrant campus life and extracurriculars."

here are the main things I'm considering

Vandy pros

\- scholarship!! still in shock

\- priv school so easier to get research and smaller classes

\- good social scene

\- easier to switch major (I'm 90% sure i wanna do engineering but not sure i wanna stick with chem e)

vandy cons

\-really far from home + mid food(?)

\- engineering is not as good as ucla/berkeley

\-smaller asian population? (I'm worried might be harder to find community or friends or wtv)

UCLA pros

\-it's UCLA 😓

\-amazing food 😋, social scene, in LA

\-really good engineering program

UCLA cons

\- really big student body so hard to get research/other opportunities, big classes

\-harder to switch major

berkeley pros

\-literally #2 for major i applied, inredible engineering program

berkeley cons

\- competitive and toxic environment (esp for stem? from what i heard)

\-super big classes, hard to switch major"

Apologies for the word salad, but I am really distressed right now because I received an email today saying I am  missing one course requirement (one HODH elective)  in order for me to walk for graduation. I feel like an idiot because I used the what-if audit instead of the main one due to my minor not being updated to it yet and had the wrong idea of what classes I needed to graduate. I submitted my learning plan in October of 2023 with this erroneous assumption. My advisor and the HOD team signed off on it. I am just confused how the administration only gave me one month to figure out how to solve this mess that they signed off on. I checked thoroughly through all of my emails and NO ONE notified me of my mistake. I basically gave them the same learning plan I did for my current semester, and no one caught the fact I could have taken this extra elective this past semester.

I am wondering if it is anyway possible for me to walk despite missing one course. I do not want to postpone my graduation to next semester over ONE class. That will financially kill my family. Please give me any advice or knowledge. I immediately reached out to my advisor, but she basically told me this wasn't her problem (Yolanda McDonald). I am so frustrated right now and I feel so blind sighted so any advice is appreciated.

"What is the ""real"" acceptance rate? (Brain exercise)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1bok0fo/what_is_the_real_acceptance_rate_brain_exercise/,0,5,2024-03-26 21:41:12,"Here is what I mean, Vanderbilt posts their average scores and GPA, and stuff like that. Let's say that a student fell within those averages. What is the ""real"" acceptance rate (assuming many students get rejected for not being academically qualified)? Let's try it for Regular Decision only.

&#x200B;

I am just bored, and I am just having fun with my brain, theorizing.

&#x200B;

4.2% -- RD acceptance rate

15.7% -- ED acceptance rate

I have been thinking, I believe the ""real"" acceptance rate would be very similar to the ED acceptance rate. Many people say ED boosts your chances, but I really believe that is not true, especially for highly selective schools. I believe that colleges pick their best fits and weigh their academics equally. While there might be a little advantage, comparable to being legacy, it is not enough. Therefore, I assume maybe 16% might be the ""real"" acceptance rate for RD Vanderbilt (assuming you fit in the average ranges of admitted students). It also makes sense to me because many colleges are marketing their universities a TON, in order to get a low acceptance rate to boost their college ranking. So I am pretty certain that while the RD acceptance rate is extremely low, it is false (16%, if it is the real acceptance rate, is still really low, after all it is a selective school). 16% Is my guess, but I am open to seeing what others think.

&#x200B;

What do you guys think? Higher, lower? I chose to put it on Vanderbilt just because many ivy league schools have higher acceptance rates than this university (well it depends on what class years you compare). I am not shaming Vanderbilt, they're a good school, but I also think they're really smart, and are trying to flood their applicant pools with as many applicants as possible (like many selective colleges are doing nowadays, including ivy league)."

So, from CS majors on this sub - which is better?  I've heard varying things from many people. These are the most important factors for me in order:

1) Curriculum rigor

2) Internship recruiting and job fairs

3) Undergraduate Research Opportunities (CS related but can be interdisciplinary)

4) Career related activities (clubs, fellowships) on campus

should i come here,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vanderbilt/comments/1b6vsmu/should_i_come_here/,6,3,2024-03-05 03:57:59,"hi everyone, freshmen at a pretty small school near boston (you can figure out by reading my post history lol). I have some questions before i bother submitting an app here.

note that i am interested in the medicine, health, and society major and maybe a cs minor, I am from MA and black female

1. how was your experience with adjusting? was it hard to meet people entering as a sophomore (especially transfers)? and how was your roommate situation? (my school makes all the first years go random and i am not having a good time here)
2. did vandy take most of your courses? in other words, can you still graduate on time?
3. how is the medicine, health, and society major? i'm more interested in global health or the health behaviors and health sciences track? can you get into research labs on and off campus with that major. my current school has a public health track but there is a huge lack of quantative courses (i want to specialize on epidemiology/biostats in grad school)
4. how easy is it to get into courses here
5. campus culture? a big reason for transferring because of how dead my college is on the weekends (we don't really have a tailgating or sports culture, also lots of people just don't go out or go home) and there's not much to do walking distance of campus (no bars, concerts, mainly food places which are not college student friendly in terms of budget). also how huge is greek life (looking at NPHC and NPC sororities) and is it even necessary to join? southern rush scares me lol
6. what is nashville like? what kind of food can you get there? is it walkable (in other words, should i get a car)? do a bunch of ppl use fakes at the bars here? i want to go out but i don't want to be restricted to bars/frats all the time? there's prolly a lot more black people but i am west african not AA
7. what is one thing you hate about vandy that you could change (black students chime in especially!!!)"

Grad students! We have started our unionization campaign.

As graduate workers at Vanderbilt University, we are coming together to bargain collectively with university management to improve our working conditions. By partnering with UAW, we are joining tens of thousands of graduate student workers at universities like Columbia University, Harvard University, and New York University who have unionized to win better pay and benefits and improve our education and training. We know that only through collective action can we secure the rights we all deserve as teaching and research assistants. Our work sustains the University, and we are simply asking the University to sustain us in return.

Without a union:

Vanderbilt administration unilaterally determines our working conditions and can change them at any time without our consent.


With a union:

We elect a bargaining committee that gathers input from graduate researchers, teachers, fellows and teaching assistants across campus to develop our priorities.

Our bargaining committee negotiates on equal footing toward a fair agreement with Vanderbilt administration.

We decide democratically, through a vote, whether to approve any agreement as our contract.

That contract secures our terms and conditions of employment and is binding and enforceable, usually through appeal to a neutral arbitrator.

Thank you for your interest in Vanderbilt and for taking the time to apply for the Ingram Scholars Program. The selection committee met to identify finalists for the Program. Selecting the finalists was, as always, extremely difficult given the outstanding leadership and community service records of over 1,000 candidates. I regret to inform you that you have not been selected as an Ingram Scholarship finalist.



Given the devotion you have shown to service, I anticipate that you will continue in your service effort. While enrolled at Vanderbilt, our Office of Active Citizenship and Service will surely value your involvement. This office facilitates Vanderbilt activities with programs such as Alternative Spring Break, Habitat for Humanity, and Best Buddies, just to name a few. Also, please keep in mind that Ingram Scholarships are awarded to currently enrolled first-year students each year, and you are welcome to apply again for the scholarship.



The process of selecting scholarship recipients is still ongoing for other awards we administer, including the Cornelius Vanderbilt and Chancellor's Scholarships. Award recipients will be notified by a separate email during the month of March or with an offer of admission.



Please note that the largest share of dollars we offer to incoming students is in the form of need-based financial assistance. We are committed to making a Vanderbilt education affordable for families based upon our three commitments:

*Our admissions process is entirely need-blind for U.S. Citizens and eligible non-citizens. This means that your family's ability to pay for a Vanderbilt education is not a factor in our admissions process.



*Vanderbilt will meet 100% of a family's demonstrated financial need for all admitted students. Many students often pay no more to attend Vanderbilt than they would pay to attend a college with a lower total cost.



*Need-based financial aid packages include no need-based loans. This initiative does not involve income bands or ""cut-offs"" used to determine levels of eligibility and applies to all admitted U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens with demonstrated financial need.



If you have applied for need-based financial aid, you will receive notification of your financial aid award at the time of the offer of admission. If you feel that you will require need-based student financial assistance but have not yet completed the application process for need-based aid, visit our website at www.vanderbilt.edu/financialaid for complete application instructions and additional information."

Last year I had a different financial aid advisor and she was really helpful and I ended up getting reimbursed second semester last year. I’m a Questbridge student so generally the same advisor will help Questbridge students, and they changed the advisor this year and I’ve been having troubling navigating financial aid. I went from receiving 1k for the whole year to almost paying 2k this year, and when asking my advisor why at first she told me that I wasn’t a freshman anymore and lost a scholarship, then she said that me and my family both made more money, but then she said that my family’s income doesn’t matter and it’s because I made more money so they took financial aid away? I didnt make that much more money and I’m really confused because I just work part time off campus and worked all throughout high school and not sure why I’m having aid taken away?? Like my family is low income and can’t support me financially at all so I have to work more to pay off school but I’m having to pay because I work?? I’m mostly working because I have to support myself and I pay for all my plane tickets and I’ve run into a lot of medical issues these past couple years that student insurance doesn’t cover a lot of so I’m also working more to help cover for that. I feel really defeated and not really sure where to go from here?

tldr; low income student (~20k family of 5) got refunded 1k last year but having to pay almost 2k this year because of working even though I have to work to support myself financially
