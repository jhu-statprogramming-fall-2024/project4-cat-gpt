I have not done as well as I could have in my premed classes at Duke. I get A's in mostly all of my classes except the explicit premed courses(C, B-, B, B+). I'm projected to graduate with a 3.4 sGPA. It's only that because my other science courses help to increase my BCPM by a little. I am a first gen student who did not know what they were getting themselves into when coming to Duke for undergrad. I have a good amount of volunteering hours(consistent 2 hours weekly since freshman year for a mentorship program, about 100 hours at the Duke Hospital, and about 50 hours at the Nursing home in durham). I have yet to shadow any doctors. I have held multiple leadership position, and I have research experience(500+ hours) and presented our work in 3 conferences so far. I have also worked part time for 2 semesters but shortly stopped as school became really difficult and my mental health was not good. The only thing is that my premed courses grades are HORRIBLE. At this point I feel like there is NO hope for me getting into medical school even if I can do well on the MCAT. I really hoped to go to med school with only one gap year but idk if that possible. I know everyone's path isn't linear but I was hoping to go in asap as a first gen. I am so stressed and I feel like I have to chose another career path. I have lost all motivation and can't study even when I do have time. I'm not sure about postbacc or smp programs either because those can be very costly and usually do not give finaid. I really hoped to get into a MD school in the future for whatever speciality I may choose in the future. I don't know what to do."

1. I've not gotten into research at college yet. Was hoping to spend the next 3 semesters working with a lab, since I don't see myself getting the opportunity to research after undergrad. But if I go away senior fall, I wouldn't get the chance to work with the lab and maybe publish a paper/work on a thesis.

2. I'm already studying abroad Junior Fall, and idk if it's the best thing to be away from Duke 2 semesters. Don't know what's more impactful/ creates more memories in the long term

Not registered to vote in Durham County? It's not too late!,https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/1gh5r7m/not_registered_to_vote_in_durham_county_its_not/,16,0,2024-11-01 13:45:17,"It's *not* too late to register to vote here, but the early voting period is the **last** chance to register to vote in Durham County for the 2024 election! That's today until 7:30pm, or tomorrow from 8am to 3pm. The Duke Votes student organization has put together [an outstanding set of resources with a detailed rundown!](https://vote.duke.edu/) Here are some quick specifics that will hopefully help if you're not sure where to start:

First, if you're not sure about your registration status, you can [check your status here.](https://vt.ncsbe.gov/reglkup/)

The closest early voting site on campus is at the Karsh Alumni and Visitors Center. [All twelve early voting sites in Durham county](https://durhamnc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=3ba5733d5de645debd6e6089e92c7f32) are open today from 8am to 7:30pm and Saturday from 8am to 3pm.

If you need to register for the first time in Durham County, bring proof of residence with you -- if you live on campus, Duke has already provided the county with your address, so your physical (not mobile) DukeCard or Duke Student Voter ID card is proof enough! Otherwise, a utility bill, bank statement, or [anything else listed here will work as proof of residence.](https://www.ncsbe.gov/registering/how-register/register-person-during-early-voting) You'll also need to bring a form of ID -- a physical DukeCard or Duke Student Voter ID card will also work for this! If you don't have either of these, [these forms of ID will also work](https://www.ncsbe.gov/voting/voter-id#acceptable) \-- and Duke Votes is working to [help make the cards available during early voting.](https://vote.duke.edu/duke-student-voter-id-card/)

You can just show up at an early voting site (again, before Saturday at 3pm) and tell the election worker at the check-in station that you'd like to same-day register and vote. You'll be guided to the help desk, and an election official will guide you through the process. After you're registered, you can immediately turn around and vote!

Consider going today; if something goes wrong, you can go back on Saturday before 3pm and fix it!

Hope this helps!"

Game Experience (Recap from neutral fan),https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/1gbpoly/game_experience_recap_from_neutral_fan/,32,6,2024-10-25 08:47:18,"Apologies if creating a new post instead of adding to [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/1g50pgm/visiting_for_football_game_on_friday_am_i_missing/) from last week is frowned upon, but I wanted to express my gratitude for all the tips in that thread and for the great hospitality I received on my trip. Here's an extremely long recap of my experience and some random observations:

1. I went to the Boston College-Virginia Tech game Thursday night, so I drove over from Blacksburg early Friday morning, arriving around 10am. 

2. My first stop was Monuts. Really neat place that I would visit again for a breakfast sandwich or larger meal if I had more time, but settled for a quick Monuts donut. It hit the spot.

3. Next, I spent about an hour and a half just walking around campus -- from the chapel to Cameron Indoor to Old Chem. The stone and Gothic architecture is stunning in person. In fact, I think the 3 games I attended last weekend (Virginia Tech, Duke, and Maryland) combined for the most beautiful 3-game stretch of campuses I've visited. I also walked through the West Campus Union and wow -- that place is extraordinary for campus dining. The dining halls at my alma mater (Florida) were just a step above high school cafeterias, but that place had a station for every major type of cuisine with an amazing outdoor space to boot. Very impressive.

4. I also spent a good bit of time perusing the basketball museum. As a hoops junkie, the amount of high-level memorabilia was astounding while still being tastefully displayed.

5. Despite the temptation of just dining at the West Campus Union, I decided to head over to 9th Street and check out Dain's Place for lunch. I enjoyed the laid-back vibe and a decent burger, but the tots really highlighted the meal.

6. After lunch, I made an excursion over to Raleigh to check out NC State's Howling Cow Creamery. I know that's off-brand for a Duke trip, but as a self-proclaimed college dairy store ambassador, it was necessary. Also, it was fantastic. I highly recommend stopping by if you're in the area.

7. By the time I got back to Durham from the creamery excursion, it was about 3:30pm, so I stopped by a couple of local breweries: Hi-Wire and Durty Bull. Each had a sparse crowd, so I guess credit to Durham professionals for not being so quick to skip out of work early on Fridays.

8. As I headed back towards campus, I made another stop by Devine's. Really neat place that had a nice mix of Duke folks and visiting FSU fans. It seemed like a place that would be electric in its dive-ness after a big hoops victory.

9. A little after 5pm, I made my way to campus, parked, and explored the tailgating areas. I met some great folks at several different tailgates in the lots along Wannamaker, including the Hard Hat Guys someone had referenced in response to my previous post.

10. To be honest, I didn't come into the game with high expectations about the stadium and in-game experience, but I was pleasantly surprised by both. The layout, amenities, and club areas in the stadium were all well-suited for the size & scope of Wallace Wade and there was a solid night game energy among the folks seated near me. Everyone getting energized by ""Every Time We Touch"" was also a highlight.

11. As a Florida alum, I am legally bound to hate FSU with every fiber of my being. So when Duke held on for the victory, I couldn't resist ... I rushed the field. I thought others would join me, but that didn't matter. The exhilaration of watching my rival fall to 1-6 at the hands of a Duke squad breaking an 0-22 streak against said rival was worth the risk of a police intervention. Fortunately, such an intervention never came and I somehow ended up standing next to the team to sing an alma mater of which I knew zero words, then taking pictures with both Manny Diaz and the Duke mascot on the field. I lived the dream.

12. Since I was heading to Maryland for a game on Saturday, I headed straight from the field to my car and began the nighttime drive to Richmond, where I stayed Friday night. All the while, my mind replayed an incredible night at Wallace Wade that exceeded all expectations.

Overall, I had a fantastic time in Durham. The campus is beautiful, the town has a ton to offer, and the football fan base seems primed for continued growth as the program sees success. Everyone knows -- perhaps a bit too well -- of the passionate fandom associated with Duke basketball, and if that can ever fully carry over to football, it will be exciting to see. I'm rooting to see that come to fruition.

Anyway, sorry for the obnoxiously long post. Again, my sincere thanks to all of y'all for the tips and the hospitality I was shown, as well as the follow-up messages several people sent asking about my trip. I'm sorry I didn't respond to those sooner, but hopefully this lengthy treatise suffices lol.

One last thing: I've been traveling all around the country for games since 2018, but last season I finally caved to my friends' encouragement and have begun sharing some of my travels publicly. So if you'd like to see pics, videos, etc., I've posted a long ""story highlight"" to my Instagram page (@cfbtravelguy), plus several Reels from the game. I also post some videos on TikTok (also @cfbtravelguy) and plan to put together lengthier trip reviews -- basically this post, but in video form with some additional commentary and clips from my trip -- on YouTube (@cfbtravelguy) after the season when I've got some spare time.

I love the place, its gorgeous. However I have an observation.

Whenever I am dealing with people here, be it property managers at leasing offices, insurance agents or in general people around our daily life.

Most of them sounds like a Lawyer, specially the young ones, I feel the lack of empathy in their day to day life.

Example - I have signed a lease agreement with an apartment building here, its a decent building with one year long lease. Overall I would be paying them \~26K USD in an year. We decided a moving date and completed the paperwork.

1. The Agreement was like 50 pages, were I am responsible for everything everywhere.
2. In the whole process, I felt like I am talking to robots. the empathy was kind of dead in the people I dealt with.
3. I had planned for a moving company for early morning move in, they couldn't even make an adjustment to handover the keys a day earlier or early morning.
4. When I requested, instead of listening to what I have to say, she kept on giving a monologue like a Lawyer, that they aren't responsible for this.
5. And this was not part of the legal contract.

I felt the same any many places with people around 18-29 Years age bracket. Everyone talks around like they are talking to machine."

I am a current freshman looking to do some course planning for the spring 2025 semester. I'm probably going to pursue a BS in econ and a BA in public policy. The 2 classes I've locked in for next semester are 1. Writing 101 and 2. PubPol 155 (the gateway course).

I'm considering how to pick my other 2 (or 3, if I overload) classes. I was hoping to get some advice on a few things -

1. after taking Econ 101 this semester, should I take Econ 104 or 201 next semester? Or, since there are 6 core classes to finish by sophomore year, should I take both? Has anyone done both and found it manageable?
2. I'd like to take a math class for my final class. Would Math 202 (multivar) or Sta 199 be more manageable/useful? Pro of 202: it helps with the BS requirements, and I've heard it's not too bad. Pro of 199: it gives me a foundation I don't currently have in R and data packaging, which seems crucial to getting involved with Econ research both at Duke and during internships. The only con of 199 is that while it helps with skills, it does not help with any major requirements for me. The BA in pubpol takes Econ 104 as an equivalent. Thoughts either way from current econ majors would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for any advice you have."

I used to think to myself ""My vote really doesn't matter. There are so many people, one vote will never make a difference."" While I would have a candidate that I would like to see win I would never actively engage in politics, partly because of my inexperience but also partly because I did not care.

However, all of that changed one day when I was in college.  One of my foreign classmates and I were discussing our school project when we got onto the topic of politics. He inquired ""Who are you going to vote for this election?"" I told him that I had no intention of voting in this election. He looked at me with a puzzled look and inquired as to why. I explained to him that I just did not feel my vote made too much of a difference and I really did not think any decision would really affect me. While I told him I had a preference, I also really didn't think it mattered who we elected. He then looked at me and said ""You should be thankful to live in a country where you have the privilege to vote. I wish I could vote in this election but I cannot nor can I back home."" I did not know how to respond to this. How could I argue with someone that my vote does not matter when he has never had the privilege to vote in the first place? After soul searching (and a long awkward silence) I came to the realization that I did not have an answer. This was an eye opening experience and I promised him I would go and register to vote.

I wanted to share this experience to hopefully spur a few of you who are thinking of sitting out this election. Your vote is too important to just sit on the sidelines. There are a lot of people who will be affected by your decision (or indecision) that need you to let your voice be heard. Whether its your foreign friends, your family, or any others who do not have this privilege, they are all looking to you to help shape our future. Do NOT wish you would have done something after the fact, there are no takesy-backsys in politics. Decide who you believe should be the leader of the free world and GO OUT AND VOTE!!!

TL;DR GO VOTE! It matters to more people than you might even be aware of."

With the 2024 election approaching, I wanted to remind everyone how important it is for young people to get out and vote, especially in North Carolina, which is a critical swing state in 2024. Your vote does difference in determining the outcome of this election, and the youth vote could be a game-changer.

~~Unfortunately it is too late to register to vote if you haven't already, but here are some resources:~~   (removed because the website is confusing,  You Can Register at Any Early Voting Location!)

* **Early voting:**¬†Many people don‚Äôt realize you don‚Äôt have to wait until Election Day. Early voting is an easy way to avoid lines and get your voice heard ahead of time.  Early voting ends on November 2nd. [Check Here](https://www.ncsbe.gov/voting/vote-early-person) for more info on early voting.
* **Mail-in voting:**¬†You can request a mail in ballot up until 1 week before the election.  [Check Here](https://votebymail.ncsbe.gov/app/home) for info on how to get a mail in ballot.

There are no excuses to sit this one out‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs voting early, by mail, or on Election Day. Your voice is critical, and we need as many young voters as possible to turn out.

**Want to make it fun?**

I‚Äôve also been working on a project called¬†[Presidential Pick'em](https://presidentialpickem.com/), where you can predict the outcome of the 2024 election by filling out your own electoral map and compete to see who had the best prediction. It‚Äôs a great way to get involved, see what others are thinking, and maybe even challenge your friends! There‚Äôs even a competition [Pool specifically for Duke](https://presidentialpickem.com/view-pool/f25d14bb-c3e0-4dd0-83a5-1edc4794157d) voters.

I'm a Florida-based guy (*not* an FSU fan) who travels all around the country to watch CFB games and take in each school's unique way of experiencing the best sport on the planet. I'm heading to Durham on Friday to check out the game against FSU, which will be the 55th D1 campus I've visited.

I typically compile a pretty in-depth list of things to do around town, places to eat & drink (thanks largely to [this great thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/ie0yck/local_durham_shops_restaurants_you_need_to_know/)), and info about the gameday experience, but if there are any football-specific traditions or any parts of campus that you feel are can't-miss experiences, I would love to hear about them and make sure I don't overlook anything.

I'm also not totally clear what expectations should be for tailgating before a Friday night game, so if you have any info on what areas I should check out to best scope the tailgating scene, that would be greatly appreciated.

Essentially, my goal is to cram as much of the Duke college football experience into one day as I can, so whatever you think may help me accomplish that, feel free to douse me in nostalgia of the places and experiences you loved during your time on campus.

Sorry for the long post. I look forward to hearing any tips y'all may have!"

I'm leaning towards

CS310 (Lentz)
STA (199, stats req)
ENG 101(S, W, ALP reqs)

I'm decent at CS but definitely not as cracked as a lot of CS students here. Just wondering if I'm gonna wreck myself with this schedule?

Some context:
- Ideally 308/310 would be in separate semesters but the way Duke is offering the courses they probably won't be offered again before I graduate. 

- I do have an interest in data science/ml but figured it might be smart to take the easiest stat req possible with 308/310 hence STA199

- I'm stressing about this and probably overthinking it, just don't want to feel like I missed out on learning any essential skills before graduating

It was a passion project that was supposed to forever live on my computer but it proved quite useful for me in the gym. I'm considering marketing the app so I wanted to gauge interests. It's essentially Strong app on steroids (Strong is a workout tracker app). There's an AI coach who's been fed exercise science info from Renaissance Periodization, [Exrx.net](http://Exrx.net), and other popular sources. It can generate workouts for you based on your fitness profile and analyze your inputted workout data. There's also graphs that display volume, rep and set ranges as well as calculators for estimated 1rm and other metrics.

So yeah. Would you guys use this? I know there's a shit load of AI gym apps out there but a lot of them are BS. Like, you can't find your body fat percentage by video scanning your body lol. That's why I modeled the app after Strong which was a hit before AI.

I've always thought area studies could be beefed up more, particularly Asia.

Even smaller schools like Yale have a Council on Southeast Asia Studies, to consolidate resources for a region of 700 million people that Duke just lumps into AMES. Food for thought, anyhow."

The class fulfills a bunch of different graduation requirements: CCI, CZ, EI, and R.

DM me if you're a student and want more info. FWIW, I teach another course called ""Religion and Film"" that is quite popular with athletes, so this class could be a good option if you wanted to take that one but couldn't get in.

Bikes at Duke,https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/1eo6tlo/bikes_at_duke/,2,12,2024-08-09 18:14:11,"Hi there,

I'm a rising freshman and debating whether or not to rent a bike at Duke. 

Could anyone provide some insight as to whether biking is a good alternative to taking the C1? I have only 25 minutes to get from Bivins on East to BioSci on West two days a week this semester, and I'm wondering whether having a bike will make that commute easier than dealing with the rush for the C1. 

Since Duke's campus is somewhat hilly and there's a fair amount of stairs, is it impractical to get a bike? Or is it pretty common?"

waitlisted for every course due to system glitch during course registration,https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/1enoftu/waitlisted_for_every_course_due_to_system_glitch/,10,10,2024-08-09 02:28:36,"I'm an incoming freshman and my enrollment date for courses was today. I was waitlisted for almost every course due to a system glitch and I was wondering if some people had the same experience. (and what to do in this scenario)

  
I camped on the site since 1155, refreshing as soon as the webpage was available so as to get a head-start. At 12 pm sharp, when I refreshed another time, the processing loop appeared and I assumed that I needed to wait a bit so that the system receives my request. I was kinda happy since I was pretty assured that I was early and therefore had the best chances in getting into my courses.

  
However, the loop did NOT disappear for more than an hour. As I was constantly checking on the webpage every few minutes or so, I did not dare to refresh, since I have heard from upperclassmen that 1) the loop can take quite a while (i.e 30  + minutes) to disappear, since there is high volume of traffic during registration, and 2) if you refresh, you might lose all your progress, and that might restart registration again. I thought that my case was just the former and I just needed to be a little patient

  
After 75 minutes, I thought that this cannot continue going like this, and I decided to refresh after talking to an upperclassman. He said that I was probably cooked, since it was extremely unusual, and the chances of me needing to refresh and therefore start registering courses 1 hour and 15 minutes AFTER the opening of the window would be quite high. I heeded his advice and did it.

  
Turned out that I was waitlisted for almost every course, especially because I am a potential Econ and CS major, which is pretty popular. Additionally, I was at probably the tail-end of the waitlists: around 50 for Econ 101 , 30 for CS 201, and 10 for Math 122.

  
Panicking, I called both OIT and Registrar, who were completely unable to help me in their capacity, saying that it was a regrettable incident. I thought that at least they were able to recognize the flaws in the system, but they were adamant on the fact that nothing can be changed and told me to just suck it up. OIT told me that I should be rather responsible since I should have been sharp enough to refresh after a few minutes. Apparently she did not know that refreshing would mean forefeiting all progress during registration and -- being a Freshman -- I thought that waiting rather long times for the loop to disappear was normal.



I understand that such stuff do happen, but when I am on the receiving end of it with personal stakes in the game, it just feels like shit when I am told that nothing can be done. I was even angrier at the attitude of the help desk: instead of recognizing a potential flaw in their system and telling me that this problem would be relayed and discussed, they just kind of swept it under the rug. If this could happen to me, it might have happened, or would happen to many other individuals as well!!! 

Yes, maybe I should have refreshed a couple of times, but I was legitimately scared that if I did that, all progress would have been erased from the system, and I would end up in the same situation as now! 

To improve the situation, I tried to ask them for the record of my registration attempt at 12 pm sharp, so that I could use that as justification when I message the Profs asking for a permission number. Yet, it is precisely because the request was not sent through until 1.15 pm that there were no records on the system of my attempt at 12 pm. So apparently nothing is on my side, and I have to just convince 3 profs for a permission number.

I have messaged the profs and I do not know how they will respond. Given that it's an incident that has not really been taken seriously and the profs would probably face tens of requests during this time period, I feel that I am gonna end up with almost no viable classes this fall semester. Sure, I can have backups, but you don't really consider backup course combinations when almost all your courses that you want to take waitlist you. If I am forced to take some backup classes, I will need to take multiple of those that do not interest me AT ALL, and I honestly do not see how that is going to play out well in the long run.

It has been a pretty shit day to say the least. I almost smashed my laptop and yelled so loud that almost everyone in the hotel can hear me. I have spent more than 48 hours flying since there were multiple delays (american airlines, obvious-fucking-ly) and I am an international student. I haven't slept in roughly 2 days. Now I dont know if I can even have a feasible schedule for fall.

Seeking Advice for Mech E + CS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/1enjkp4/seeking_advice_for_mech_e_cs/,1,2,2024-08-08 22:40:28,"Hi y'all, incoming Pratt freshman here - I have a few questions and was seeking advice to get a little more clarity before I started. 

  
Coming into duke, I'm pretty sure about doing MechE; Among other reasons, I've done a lot of mechanical work/CAD/design in HS robotics and in general, I love to collaborate with others, problem-solve, do math and physics and directly apply them, and work with my hands. ig that's common to many majors, but I'm (as of now) set on doing MechE. In addition, I also really enjoy coding; based on my experiences in classes and some outside experience, programming is very puzzle/problem-solving oriented; it's something I can easily lose track of time doing. Maybe comparatively, I have more ""engineering experience,""  but CS does excite me and I'm curious to learn more, even if it gets to be less about 'coding'/hands-on work and more theoretical/mathematical - but of course, that can change as I continue exploring.



Like any tryhard STEM kid, a part of my decision is job-motivated. The truth is that I can see myself doing a lot: I can see myself sitting at a desk writing code as a SWE, I can see myself working on design and other industry-related engineering roles, doing something that's an intersection of both/robotics-related, but like a lot of others, I'm also intrigued by consulting (sure, $$$, but I also can see myself enjoying it, considering it's pretty problem-solving centric), and other finance stuff. That's a pretty wide range and I'm sure that MechE or CS alone could open a lot of doors, but I'm wondering if both would provide any advantages. I also wonder if CS may be a bit broader in terms of the job market (pretty much every company needs ppl to do cs) compared to MechE. Again, this isn't the biggest decider, as I know that Duke will probably open a lot of doors, and regardless of major, it will take a lot of networking and hard work to get there.

  
So, with all this said, I have some questions for folks doing similar stuff/who were in similar situations:

1. What are people's reasons for deciding to do Mech E + CS? How was the experience? How's the (obviously) rigorous courseload?

2. What fields do MechE + CS folks end up in (ig at duke, it could be anything, but I wonder if there's a trend towards SWE, industry, consulting, etc. or maybe it's truly random)? Does this combo have any advantages over just doing solely MechE? Are there maybe other combinations to consider?

3. When should I decide to pursue this or not? Considering that there aren't a ton of overlapping courses and that I'll need to overload, at what point should I 'commit' to it? Ik that you can declare your major in Pratt 2nd semester freshman year, but I might need more time to explore.

4. CS Major vs Minor: What's the difference, and what are people's experiences?

--

I wanted to end this by saying that I'm really excited for the next four years ahead of me. I'm going forward with an open mind, will try new things, and I'm also aware that my interests and trajectory can/will/might change. My courses this upcoming year will be fairly standard (cs 201, physics e&m, linear and multi, and egr 121 - which I've heard is the first mechE specific course - to list a few), so I hope they'll give me a better idea of the two fields - and I'll def join clubs to get a better idea too.

Sorry for this long post, but I wanted to give as much context. I look forward to hearing y'alls thoughts, experiences, and advice. TIA!"

I am incoming freshman in Trinity and trying to find ways to fulfil the FL requirement. I studied Chinese in HS and got a 5 on the AP exam (Chinese 203 Credit), but that was a while ago and my Chinese is definitely not as sharp as before. I was wondering how Chinese 204 is as a course and whether it is difficult for people who have been out of the language for a while. 

In addition, I am also thinking of maybe starting a new language from scratch, like Hindi or Spanish. This would require me to take 3 FL courses rather than only 2 FL courses in Chinese. I also know these introductory language courses from scratch can be quite an undertaking.

I‚Äôm a rising freshman at Duke and had some questions about the grading system. I come from a different grading system in high school. 4.0=A, 3.0=B, 2.0=C, 1.0=D, etc.

I noticed Duke‚Äôs grading scheme makes it near impossible to get a high GPA as a premed (3.7+) even when factoring in how difficult premed already is. Although, I am aware I am just a freshman and I could very well be putting the cart before the horse.

Do you guys prefer this system? Has it helped with graduate school?

Hardest Majors at Duke?,https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/1ee49a4/hardest_majors_at_duke/,2,5,2024-07-28 10:17:18,"In terms of gpa/course difficulty wise, what would be considered a hard major at Duke?

I've heard that STEM majors like Math, Physics, (and Chem?) are considered difficult, as well as engineering majors like BME. Math, I've read, has some wacky grading policies/curves that make a high gpa difficult, while CS I've heard that there's some grade inflation? And I guess premed majors like biology would be difficult in their own rights.

  
Lastly, I know it's difficult to maintain high gpas off the bat in college but would a \~4.0 gpa be feasible for such ""hard"" majors? I've read that the top 25% gpa at Trinity is like 3.9, but that might not correctly represent the ""harder majors."" Thank you!"

About Me

My name is Owen (he/him). I am 28 and working on my Ph.D. in nuclear engineering. In my free time I am into gardening, beekeeping, tabletop games, and sometimes rock climbing or practicing Mandarin Chinese. I am eager to meet someone who might share in my hobbies or introduce me to another! I enjoy hosting bonfires in the backyard throughout the year to catch up with friends, and would love to have a new roommate become part of that group. We expect no smoking in the house and a roommate who likes to keep their space relatively clean. Someone LGBTQ-friendly is a must. I am interested in living with other grad students or young professionals if possible. Note that if you have a bee allergy, I keep hives in the backyard but have an epipen on hand in case of an emergency.

If you have any questions, want to see photos of the space, or have my contact info to arrange a tour, don't hesitate to DM me."

That being said, I had a couple of questions:

1. What are the requirements like, if any of you are familiar with them, for BME/Math at Duke? I found this link (https://duke.app.box.com/v/bme-undergrad-program-handbook) that states BME majors only need to take 3 additional courses (2 AP credits) for a math double major? That seems like a very small number of courses & especially, very low (course number and difficulty wise) number of math courses. Could this perhaps be the case because BME major courses already compensate for the other math courses required for a standalone math major? Or am I mistaken in my interpretation of this document?

[BME\/Math major additional requirements?](https://preview.redd.it/v4ahdd4z5hed1.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc824be5a8fe857d45bd524cfdd7f4c2e8445cde)

2) Secondly, how hard is the BME major at Duke? I've read that Duke has a fantastic BME program, but I was wondering how the difficulty of the major stands when compared to other majors, especially notoriously difficult ones like Physics, Math (and Chemistry, I've heard). Also, is the workload at Pratt far greater than that of Trinity?

3) Lastly, would it be advised to take Math 221 this freshman fall? I have calc credits + looking to get prematriculation credit for multivariable calc approved. I've read a lot of horror stories about math 221 (and math in general I guess) on reddit so is it a bad decision to start off with 221 as a freshman?

I recently came up with an idea of doing a search engine type of thing for Dance studios only. The idea is that Dance studio is a HUGE market in the US but there is not enough advertisement beyond social media platforms that run by themselves. The same thing that bothers dance enthusiasts is that it‚Äôs really time consuming to find classes that interests them in their surrounding areas because of lack of advertisement. So, with that in mind, the platform we could develop is as simple as a search engine that allows users to search up classes(using keywords or tags) and studios nearby. And for the side of Dance studios, they could register and sell their classes online on their side. Right now it‚Äôs only an idea of mine but the potential profit even if we only take 10percent of the sales on our app could be REALLY insane. If any of you guys are interested in talking about the idea with me please DM.

I am an incoming freshman trying to plan out my classes for taking an Electrical/Computer Engineering and Computer Science double major. However, I am realizing I ultimately want to work in the software industry and would only get the ECE/CS double so that it looked better on job applications

I've also heard that CS is overcrowded and understaffed and that ECE is much more quality...thoughts?

I think that I would probably prefer going further in CS and pursuing my own endeavors instead of doubling in ECE, so I don't know if starting my first semester in Pratt and then transferring out is worth it, or if I should just start in trinity.

My main question is,¬†***is there any significant advantage that being an ECE/CS double-major would give me? Or is it better I focus on CS and have the extra time to simply pursue my intellectual curiosity?***¬†I'd really appreciate insights from folks who were/are in a similar position or folks who are in the industry and can provide insight in retrospect.

Oh, and a lot of people complain about t-reqs, I do have transfer credits and have heard that more will transfer if I stay in Pratt, so I didn't know if ECE/CS would be much more than CS + T-reqs.

I'm an incoming c/o 28 freshman at Duke, and I'm super excited. I'm kind of interested in a lot of things, and I wanted some advice about what classes to take my 1st semester. For context, the Econ 101 class (taught by Prof Nechyba) that I'd like to take is at the same time as Ethics 101 w/Prof Jesse Summers.

Which do you recommend I add to my schedule?

  
Pros of econ 101: it's an unavoidable prereq to take other econ courses, so it would be good to get it out of the way, especially if I end up pursuing an econ degree (like everyone and their mom at Duke, haha; I am very interested in econ atm though!). However, I've read that Prof Nechyba is a great lecturer, and I don't want to miss out if I take the class in the spring or later. Does anyone know if he's likely to teach Econ 101 in Spring 2025 semester as well, or if he alternates with another econ professor?

  
Pros of ethics 101: it feels right up my alley, a nice, cozy philosophical seminar. I have a feeling I'd really enjoy the discussions and content of this course. Again, I don't know if I could potentially take this spring semester or if this is my only chance. Can anyone share whether Professor Summers is engaging/friendly/a good teacher?

I'm deciding between signing up for chem 101 or chem 99 this fall. I took AP chem my junior year and got a 3 on the exam without really studying much but I barely remember anything about it tbh. And I'm super scared about getting a B my first semester. Would taking 99 be kinda detrimental to my schedule as a premed since it would hold me back a semester? Would it be worth taking (i.e., does it provide a helpful foundation b4 taking 101) anyway? How difficult is it to get an A in chem 101? If u could go back in time, would u take chem 101 or chem 99?

Very detailed inquiry as to whether I should do the MESS Focus,https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/1d6cd6o/very_detailed_inquiry_as_to_whether_i_should_do/,1,7,2024-06-02 12:37:04,"Hi y'all, I know there have been 1 billion and 1 questions about focus, but this time I have a very detailed question, so hopefully I can get some specific advice.

So I am currently accepted in the Modeling in Economics and Social Sciences focus, and at first I was very excited about it, but now I'm wondering if it is worth it.

So, for context, I am an undecided major, but am currently considering being a Public Policy major with a Statistic minor, and while I'm skeptical about econ, I'm willing to try and see if I like it. Given this, I feel like it should be a decently good fit. I've also taken AP Stat and Calc BC and got a 5 on both so I feel like the coursework should be manageable. I've asked a few seniors I know about MESS and focus generally, and they seem to recommend it as good for finding your place freshman year. As someone who finds it a bit overwhelming in a huge group but is pretty social in small groups I feel like focus is a good place to make friends. Also, people seem to think the professors are pretty good for life/networking/etc. and I'm not afraid to talk to teachers so would it be worth it?

HOWEVER there are a few problems.

1. I'm pretty sure the focus programs don't count for pretty much any major requirements right? So is it still worth it?
2. While I plan on being pub-pol rn, I still want to explore other options such as something STEM like environmental science, or English, or Asian American studies, etc. So now I'm wondering if it's worth it because it does seem like Focus takes away two precious courses that could be used for exploring something new or diving deeper into something I know I like. Also, I want to study abroad in Europe, so I feel like I need to get a head start on my language requirement. Unfortunately, I will have to take the full three years.

TL;DR: the MESS focus sounds like it fits my interested but at the same time I'm very worried it will severely limit my first year classes as I am undecided and want to take a LOT of intro classes. I'm looking for advice about focus, but if you have other advice relating to my situation like being undecided or planning freshman year I would love to hear it"

Does NOT doing FOCUS ruin your Freshman experience?!,https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/1cy0y1a/does_not_doing_focus_ruin_your_freshman_experience/,5,15,2024-05-22 14:00:04,"Hi y'all, incoming freshman here. Since my acceptance I've had this goal in my head that I should take advantage of each and every opportunity that Duke has to offer and try to do all of the main programs.

I've been looking at the Focus clusters for weeks now trying to convince myself that I MUST do one but honestly none of them seriously interest me or fit in with the goals I have in mind for freshman year. I feel really conflicted as Duke really emphasizes their Focus program but I just don't find any of the classes offered in each cluster interesting and/or I don't meet some of the prerec requirements needed for one of the clusters I'm somewhat interested in (Modeling in Economic and Social Sciences). I kind of feel like not doing Focus and having the flexibility to choose all of my classes the first semester would serve me better in terms of my freshman experience...but I'm uncertain.

Big question, does NOT doing Focus break/ruin your Freshman experience?! Is it waste to not do Focus even if it doesn't 100% interest me? Will I regret the decision to not do Focus? Everyone seems to be doing Focus and I just don't want to miss out on any opportunities that could positively impact my academic journey. Any advice?"

Japanese vs French at Duke,https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/1cvk89o/japanese_vs_french_at_duke/,6,18,2024-05-19 09:16:54,"Hi everyone,

So... long story short I need another foreign language for Duke. I studied Chinese in high school, but I'm a heritage speaker and I've already passed the HSK6 so I don't really feel like studying it officially, as I have plenty of immersion. I'm currently torn between Japanese and French for my foreign language. So the thing with Japanese is that I've taken roughly a year of it already, and based on the placement info I would be able to do at least 102 or maybe 201, while I have learned no French. Japanese is also to my advantage because I can read Chinese so most of the time I know/can guess the meaning of most Kanji. However, I've had the opportunity to spend roughly half a year in Japan and I gotta say... it's not for me. So I'm not sure how useful/how urgently I need to learn the language. Also, when I looked at the staff names it seems that most of them are Chinese which isn't a deal breaker, but I'm wondering if native speakers would be better.

On the other hand, I would really like to study/work in Europe after I graduate, and I also plan on working in the public policy/nonprofit/academia route so I think maybe French would be better for that? Or if you recommend another language I would be happy to look into it, I just think French is the most popular after English. 

  
TLDR; how much do y'all recommend the Japanese or French courses at Duke? What are the workload/study abroad options like? Thanks in advance."

I'm filling out my housing application and could use some advice from alumni or current students. There are several questions related to preferences on substance use and same-gender neighbors, and I'm unsure how to answer them.

I don't drink and don't plan on drinking, but I've heard that the non-substance dorms can be pretty boring. Can anyone share their experiences with this? Are the non-substance dorms really that different in terms of social life and activities?

Additionally, there are questions about having same-gender neighbors. How does that work in practice, and what are the dynamics of an all-boys dorm as compared to an all-gender one?

My main concern is that I'm not sure how much I might change during college. I want to experience the full Duke social scene, including parties, but I'm unsure how these housing choices might affect that.

Any insights or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

I had booked a lovely four-bedroom Airbnb for my family for graduation weekend, but due to some unexpected changes in plans, I no longer need it. I figured someone else might be able to make use of it, since accommodations can be hard to find this weekend!

The Airbnb is an entire detached house, Eno Valley, spacious, well-equipped, and in a great location for anyone attending graduation festivities. It can accommodate up to eight people.

If you or anyone you know might be interested, please shoot me a message. I'm happy to recoup some costs and transfer the reservation over to someone who needs it.

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions!"
Thoughts on CS 255,https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/1cni12o/thoughts_on_cs_255/,1,2,2024-05-08 22:55:42,"I‚Äôm thinking of doing the BS in CS and want to take at least one social science elective. I‚Äôm debating between CS 240 (Race, Gender, and Computing) and CS 255 (Introduction to Cyber Policy).

I‚Äôve heard that CS 240 is more of an easy A. While I‚Äôm more interested in cyber policy, my main goal from this requirement is a gpa boost for the major, and I‚Äôll gladly take which ever class is easier.

What are your thoughts on CS 255? Is it relatively the same difficulty/workload as CS 240? Or is one more chill than the other. I‚Äôll be overloading with other classes during the semester I‚Äôll be taking one of these classes.

P.S. I have a bit of cyber policy knowledge from beforehand (very limited) but don‚Äôt really know much about cybersecurity."

so if duke was in charlotte NC i would‚Äôve clicked that commit letter immediately when i got accepted, but i just don‚Äôt want to stay on campus and occasionally go to 9th street every few days, i want to venture out and go beyond the campus unlike most of the current duke population. oh and i also want to record music as a hobby so is there any recording studios at duke/durham?

has anyone here been able to get out of the duke bubble and venture out and still feel they have access to a city type of vibe? or am i the only one facing this dilemma"

The *Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies*, hosted at Duke, still requires mail delivery of a printed manuscript.

So a costly event for a statistically likely rejection.

I am looking for a kind soul to print the document from PDF and drop it off on the third floor of Trent Hall. The file has 59 pages, because this journal also requires double spaced Courier font with 1.25"" margins. I don't make the rules; I'm a trivial adjunct instructor caught in the crushing gears of twenty-first-century academia.

I'll gladly cover any cost of printing (do you get free printing?) + a cup of coffee via Venmo. Bonus, if for whatever inexplicable reason you also like thinking about medieval manuscripts, you get a fun unpublished essay in PDF form. And of course my undying gratitude.

I applied with little hope, and miraculously got in. Prior to my application, we checked the Net Price Calculator and was projected to receive about $48,000 in Duke grants for financial aid. When my financial letter arrived, I was surprised to see that I received no financial assistance. Literally a 0 for Duke grants and scholarships. So, I set up a financial meeting with a financial officer and was instructed to submit the Special Circumstances appeal form. After a multi-paged explanation and about 15 additional documents provided, we sent it to Duke on Monday. Today, I received my financial appeal and was informed that I do not qualify for need-based assistance. I literally have no idea what to do. It seems like a complete misinterpretation of our financial situation because of the information I will provide below. I plan to setup another meeting with a financial officer, but I‚Äôm genuinely flabbergasted that they are providing no assistance based on my circumstances. Is anyone else experiencing a similar situation?

Some important notes:
- I am expected to pay over half of my parents‚Äô income for Duke BEFORE taxes. 
- I am expected to pay over 3/4 of my parents‚Äô income for Duke AFTER taxes. 
- My brother already attends an ivy ‚Äî so a four-year full time enrolled university.

Do you guys work full time or have multiple part time jobs?  And how are you not burnt out from doing both????

For context, i was admitted to the Meng Climate and Sustainable Enigeering program, with a decent scholarship so i‚Äôm looking forward to attending. part-time is not an option because of the scholarship requirements but also I don‚Äôt wanna be in school forever.  currently I work in industry with a remote job that is a little bit more flexible than most. Although it is mentally demanding, there is some flexibility in the hours

I really don‚Äôt want to quit my job because I love what I do and I like the security of working so I have a few options I am considering for my first semester. I also work in utility scale solar, currently, which directly relates to what I am pursuing the masters for. i would be more comfortable taking a campus position in the spring given that I could use the fall to save and get ahead on rent.   I also plan on taking the ‚Äúlighter‚Äù courses in the fall.

1. keep working full-time, but switch my hours from 7 to 3. I like this option I don‚Äôt want to be completely out burnt out. Do a lot of grad students work full-time??

2. save my PTO through August. We have a nice amount of PTO and by August I will have enough PTO to take off one day every week so I would be working 32 hours but still getting full-time pay with allocate me in an extra day to focus on grad school, my job is an extremely healthy environment so I don‚Äôt think that ask would be frowned upon, especially because I am taking courses that will help me at my job. I also consider just asking to switch to 32 hours but I feel like using my pto  is likely to be approved, because this is time I‚Äôm already allocated for. I also have separate sick time so if I need anything else, I will have a couple extra cushion days.

3. Take a leave absence and try to do something less demanding. I really don‚Äôt want to do this. TA pay is around 2k a month from what i heard and that‚Äôs about a 1/3 of what i bring in now. I really would like to consider this option for the spring.


other relevant info: 

- I have a decent savings, but not enough to get me through grad school by far. I will be more open to using my savings for the second semester because I know that I would not have to completely drain it to study  

- I don‚Äôt have a lot of obligations. no kids no husband just me n my doggie.  I don‚Äôt want to take out loans to support myself because I already will need to do that for the tuition that is not covered by the scholarship

- I‚Äôm first gen I am not entirely clear on the structure of a masters, especially masters of engineering where I will not have a research project. If anyone has any insight on the masters of engineering programs at Duke, please let me know my program is new this year so there‚Äôs already limited info.

- no my family cannot help or support me. Currently I do a lot of supporting in my family, so if i stop working i won‚Äôt be able to help

- i‚Äôm not open to onlyfans‚Ä¶well maybe‚Ä¶


Any advice or insight would be AMAZING. Also, I have been in communication with my manager but because I don‚Äôt have a course schedule or specifically no what I‚Äôm going to do I can‚Äôt put in a formal request. also it is above my bosses head so he can‚Äôt do anything for me really besides give me advice. My job is amazing and the people I work with are really caring and understanding but as my boss put it at the end of the day, it is a business. I think my case will be stronger because the masters will help me at work and a lot of people I work with already have their masters. I‚Äôm also not looking for any type of tuition reimbursement so I think that is a plus as well.

I recently got admitted to Duke (looking to major in BME) and wanted some insight from current/past students for each. Here are the factors I'm looking to consider (from least to most important):

1. Location: I'm someone who prefers the sun! I also have a cousin at UNC and a close friend in Raleigh. Most importantly, I would prefer having safety on and near campus (this is the main thing I haven't been able to find a consensus on). 
2. Community: I'm wondering whether or not the people in the BME programs are super competitive and cutthroat or more supportive + is it easy to make good friends? I've also heard about Duke's hierarchies and elitism but am not sure if that is super impactful. 
3. Work-Life Balance: I want to have a good work-life balance in college since I wasn't able to in high school (including things like sports games, social life, etc.). HOWEVER, to clarify, I don't necessarily want a hardcore party school but again one that allows for a good balance. This also includes things like whether the BME workload is so heavy that it completely interferes with social life. I'm also planning on doing the 4+1 Program at Duke to earn a Master's degree along with a Bachelor's. 
4. Specific Research/Course/Internship Opportunities (10): For context, I'm interested in the tissue/cell engineering and cancer research side of BME and want to go to a college that will allow me to explore those fields in courses, labs, and internships. I know Duke has elective courses within BME and hospital systems. Also is it easy to join BME clubs, labs, etc? In terms of rankings, both Duke is in the top 2 for undergraduate BME but I wanted to consider how the program will suit my interests in and beyond college.

Please let me know if you have any advice and thanks so much :)"
