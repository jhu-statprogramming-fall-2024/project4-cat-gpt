If possible, the teacher should submit the evaluation form along with their letter of recommendation, but all that is officially required is the recommendation letter.""

NIH Undergraduate Scholarship Program,https://www.reddit.com/r/Emory/comments/1gmaq53/nih_undergraduate_scholarship_program/,8,2,2024-11-08 04:50:54,"**Are you an undergraduate student who is interested in biomedical, behavioral or social science research being conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)?**

  
**Do you qualify as demonstrating exceptional financial need (i.e., low income)?**

*...then the NIH Undergraduate Scholarship Program (NIH UGSP) might be for you!* 

  
Emory has been a top scholar-producer for this program in the last decade. I won it when I was in college, someone I knew in the Class of 2014 also won it while we were attending, and recently a [Class of 2024 graduate](https://news.emory.edu/stories/2023/02/er_nih_scholarship_21-02-2023/story.html) won the scholarship. 

The scholarship is pretty freakin' great. The benefits include:

\- Up to $20,000 in scholarship money per year (can be renewed)

>AND  
  
For every year of scholarship support, scholars commit to two paid service obligations in the NIH Intramural Research Program. These are:

>\- A ten week full-time summer internship at the NIH immediately following the year of scholarship support

>\- One year of full-time work at the NIH post-graduation; this service obligation may be deferred until completion of an advanced degree program.

So, when I was at Emory, I won it and renewed ($40,000 of scholarship monies) + 2 summer internships at NIH's campus + 2 years of post-graduation job support working in a lab on NIH's campus. It's a pretty big deal! 

If you're interested in applying, feel free to AMA in this thread. I'd love to get visibility for this program because there are a lot of strong science students on campus that would be successful in the program.

Emory was my dream school in high school and I applied ED but got rejected and decided to give this school some time before even thinking of transferring. I have about a 3.65 gpa here (historically harsh grading school) and still some moderately good SAT scores from high school, plus I've already fulfilled a lot of requirements. My main concerns are social. How hard is it to make friends as a junior transfer? Would it be weird to rush a fraternity? Any insight would be great.

Recently I’ve been reflecting on the mentors I’ve had throughout undergrad and med school. They really played an integral role in getting me this far, and I am trying to pay it forward myself and provide guidance to younger students on the same path.

I’ve had different mentors for different areas of my professional life (classes, research, extracurriculars..) but they’ve mostly shared a few great traits:

 -  They’re accessible and available. A good mentor makes time for you, whether it’s regular meetings or even a quick email check-in. You shouldn’t feel like you’re chasing them down.

 - You want a mentor who’s walked the walk, but it’s even better when they acknowledge that they don’t know everything. A great mentor is willing to share their mistakes and humbly admits when they’re learning too.

-  They give it to you straight but in a constructive way. You need that tough love to grow, but it should always come from a place of kindness, in a way that builds you up, not tears you down.

 

Do you know of any more qualities you think a mentor should have? Please lmk!

 So, I wanted to compile a list of helpful “insider” and underrated tips that I’ve heard in the past for when I get ready for residency interviews myself.

 -   For both pre-med/med students, I’ve heard knowing and “practicing” your story is key. The interview may have a natural conversational flow, but rehearsing prior to the interview will make sure you’re not stumbling at the “tell me about yourself” question. I hear that one’s the hardest.

- Classic tried and true – do mock interviews, especially prior to interviews for the schools or programs you’ve got your eyes really set on. This will relieve a lot of the anxiety come interview day.

- For med students, practice scenarios with tough patient interactions and ethically charged questions. It may not be the exact same scenario on interview day, but it will teach you to think on your feet.

This is for those looking to attend the Fred Again concert in Atlanta, Georgia, on October 9th, 2024. The concert will take place at the State Farm Arena, around 15 minutes from the Emory campus. 

I bought these 2 tickets at a crazy reasonable price, considering the limited seating arrangements left on TicketMaster. This is for the third row (CC) of section 108, which is my top section (I like this view the most). Unfortunately, I had to cancel due to work, so I wanted to drop these tickets here since the deal was so good compared to what’s left. I hope someone can make good use of purchasing these and enjoy this concert. I wish I could’ve gone!

They didn’t disclose any pay info for the position (expected hourly rate, salary range, etc.), and also required applicants to enter their expected salary. The latter is an ethically dubious practice (asking applicants for expected salary without disclosing a ballpark range) but unfortunately still common, so I wasn’t shocked by that. But the former is widely considered a discriminatory employment tactic, as it leverages and perpetuates gender/racial pay gaps (essentially if you were underpaid at your last position, you’ll likely be underpaid going forward), and it’s *outright illegal* in many states now for employers to request this info (let alone require it). 

I’ve never been asked this while applying for a job. I understand it’s not illegal for private employers in GA to ask (although it is now illegal for city agencies in ATL to ask). But, is this standard practice for jobs at Emory, or a weird fluke?

Stayed in Dobbs and then stayed in Woodies. Holy hell, it was the most soul sucking hellish experience of my life. No matter what I did or where I went I couldn’t shake this feeling of low level anxiety. Everything kind of felt like fake, like I was in a play or something. 

The social aspect was horrible. Classes were tense and people were not friendly or easy going. It was like just below the surface everyone was struggling inside. Nobody talked in classes and there was this crazy tenseness in the air. 

The classes had too much work. The campus was weirdly ugly a lot. The clubs were career step stones and popularity contests. The frats and sororities seemed also like image oppressed and soul dead. 

I was also coming off of a hard time and going through a lot of stuff in my family life. However the black and white difference between being in Athens now and at the Emory campus is insane. There are people in Athens that seem like they can genuinely breathe deeply, talk sincerely, and relax their shoulders! and they might like their life 🤯

Emory also just felt so scammy. Why was everything so expensive?? And so crap?? It was like not a single person on staff had any passion or zest for their job, because everything the admin would do felt politically correct and angled for a good reputation. 

Emory is a clear example of the money-making side of higher education. It does not offer the  college experience I dreamed for of freedom, exploration, growth. It was really the opposite of that. 

Honestly, the student body felt like they were still in high school. Everybody dressing carefully, talking correctly, and judging like it was a full time job. 

Something is not right about Emory! If you had a bad semester, and then another bad semester, and then another bad semester… you should leave. You are not crazy for not adjusting to a place like Emory, you are human.


Personally it’s not that I don’t care about the Emory diploma, it’s that I actively don’t want it. I would hate to have that as a symbol of four years of my life i was willing to exchange for a piece of paper with mild academic clout. Don’t let them pull the hood over your eyes and convince you this diploma does absolutely anything significant for you. I know too many people that are actually alive and stress-free going to other public colleges that will be 100% living a better quality of life then the poor abused graduates of Emory. It’s really not about the school name, especially when the education experience itself is soo soul crushing.

How to read the clock tower,https://www.reddit.com/r/Emory/comments/1fcygh1/how_to_read_the_clock_tower/,49,7,2024-09-09 19:43:18,"After about a week of analysis, I have figured it out.

The bell only calls out the hour, or the minute. Never both at the same time. To call out the hour, the bell will play 4 sets of 4 (so 16 rings total) to announce itself, then will be struck slowly a number of times that directly corresponds to the hour. For 5PM it will be struck 5 times, 4PM 4 times, and so on. 

So 3pm would sound like - 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔, 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔, 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔, 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔. 🔔  - 🔔 -  🔔.  

To call out minutes, the bell plays one set of four to call out 15 minutes, three sets of four to call out 45 minutes, and to call out thirty minutes, strangely, two sets of four will be played, then an additional slow strike is played. So:

x:15 - 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔

x:30 - 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔, 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔, 🔔 

x:45 - 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔, 🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔,  🔔 🔔 🔔 🔔

Why they add the extra strike to thirty minutes, I do not know. I also do not know when the bell begins striking, but I know it ends at 12AM, thankfully.

I find this whole system terribly inefficient, as clearly you should never have to strike the bell 28 times simply to call out that it's 12pm/am. The bell could simply be struck six times for 6pm/12am, five times for 5pm/10pm, four times for 4p/8p, and so on. "

I’m looking for someone to take over my furnished 1B1B lease at Campus Crossings Briarcliff, available after October 1! It’s in a really nice part of the apartment complex that’s far enough from the street so that it’s nice and quiet with trees outside the window (it’s beautiful in the fall!). The complex has lots of really nice benefits (right next to Kroger, on an Emory shuttle route, gym, pool) and the apartment itself is really spacious and convenient with an in-unit washer/dryer.

Another really nice thing about this apartment is that if you're working in the general Emory area, you don't need a car (or at least I personally have not) - I have lived here for over two years and worked at Emory and haven't had or personally wanted or needed a car. Having a grocery store steps away and a gym/pool in the complex has been really convenient.

For more information about the program and how to apply, please read on or [visit the DRP website](https://math.emory.edu/~drp/). 

The DRP is a program run by graduate students in the math department which pairs motivated undergraduates with graduate student mentors to learn a topic in a one-on-one setting. If you're interested in learning a topic not offered regularly in the course format while getting to know an Emory graduate student and gaining insight about their experiences, this program might be for you! The topics offered vary depending on student interest and mentor availability. [Past topic descriptions](https://math.emory.edu/~drp/files/Past_Sample_Topics.pdf) and [brand new topics](https://math.emory.edu/~drp/files/New_Sample_Topics.pdf) can be found on the webpage.

One course credit will be offered for participation, assuming you aren’t at the credit limit! DRP courses follow a reading course format, with students meeting with their mentor once per week for an hour to discuss what they learned, ask and answer questions, and work on problems together. At the conclusion of the semester, students will present what they learned to an audience of their peers.

I am an incoming transfer student and I am really conflicted about whether to choose emory or not and for these reasons so please give me your ideas if you can! 

1. I was selected to be an ra in my old school so my bill would be very cheap (which is good considering i’m an intl student and my family doesn’t make much). 
But in emory i would pay 2000 more than what i have been paying for the past semesters in my school (the original cost, not the ra cost btw) 

2. Emory is a prestigious school which I believe would help me to get into further schooling which i want to do and also getting a job. 
My previous school is not that highly ranked and is a very small libs art school. 

3. Emory was such a reach for me since I was a terrible student in hs and I worked really hard to get accepted, which makes me happy. 

4. Emory has not transferred my credit yet and I would be basically doing a whole major again (i’m a junior transfer) i can do it but it will be really tight. i need to take 20 classes in my 2 years for the major + some of the other emory req like languages and stuff.

I have already taken AP stats and AP precalc (which really isn't a AP math), which I'm hoping makes me seem like a well-rounded student. However, I have a feeling that if I take BC I would struggle with the course since the current teacher doesn't seem that good.

Looking at the subreddit, the Dual Degree program is criticized a lot as many see it as not being worth it especially considering it tends to take 5-6 years.

Hello everyone, I am an incoming Freshman in the Atlanta Campus majoring in Biology under the Pre-Med path. If you can answer any of my questions, I will deeply appreciate it

1: I currently have the credit for math 112Z from AP, do I have to take any more math classes to graduate?

2: Is it possible for me to take more classes when it says term unit exceed?

3: Are those classes only for fall term? Would I start taking higher level classes in the spring? When can I register for those classes?

4: Am I already enrolled in those course? If I am not, should I create a secondary shopping list in case some classes are full, to spare time from adding and deleting classes

5: What are some tips to adapting, thriving, and making friends in the campus? 

Thank you so much! I really appreciate the time and effort you put in answering my questions"

To sum it up, I'm worried about 1. which language to take, 2. spacing out nursing requirements 3. Trying to avoid burnout so if my schedule is too rigorous/not rigorous enough and how many classes per day/spacing. Thank you so much!

Hello! I am heading to Emory this fall and was wondering if you would take some time and give me some feedback on my semester one schedule. I am aspiring to obtain a BBA from Emory and made sure to include some prerequisites for the course; as well as some general requirements!

  
I kinda felt weird having no classes on monday, but let me know if thats a problem or not. (When building this schedule, it was actually quite difficult to find classes that worked on Monday for me)

  
Also I had some questions on how BUS 290 works. I understand it's an online class, but would someone be able to fill me on how the class actually operates?

Preparing for my first year has been quite challenging so far. Aside from my college advisor at the city library, I haven't had much support or connections with anyone who attends a school like Emory. I believe my acceptance to Emory was largely due to strong letters of recs, a decent GPA, and my involvement in social justice work. Despite graduating as valedictorian, it was from a low-income high school in my city. I've never passed an AP exam, and my ACT scores are low, which are the only metrics I have to compare myself with other students who were accepted. I apologize for sharing this somewhat embarrassing pitiful story, but my concern is that I might not be academically prepared or capable enough for Emory—whether it's my vocabulary, academic background, or ability to keep up.

Every day, I wrestle with whether leaving my family and city for a better education and future is the right decision. I would greatly appreciate any tips or advice you could offer on how to catch up academically and fit in at Emory.

I have couple questions about the program and hope current or former students could help me answer: 
-What’s the exam and homework frequency for each semester? Do you have at least one exam per week? I was having weekly exams before and it was really hard for me to get adapted to it. 
-Does your cohort have 80 people? Is the attrition rate okay? 
-Do you usually have two full days in classroom and two days clinical? 
-May I ask your stats when you applied to the program? 
I completed all prerequisites, bachelor degree, optional personal statement and resume. I graduated from a college in NJ and have 3.8 cumulative gpa, Human Resources major and Bio minor, one C+ in physio and other classes are B or above (mostly A), 3300 patient care hours as medical assistant in multiple specialties and 330 volunteer hours. I applied the Emory PA program before and got rejected quickly so I’m afraid if my 3.4 science gpa and C+ in physio would affect my application negatively.

Two years ago I came on here as a incoming freshman asking for guidance with this exact plan and if it was doable and a good few said no 😂 but I appreciate those who did believe I could do it and gave me tips with pairing certain classes together 

Of course since I’m considered apart of the Emory gold plan and everyone since fall 23 is on the blue plan, the GERs might be a lil different. And the pre med requirement side of the chart is flexible depending on the med schools but I did it based on a list of like 30 I was interested in at the time and some Emory recs

I’ve now finished all of the pre-med requirements and nursing requirements (kept up my gpa too), kept a social life, starting the nursing school in August, and have started MCAT studying to wrap up content review by then. So here it is, it is possible. Everything was done within the school year except last summer I took physics one and two through domestic transient study and this summer to get the two language classes out of the way I just finished a 5 week study abroad. 

The schedule picture is old and not updated since fall 23 was when I took that extra English class but that’s everything 

I would even say it’s possible to get a 4.0 if you stay committed. I didn’t get a 4.0 because I enjoyed my very large fair share of a socializing and last minute studying😂 but I still got well above the needed 3.0 for nursing school automatic admit. "

Whistler apartment ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Emory/comments/1d81lkb/whistler_apartment/,1,2,2024-06-04 16:35:23,"Hey! I was debating if I should stay at the Whistler with my friends. It’s far from Emory. I have a car, and cost is not an issue. Let me know if you have any opinions or experiences of commuting from midtown to Emory. I believe that there is a GT bus and Emory bus that has a stop near the Whistler and takes me to Emory. BTW I’m transferring as a sophomore to Emory, and I believe that housing is not guaranteed for transfer sophomores and there is a bad history of giving on campus housing spots for transfer.

I am in between these (and BBA+QSS but leaning toward the two in the title). I am planning to pursue management/strategy consulting, not SWE, but i feel like CS is more marketable. However I feel like I may get a better GPA in math. I don’t really care for programming, i don’t hate it but i don’t like it tbh but I am ok at it. a lot of CS classes (Foundations of CS, ML, etc.) feel much more math oriented which I would like. I also noticed a lot of people saying BBA is better for consulting but McKinsey is one of the top 5 employers for econ majors so I don’t know how much I believe this.

Also as a side note it looks like based on the 5 year outcomes the econ-math people do worse than trad econ majors but i’m guessing that’s because most go to grad school and it’s a much smaller sample size.

I have to pick my major in the next 15 days so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Emory vs USC Pre-Med,https://www.reddit.com/r/Emory/comments/1d5tfs9/emory_vs_usc_premed/,5,3,2024-06-01 18:28:40,"

Hi! I’m trying to decide between the two schools. I’m on the pre-med track, majoring in neuroscience. I’ve lived in northern California my whole life but my current institution is in socal(i’m transferring into my sophomore year).

 I really liked USC’s campus and culture, but I haven’t been able to visit Emory. I know Emory is ranked higher and places well for medical school in the east coast, but not sure about the social scene. I really like the NBB program and the research opportunities at Emory medical school and surrounding locations. I have always been interested in going out of state, but don’t want to risk giving up a social life or a fun culture. I’ve also never been to Atlanta so any insight would be nice! 

I would rush at Emory but probably not at USC because of what i’ve heard about the toxic greek life culture. Full pay for both schools. 

Is Emory significantly better than USC for med, and can I enjoy the school culture or should I just grind it out at USC? "

I had an amazing social life there but I always felt like I wasn't surrounded by people who were pushing me to work harder or helping me grow intellectually.  
  
One of the main reasons why I want to attend a top university is because I want to be around people who are much smarter and more hardworking than me so that I get to learn as much as possible from them. I believe CMU offers me a better environment than what I've experienced at Emory.

I'm aware of the hustle culture at CMU, and frankly, excited about it as well. The entrepreneurial and innovative culture at Emory also seems inferior to CMU's.

However, I'm on track to graduate from Emory in 3 years while at CMU I'll start at freshman standing (unaware of how many credits transfer over yet) and will probably take 6-12 months more to graduate than I would've at Emory. Is the extra cost and time worth it? (I'll probably pursue Business, Economics, Entrepreneurship/AI at CMU)"

If transfer is not an option, what could be some good options I have, should I stack up all the workload to do a BBA+AMS(AMS might be able to prepare me for being a quant, but then the only reason for doing BBA would just be the networking and career center).

I'm coming in already with some college experience from dual enrollment (30 credits), but I took online classes and have only sat for one in person exam. I've also never taken finals at my HS and only taken 2 APs (bombed one, aced the other) so I've had a ""light"" courseload since 11th grade.

That being said, what advice could you give me prepping for Emory? I (hopefully) won't be taking the required freshman math or writing classes thanks to dual enrollment but everything else I have to take. I already took an intro class for my major via dual enrollment, but I might have to retake it at Emory.

I’m gearing up for Organic Chemistry 1, and I’m feeling pretty anxious despite my solid preparation in General Chemistry 1 and 2 (courses 150 and 202). Here’s what my study routine typically looks like:

* Completing class worksheets and practice problems.
* Attending sessions held by Learning Assistants.
* Going to office hours and asking questions.
* Regularly reviewing Learning Objectives.
* While doing practice problems, I always ask myself: ""What is the main idea? What do they want me to understand?""

Even though I eventually get the right answers with this approach, I still struggle with practice exams and often second-guess my intuition during actual exams (even though I’ve learned that trusting my gut tends to be the right move).

**My question is:** Despite doing all of the above to prepare, does anyone have additional study methods or tips that could help? Have any of you experienced similar challenges, and how did you overcome them? Any advice on how to improve my exam performance would be greatly appreciated!

  
P.S I also didn't do the greatest in 150 but I improved in 202 and believe I understand the material pretty good since my test scores improved but still were not great (self doubt) and I had a better prof"

3. How is the social scene, especially as a transfer? I don't mind if the social scene is less steered towards partying, but I'm worried that I'm going to be super lonely in general with no friends 😭 especially since all of the '27 students know each other already.

I swung by the protests on the Quad the other day, and hey, I'm sympathetic to protecting the lives of innocent civilians. But all I heard were chanted slogans that lacked nuance or depth, and while I generally prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt that they're decent people, I worry that 

a) reasonable protests might be easily disregarded by people who in the absence of clarity assume the worst, and 

b) protesters with positions I oppose might in the absence of clarity assume that everyone agrees with them, pushing them to become more radical.

In short, what I really want is some protesters to hold up a sign that says, ""Hamas did evil things, and we want them out of power, but we want to minimize civilian casualties, and while we acknowledge the need of Israel to defend itself from further attacks, we think that the Israeli military uses excessive force in many cases, and that this disregards the rights of Palestinians and indeed perpetuates a cycle of violence that will end up getting more people in both populations killed unnecessarily.""

I know that doesn't roll off the tongue like, ""There is only one solution, Intifada Revolution"" (which I heard on the Quad) but, well, \*that\* slogan sounds a lot like you're referencing the Final Solution (Nazis enacting the Holocaust to kill millions of Jewish people) and the violent uprisings of the previous Intifadas. It sure \*invites\* people to assume you're cool with violence.

And sure, I know 'intifada' literally just means uprising, and doesn't necessarily mean 'we support killing Israelis' -- and I'm conscious of how there are some parallels to how protesters who said 'Black Lives Matter' got accused falsely of being anti-white racists -- but c'mon guys. You're smart students. You've gotta understand what your words signify to those listening. There's a reason that police accountability advocates generally have moved away from using 'Defund the Police' as a slogan.

So yeah, I . . . I just want to have the protesters link me to some readings that articulate their positions in depth. I want to see folks clearly saying, ""We're anti-Hamas, and we want the hostages returned safely. We just \*also\* think that Palestinian lives are just as valuable as any other lives, and want to protect them.""

Is that out there and I've just not seen it? Because if it is out there, yo, share it with me, and I'll amplify it. 

I want to save lives, and advocate for non-violent resolutions whenever possible. But I would feel more comfortable if I was cooperating with people who are clear on their stances."

Sorry if this is not the right sub to post this, but I'm currently trying to make a really tough decision between Emory and UW Madison because deadlines are approaching. For context, I'm a first-gen, low-income Asian American student from a pretty isolated island  and I'm planning on majoring in environmental science or something related. I'm very grateful that I've received a generous amount of aid from Emory, however, it still leaves me having to pay around 12k (out of pocket) which is still quite a lot for us. My parents are telling me they're willing to help me pay for it, but I'm worried that the amount of aid I recieve might change over the years.

As for UW Madison, I've been given a full ride for four years and I'm incredibly grateful for it. However, my only concerns are the large class sizes and lack of diversity, though it has good school spirits and programs for my major. Emory has great resources and overall support, plus smaller classrooms, but I've heard that the social scenes are pretty dead. I would like to have a well-rounded college experience while pursuing my studies, though it's not really a dealbreaker for me. I'm not too worried about the weather and I'm still not sure whether or not I'll pursue grad school in the future. 

I'd really value input from anyone at Emory, especially if you've had to weigh financial considerations as part of your decision. How have you found support as first-gen Asian American students? Is the social scene really as dead as they say? How safe is the area around campus? And if anyone is from a similar background or has made a similar transition, hearing your experiences would be extremely helpful.

Dear Emory Community,

Early this morning, several dozen protestors entered our Atlanta campus and   set up an encampment on the Quad. These individuals are largely not   affiliated with Emory and were disrupting the university as our students   finish classes and prepare for finals. This is completely unacceptable. In   response to this encampment, the Emory Police Department notified these   individuals that they were trespassing. When they refused to leave, law   enforcement cleared the Quad.

I ask each of you to use judgment and show compassion for everyone with whom   you share this community. It is essential that we preserve an atmosphere of   respect on our campuses at all times.

We will provide additional updates moving forward.

Sincerely,

Gregory   L. Fenves

Dear Emory Community,

I’m writing to share further information about the events that took place on our Atlanta campus earlier today and the actions taken by the Emory Police Department (EPD).

At 7:41 a.m. a few dozen protestors arrived on campus. When they arrived, these individuals ignored and pushed past EPD officers stationed on the Quad and set up tents in an area where equipment and materials were staged for Commencement. Based on their actions and refusal to confirm their connection to Emory, EPD made the assessment that these individuals were not Emory community members. Officers with the Atlanta Police Department and Georgia State Patrol were then called to provide further assistance. Around this time, several social media accounts announced a protest and occupation of the Quad and issued a public call for non-Emory community members to join them.

EPD issued multiple warnings at different intervals advising individuals in the encampment that they were trespassing on private property and instructing them to leave. When those requests were ignored, Atlanta Police and Georgia State Patrol officers assisted EPD with dispersing the crowd and taking individuals into custody for criminal trespass.

During this process and the subsequent confrontations, objects were thrown at police officers. To our knowledge at this time, an individual attacked a non-EPD officer and appears to have been tased. Video of this incident has been widely shared on social media. Based on current information, this individual is not a member of the Emory community. Due to the direct assault of officers, law enforcement released chemical irritants into the ground to assist with crowd control.

As of this message, we have been notified that 28 individuals have been arrested, including 20 Emory community members, some of whom have been released. We are working with responding agencies to expedite the release of any Emory community members who remain in custody.

Our primary goal today was clearing the Quad of a disruptive encampment while holding individuals accountable to the law.

Sincerely,

Cheryl Elliott  
Emory University Vice President for Public Safety

Dear Emory Community,

I’m writing to follow up on yesterday’s messages regarding the protests at   Emory.

The encampment that was set up yesterday in the early morning on the Quad in   front of the Commencement stage was quickly cleared by law enforcement and a   number of arrests were made. Following these events, students gathered   outside Convocation Hall to organize a protest. Throughout the afternoon,   Emory students and community members assembled peacefully on the Quad. The   afternoon events were monitored by open expression observers and Emory Police   Department (EPD) officers were on site to provide support as needed.

Early yesterday evening, a large group of protestors left the Quad and   gathered outside the Candler School of Theology. Some protestors pinned   police officers against the building’s glass doors, threw objects at them,   and attempted to gain access to the building. These actions against officers   prompted an increased law enforcement presence on campus. Protestors then   returned to the Quad and eventually dispersed. No further arrests were made.

I am saddened by what took place at Emory yesterday. To watch these highly   organized, outside protestors arrive on campus in vans, construct an   encampment, and overtake the Quad just days after it was vandalized with   hateful and threatening messages was deeply disturbing. I also know that some   of the videos are shocking, and I am horrified that members of our community   had to experience and witness such interactions. The fact that members of our   community were arrested upsets me even more and is something that I take very   seriously. To the best of our ability, we are working with law enforcement   agencies to assist detained community members and expedite their release.

Yesterday’s events echo similar incidents that have taken place at   universities nationwide. I understand that the ongoing effects of the war in   Israel and Gaza, including the humanitarian crisis engulfing the Palestinian   people and the hostage crisis involving Israeli civilians, continue to stir   painful emotions. At the same time, the construction of the Atlanta Public   Safety Training Center engenders fierce debate across our city.

As Emory community members continue to express themselves and protest, we are   committed to working with students and faculty, open expression observers,   and the EPD to facilitate their peaceful expression. However, we will not   tolerate vandalism, violence, or any attempt to disrupt our campus through   the construction of encampments. These actions are counter to our values, and   they disrupt the core purpose of the university and its educational and   research missions.

Today, once again, Emory staff from Facilities Management have returned to   the Quad to repair the damage caused by a group of individuals who did not   have this community’s best interests in mind. Dedicated staff members will   then resume the work of preparing our facilities as we welcome thousands of   families, parents, and guests to campus for our Commencement ceremonies.

As we approach finals, the end of the academic year, and Commencement, I   recognize that there is disagreement on difficult issues and there will   continue to be debate. But I also know we can express our views and beliefs   without diminishing the experiences and accomplishments of others. That will   be our challenge in the days ahead and I know it is one that this community   will rise to meet.

Sincerely,

Gregory   L. Fenves  
President

Dear Emory Community,  
   
On Friday and again yesterday, hundreds of students and faculty assembled peacefully on our Atlanta campus for student-led protests. Our open expression team worked closely with the student organizers of the events to facilitate their peaceful expression, and that partnership worked as it is supposed to.

That changed last night.

Late in the evening, as students and faculty were assembled on the Quad, several individuals rapidly approached Convocation Hall and spray-painted hateful messages on the building’s exterior walls. Several other structures were also vandalized. These individuals brazenly disrupted what had been a peaceful protest. Many on the Quad, including those participating in the protest, condemned the action as the work of individuals from outside our community. Last night’s incidents follow similar vandalism that occurred on the Quad last Monday. The Emory Police Department is coordinating with other law enforcement agencies to investigate these crimes.

With the events of this week, it has become clear: Emory is navigating a divide between individuals who wish to express themselves peacefully and those who seek to use our campus as a platform to promote discord. Incidents like this—perpetrated by those who aim to disrupt and divide us—must be rejected and condemned at Emory.

This is a distinctly emotional and challenging time. We continue to gather the facts so that we can update you on the steps we are taking to address this week’s events. As we engage in important conversations about how we move forward, we must not allow hatred to overwhelm the many peaceful and thoughtful voices at Emory.

I am dedicated to keeping this campus safe as community members finish classes, continue their research, sit for exams, and prepare for Commencement.  
  
Sincerely,

Gregory   L. Fenves  
President

Dear Emory Community,

Over the past week, Emory has experienced unprecedented protests and disruptions. We are not alone. Nationwide, universities are grappling with events that have deeply shaken our respective communities. I have heard from many of you, and I want you to know that I am listening. I understand your concerns, your fears, your frustrations, and your outrage. As we enter the final week of the academic year, I am focused on protecting our campuses, supporting peaceful expression for all members of our community, and finding ways to foster healing and rebuild trust.

I would like to use this message to update you on last Thursday’s events.

Based on the information we had early Thursday morning, we determined that the individuals who constructed the encampment on our Quad were not members of our community. It is clear to us now that this information was not fully accurate, and I apologize for that mischaracterization. My goal was to remove a growing encampment, as allowing such an encampment would have been highly disruptive, affecting everything from classes and exams to our ability to hold Commencement. I remain firm that such encampments cannot be permitted at Emory.

Let me be clear: I am devastated that members of our community were caught up in law enforcement activity enforcing the removal of the encampment. The videos of these interactions are deeply distressing. I take Thursday’s events very seriously and we are launching a thorough review of them so that we can develop recommendations to improve how we keep our community safe. This review will include how Emory engages external law enforcement agencies.

I am committed to supporting our students and faculty who wish to express their views peacefully. We will not tolerate conduct that undermines these efforts. I know that many members of our community are focused on their classes, research, exams, and upcoming graduation. We are working hard to keep our campus as free from disruption as possible so that these important core functions of the university can carry forward at the highest level.

This update shares information about two incidents that occurred on Sunday as well as the steps Emory is taking to address community safety.

On Sunday, April 28, the Emory Police Department (EPD) issued criminal trespass warnings to six individuals suspected of committing recent acts of vandalism on campus. This information was released by EPD that day, and EPD confirmed that none of these individuals are affiliated with Emory.

Separately, EPD shared this evening the following statement regarding an arrest later that day:

*The Emory Police Department Tuesday announced the arrest of a convicted felon who crossed state lines to come to campus.*

*EPD arrested Derek Zika, from Statesville, North Carolina, on the Emory Quad Sunday afternoon. He was carrying knives and an Oleoresin Capsicum spray (pepper spray) canister.*  
  
*He was charged with criminal trespass, obstructing a law enforcement officer, possession of a weapon in a school safety zone, criminal trespass and crossing state lines with weapons, intoxicants or drugs. He was transported to the Dekalb County Jail.*  
  
*Police obtained a search warrant and inspected Zika’s vehicle Monday evening. Inside the vehicle police found an axe, a hatchet and two knives in a bag with survival gear.*

*Emory Police Chief Burt Buchtinec thanks community members who alerted the department to the individual being on campus.*

We understand that this information comes at a sensitive time. It is our responsibility to communicate the facts that impact community safety as they become available.

We have in place or are taking the following measures to further enhance the safety of our community:

* We have added more lighting and additional cameras covering key campus locations. These cameras are monitored 24/7 by the Emory Police Department.

* We have increased officer patrols, the visibility of uniformed officers on campus, and other security measures. These efforts are especially focused on the Quad and are extended to the broader campus.

* We have limited building entry to individuals with card access.

* We are working with individual students who have needs related to exams and other academic accommodations.

Emory is continuously working to take appropriate measures to keep our community safe. We depend on a strong collaboration between EPD and other law enforcement agencies. We support their efforts to assist in keeping Emory safe.  
  
We know that potential adverse impacts to Emory Commencement are a shared concern for many members of our community. We look forward to celebrating the Class of 2024 at Commencement and will share details of any necessary changes in future communications."

I plan on attending Emory this fall, aiming to major in finance with a minor in Chinese or Spanish, and I am wondering what I need to be doing now to ensure success for my freshmen year. I have a couple goals in mind, however the largest is to maintain a 4.0 GPA. What do I do now, and mostly over the summer, so I can make this possible?

I understand a 4.0 is incredibly difficult to achieve. My high school gpa was decent, however, I understand college is a different thing all together. I have to be strategic about this, as I’m not a super genius by any standards. I need information on what classes to take, how to study, how to actually retain knowledge, etc.. More-so, I have to know what Emory is expecting from me (I’m not particularly good at math, so this gave me some anxiety; that’s why I’m asking. Also, I need to learn how to get good at math, a separate thing all together).

I see some other post here, and incoming freshmen are making their schedules, and I feel like I’m falling behind (this happened to me freshmen year of high school, my background led to me having no information on how to succeed in school, that’s why I want to ensure that I’m not ignorant to this valuable knowledge as a first-year).

Feel free to ask me anything and to give me as much advice as possible!

The Many Problems with the REAL Program (Rollins),https://www.reddit.com/r/Emory/comments/1c82nxq/the_many_problems_with_the_real_program_rollins/,6,2,2024-04-19 17:28:43,"Hey masters students! I have been thinking about the REAL program a lot recently, and even though I am a REAL recipient, I have decided that the program is actually really bad for Rollins students as a whole. Here's a few reason why:

**1. It limits the value of our labor.** We are masters students in one of the most prestigious public health schools in the country, yet the REAL program only values our labor at $7.50 cents an hour for the organizations we work for. This is only 25 cents above the minimum wage. Even though the University matches that pay so we get $15 an hour, this is still the minimum wage for many U.S. cities. Our wage also doesn't consider any previous research experience we have, or even what discipline we're working in (research, consulting, etc.), so there is no nuance in the wages that we earn.

**2. $15 is not enough to live on.** Druid Hills/Decatur is an extremely expensive area to live in, and this wage is not livable. I got paid more as an undergraduate research assistant ($18) in a city where I could find apartments for cheaper. I have two roommates, and my entire income from my REAL position still goes straight to rent. Everyone I know pays more rent than me, yet this is still the case.

**3. There is no opportunity for a raise.** The REAL program prevents people from getting a raise, no matter how good the work they do is. In my undergraduate work study job, I was given a raise because I provided value for my team. In a REAL position, this isn't an option, even if your PI/advisor wanted it to be.

**4. It makes it difficult for people without REAL to find a paying job.** I have several friends who do not have a paying job because every employer wants a REAL student. It makes sense for them, because they only have to pay us about half what they would have a to pay a non-REAL student. However, it creates a system where REAL students are underpaid and non-REAL students are not paid at all while attending school at an expensive program in a place with expensive rent. It is quite financially devastating for many involved.

**5. Grants would be better.** I wish there were more merit scholarships rather than grant funding used like this. Since about 50% of the student body is in the REAL program, it is quite expensive for Rollins, and I wish it would be used to just give grants to us instead. Let organizations pay their employees fairly rather than offering limited financial aid to the students who are attending the program.

These are just my top 5 reasons for why I don't like the REAL program. Other reasons could be not giving a chance for people from other Atlanta-based graduate schools, etc. etc. I hope you all consider these when doing your evaluation of the REAL program yourselves (which I just got an email about today), so our voices can be heard about this issue. I would also love to hear your opinions about the REAL program, and if there are benefits I may not be seeing or other detriments I may have missed."

International Student

6 years of experience as a trader (Fixed-Income and FX in EM)

Co-Founder of an agribusiness project as a side hustle (still in developing process, therefore no income perceived at the moment.

Desired goals post-MBA is working for a Asset Management firm, as a Portfolio Manager (I understand this role will take longer to achieve, so I see this as a medium term goal)

Own savings only amount to cover part of my living expenses, therefore, I must undergo into a substantial debt to cover the rest (tuition and housing).

——————————————

The thing is that I have several offers from a couple of schools but the main contenders are Emory Goizueta school of business (22.5% scholarship) and Mendoza College of Business (70% scholarship).

The main reason weighing on my decision is obviously the financial Aid. To me a 70% at South Bend looks very enticing, but my truly first choice is Emory. I just like the community and the opportunities a city as Atlanta has to offers in comparison with South Bend at Indiana (Not to mention their rankings difference)

Having said this, I would love to hear about your honest opinion, what would you recomended me to do If you were on my shoes? Bear in mind that I’m pursuing a STEM designation on both places so I’m only able to payback my loans in 3 years until I go back to my home country.

How hard is joining Oxford Investment Management Group in spring and then Goizueta Investment Banking Club?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Emory/comments/1c056oh/how_hard_is_joining_oxford_investment_management/,1,4,2024-04-09 22:23:57,"I was admitted to Oxford as a spring admit for January 2025, but I'm rlly interested in finance + investment banking. Therefore, I was wondering, what is the acceptance rate for OIMG during the spring? I heard it's kinda hard and they do reject a ton of people, but can anyone quantity that? How much interest and competition is there for recruiting @ Ox?

They say on google that freshmen do not need ANY finance knowledge at all to join OIMG, but does that inflate the acceptance rate? Realistically, what should I study up on to have the best shot? Would finishing financial accounting + macro/microeconomics back in high school help me? Do I need to have an excellent rationate for why finance or are they looking more at skills/aptitude?

Also, how hard is GIBC to join? Do I need to grind IB technicals (e.g BIWS 400, Pearl/Rosenbaum) before joining, and can I even join as an Oxford sophomore not even in the business school yet, or is it limited to current GBS kids?

Btw, is it worth beginning IB networking as soon as I hit campus in the start of 2nd sem or do I have the luxury of waiting till beginning of sophomore year? Any tips on getting regional boutique internships for freshman summer? Do I need BIWS 400 knowledge to get them or do I just cold call em up and they teach me everything on-the-job?"

I am trying to decide what my better option is, first McGill, its 45,000 dollars a year US and I LOVE Montreal, it seem like it has the best social life, and a great international reputation, my concerns are that first it really sucks at econ, ranked 147th globally and also that it is really underfunded meaning that getting labs and research opportunities from what I heard is pretty hard, also I feel like undergrad  support would be pretty nonexsstant.

  
Emory is ranked highest out of what the schools I got into across the board, I am really attracted to the smaller classes that Oxford offers and I think it would be a great stepping off point if I decide law isn't for me, I love the warm weather. My concerns are that I start spring semester, I don't really know what that means as far as academics go, I feel like if I take some intro courses at a local communities college obviously I wont be fully caght up but I should be able to graduate on time, I am also really concerned with the social implications associated with skipping first semester and I haven't really heard great things about Atlanta but I have never been.

As for Northeastern its ranked lowest out of what I got into but I would love starting with a year in London and I am also originally from Bosotn so I appreciate the closeness to home. I think the Buisnes administration and law degree seems super interesting and Co-ops look amazing. as far as social life goes I don't know too much but boston is a great city so Im sure it will be fine.

I am trying to decide between UVA, Emory, and Rotman Commerce at UToronto. I was hoping to pursue a degree in business, and I wanted some advice/takes on which school I should chose.

**Context:**

- I am a dual citizen (Canada & USA) so I pay significantly less to go to UToronto (\~20,000 USD / year)

- I am a Virginia resident so I pay significantly less to go to UVA (\~30,000 which turns to \~40,000 if I matriculate into McIntire)

- I would be paying full ticket price to Emory as of now, but I believe that I will receive aid from FAFSA (\~88,000 ticket price)

- I am in a position where I would be able to afford Emory ticket price (luckily)

**My priorities**

1. A good business program, very good US employment opportunities post grad (IB or consulting), possibility for flexibility/double major in my program (so I can do some science with business).
2. value of the education (is the ticket price of Emory worth the opportunities presented in a smaller, private school?)
3. Location/vibe (atlanta vs. charlottesville vs. toronto)

I am an incoming freshman. Recently I had the opportunity to tour Emory, and while it was fantastic, I didn't get the chance to delve deeper into its advising system. I've got a few questions:

1. How frequently does a typical student meet with their advisor?

2. Are students encouraged to reach out to advisors proactively? (Call or text anytime?) 

3. For current Emory students, what's the most valuable aspect of your advisor's support?

4. Does your advisor offer personalized course suggestions or a 'one-size-fits-all' approach? For example, if a pre-med student seeks guidance on course selection, research project direction, or internships/jobs, does the advisor take the time for individual one-on-one discussions?

Thanks! "
