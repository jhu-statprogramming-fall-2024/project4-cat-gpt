1. People don‚Äôt really like to move around you/look up from their phone when walking. Its like they just intentionally run in to you and just go about their day

2. Related to 1, everyone looks really mean when they walk around. I mean, i look mean too but that shouldn‚Äôt disqualify someone from getting an answer back when you say hi right????

3. It is EXTREMELY hard to get closer to people. Im capable of making friends but making a deeper connection almost feels impossible.

4. These buildings are so cool, jester feels like a small mall, same with the student center. 

5. I feel like im being perceived almost 100% of the time im here. 

6. There‚Äôs always something going on and i wanna go to these things but im always doing them alone, theres gotta be an org or something that has groups of people go to these events and stuff right??? 

Besides that, UT‚Äôs been a great experience and has some of the most brightest minds ive ever met. This school really feels ‚Äústate of the art‚Äù and im worried im not meeting enough people while here to get that experience out of everything. "

Any advice on q-dropping ochem or keeping for a C grade?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1gvbton/any_advice_on_qdropping_ochem_or_keeping_for_a_c/,1,0,2024-11-19 23:52:35,"Hi all. Coming on here as a sort of last resort since all advising seems to be booked until later this week.

I plan to talk to my professor today as well, but i still wanted to post this on here just in case it could be of some help. To sum it up, l'm having trouble deciding whether I should q-drop ochem or if I should stick it out and risk getting a C- C. For context, I do already have one q-drop, and it was for a non-science course during my freshman year (l'm a junior right now).

Cons of sticking with it/not dropping: As of right now, my GPA is on the lower 3.9 side, and getting a C would definitely tank my GPA down to a ~3.6. It would for sure tank my science GPA lower than l'd like. Also, I'm sure I could achieve a better grade on the upcoming midterm compared to my exam average right now, but I really don't know about the final. As much as I want to believe I can get a 90 or above, i feel as though given the amount of info there is to study, l'Il end up getting far lower realistically. TIdr - it's just a bit of a gamble and even with a C, my GPA wouldn't be the best. (I've seen pass/fail as an option as well on the HPO website, but I'm personally not too sure how that'll look for PA/med school applications.)

Pros of not dropping: I wouldn't have to suffer through the class a second time especially while taking other harder pre-health pre-regs like anatomy/physio/microbio. It also would keep my status as a full time student (as of right now I'm taking 14 hours, so dropping ochem would put me at 11 / part-time status). I don't receive financial aid of any sorts, so the part-time status wouldn't impact that much in regards to aid. I just don't really know if having part-time would look good for future applications or if it's something PA/med schools care about which is why i'm hesitant.

Overall, if anyone has gone through a similar experience and has any advice they can share, id love to hear it. I could use all the help/perspectives I can get. Thank you so much in advance."

When I went to talk to a professor, he sort of kicked me out for doubting the material and yelling at me for the entire time so i don‚Äôt believe i defended myself properly. TA agreed with me that was an incorrect information on the review slides, and can‚Äôt blame one who studied (memorized the formula) the study material directly given from professor. 

I could‚Äôve derived that formula by taking derivative but I decided to memorize 2 extra formulas instead just because i didn‚Äôt wanna make mistake during the exam. 

TA told me that he would go talk to him agian but there is a high chance of not getting anything changed. I do feel really unfair for this situation, where I studied the study material and get question wrong from the formula that was indicated.

We had originally intended for our other classmates to sign up and talk about their projects and have also contacted/partnered with a student organization that focuses on racial equality and community, but both have shown **more interest in attending rather than participating**.

If you want to show up or participate (I'll include the sign up for presentations at the end of the post) it'll be **Wed 12/04/2024 from 5-8pm at SZB 5.624**. Anyone is welcome to show up and watch, but if you want to present on a topic/historical event related race/medicine/incarceration that would be SO helpful. It could be as simple as just talking about something for 5 min or as complicated as a 15-ish min powerpoint presentation with visuals etc. Some topics could include the first black physicians, the doctor riots of 1788, medical injustice in the prison system or prison sentencing, or really anything about those topics. Maybe modern day racial injustice, prison/jail injustice, medical malpractice, related history at UT Austin ... you get the point. 

If you feel passionately about **uplifting voices that have been silenced** throughout history such as racial minorities, incarcerated peoples and those with medical complications etc please please please consider attending or participating in my research showcase.

Why is UT Austin ranked so high in Computer Science when UT Austin doesn't perform well in programming competitions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1guj3zi/why_is_ut_austin_ranked_so_high_in_computer/,0,38,2024-11-18 23:37:21,"The ICPC is the largest and most objective college programming competition. UT Austin recently placed 109th in the 48th ICPC World Finals, which is an improvement from previous years when UT Austin didn't qualify. 

[https://cphof.org/standings/icpc/2024](https://cphof.org/standings/icpc/2024)

However, this isn't supposed to be the performance of a top ranked CS school, considering the amount of unknown universities that performed significantly better:

15th - University of Zagreb (Croatia)

17th - Universidad de Buenos Aires (Argentina)

23rd - Sharif University of Technology (Iran)

33rd - Applied Science Private University (Jordan)

56th - University of Dhaka (Bangladesh)

60th - Cairo University (Egypt)

70th - Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (Bangladesh)

What surprised me even more is that there is an entire directory on UT Austin's CS website dedicated to the ICPC: [https://www.cs.utexas.edu/\~utpc/ICPC.html](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~utpc/ICPC.html)

From what I‚Äôve gathered, the main way to train basketball here at UT is by forming an IM team on your own, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be an official basketball club. I didn‚Äôt have time for an IM team this semester, as I was pretty busy early on, but I‚Äôm still really interested in training with a group of motivated players.

I‚Äôm hoping to find a group of students who want to train at a higher level, without the commitment or schedule restrictions that come with an IM team. Ideally, I‚Äôm looking for players who already have a solid understanding of the game (dribbling, shooting, passing, etc.)‚ÄîI'm not necessarily looking for beginners.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking:

* Running drills (shooting, ball-handling, etc.)
* Scrimmages and game-like situations
* Coordinating basketball/agility-focused workouts
* Running and practicing complex plays, such as:
   * Off-ball movement, pick-and-roll
   * Sets like SOB & BOB plays
   * Full-court press, motion offense, etc.

To avoid disrupting normal pickup games, I think the best option would be to meet in the mornings when we can get an entire court to ourselves.

**TL;DR**  
I want to organize a group of players who are serious about improving their skills and want to train year-round, but without the commitment of an IM team. Who‚Äôs interested?

Let me know if you‚Äôre down! If there's enough interest, I will create a groupme and reply with the invite link in this post."

As an external transfer student, I just found out I was admitted as a Government major a few days ago with the intent to ultimately study law, and now I'm left with finding a place to stay for the upcoming Spring semester. I had always intended to live nearby off-campus, as I'm starting my journey at UT as a Junior and I've heard how difficult it is to find on-campus housing for non-freshman students. 

My core requirements for housing are for it to exist on or close to a bus route (25 minutes or less bus ride), for me to have my own bedroom, and for my personal rent to be \~700/month when assuming there are roommates ‚Äî hopefully, that's not a tall order. Keep in mind, that I'm not well-versed in apartment prices, so if this is even feasible, I'm not entirely sure. For instance, Riverside apartments look like a decent fit, but how would I go about finding an equally befitting roommate to split costs? I'm also unaware of the colloquial standings each part of Austin has and their respective apartments, outside of hearing about ""6th Street"", so any warnings or rumors with rhyme or reason are welcome.

Are there any websites that UT students visit to find nearby housing and suitable roommates? Perhaps, I could even find one via Reddit? Any form of housing advice is welcome, as I'm a complete novice at this!

Ineligibility for Math Double Major Despite 86% Math Degree Completion,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1gqny5w/ineligibility_for_math_double_major_despite_86/,4,4,2024-11-13 21:22:12,"I will try and explain the whole situation as clearly as I can for everyone but since I feel the need to be pedantic and extra, at least half of it will be mostly me venting about the situation.

I am a 2nd year mechanical engineering student and I want to add a double major in mathematics. As such, I reached out to CNS and their team specifically regarding double major. During this meeting, an issue arose regarding my total credit hours, a requirement/eligibility thing. I have been told that I exceeded the total credit hours limit, making me ineligible to even apply. Now I want to elaborate a bit on the total credit hours, from asking around, total credit hours refers exactly to the ""total hours credit"" on the registration information sheet to which I have 110. Now the 110 that I have can be broken down into 69 from ""UT hours passed"" and the remaining 41 from hours transferred.

Regarding the hours transferred they are from when I took an English course over this past summer for general education requirements, the community college that I took the course sends over the transcript which is expected to show that I took an English course at their college and the transcript included all my AP scores which double counted over the ones that I already claimed here under ""UT hours passed"". Essentially, I classify as a senior in credit hours while in my 2nd year here at UT and I managed to make my AP courses ""count twice"" in my total credit hours.

Mainly, I want to vent a bit because it just seems plain ridiculous that the CNS requirements are oddly restrictive considering how all other colleges do not have the 90 total hour credit cap and I am reaching out here on Reddit to see if anyone knows any possible thing that I can do since from my perspective, I have no options for double major since I can't exactly appeal according to their requirements. There is no major difference between me with and without these hours aside from a single course so why does CNS feel the need to essentially punish me for having too much AP credits?

Now I can already feel the preemptive comments and that's what the rest of this post will be so I will try answer some already since I know they will show up. 

**Why do you feel the need to get another degree and mathematics at that when you should be only focusing on your single engineering degree since it's hard enough as is?**

The main reasons why I want the degree is part self-satisfaction of just having another degree (yes I am an asshole/engineering student I need some validation) and because I want to explore abstract math topics like topology and algebraic structures compared to applied topics in PDEs, numerical methods, and stochastic processes. Topics related to my major or not is mostly not relevant to me.

**You do know that the value of this math degree in the job market will be close to useless so why you care so much about it?**

Yes, I am very much aware of this fact, especially with engineering jobs since they mostly, if not all only care whether or not you have an engineering degree or not the decision weighting whether you get the job is networking, work experience, and technical skills.

**Why not just self-study on your own time, take the actual math classes anyways as a non-math major, or audit them?**

Currently, this is probably the end situation for me as I have no means of applying for the math major. I also partially answer in the first question but comment if more needed elaboration.

**Won't these additional math courses and degree requirements take extra time for you to finish graduating in 4 years?**

For specifics, for me, a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics requires 5 additional math classes outside my degree plan and the way the engineering degree is set, it is very manageable to do so. If needed, as a last resort, I always have the option of taking any of them over the summer but again unlikely because of summer internships. 

**Will these courses make any of your remaining semesters here over 17 hours?**

No, I made multiple degree plans with or without my expected courses here since inevitably, something will go wrong in registration, and my most credit hour heavy semester will be 15/16 hours. 

**There is an advanced mathematics certificate that you can go for instead, why not go and try out for that?**

Funnily enough, going for the Advanced Mathematics certificate is more difficult logistically and course wise to get compared to getting the actual math degree because these courses are for one, much harder to get as a non-math major and 2, are just generally harder/different mathematics courses.

However, my registration time is very late, and all of Telang's 316 classes are already waitlisted, leaving my only option for prof as Orshansky.

  
I've read online that there's a lot of self-studying for the class because it's very hard to follow his lectures, and that people have mixed opinions about the labs. I am able to handle 302 and 306 right now but am likely only going to be getting A- in both classes.

At the same time, I've heard there are benefits in applying to internships and in being able to take tech electives earlier in sophomore year as a result of taking 316 now, which is what is drawing me to the idea.

What's the cost of living (rent, utilities, etc.)? I'm married and my partner will be moving with me. Is the postdoc salary sufficient for two people (till such time my partner can find a job as well atleast). 

What's the net tax rate and post-tax salary typically? A Google search gives me varying different estimates between 12% to 30%. Is health insurance/social security also deducted from the paycheck?

I'm mainly worried if the monthly take home income will be reasonably enough (I know this is very subjective) to have a decent life as a couple. We're not too outdoorsy / eat out every week. Of course we enjoy the occasional movie/dining out. 

Also, is a car mandatory for getting around in Austin?

ME spring sophomore schedule,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1gni7lk/me_spring_sophomore_schedule/,2,2,2024-11-09 19:45:26,"This semester, I'm not doing good at all in thermo or statics and I somehow managed to do really bad with my Vapa ( thinking about dropping, but need to take it here due to flag).

I'm thinking about possibly instead of taking the regular four next semester : M427 L, solids, dynamics, and the ME318M mat lab class, maybe pushing either solids or dynamics, and taking it at community college ( I saw there is an equivalent class but I am not sure if it‚Äôs even allowed). Then adding communications and possibly retaking a super light Vapa.

I thought about it to lighten the course load and raise my GPA next semester while adding comms I‚Äôve been pushing, but I don't want to get behind either and don‚Äôt know if taking solids or dynamics outside UT is unheard off.

What do y‚Äôall recommend and is there anyone who didn‚Äôt take solids and dynamics together?"

From what I‚Äôve read, it‚Äôs obvious that Gheith is the better lecturer, but I also know that there are fewer resources available to students, and many ratings claim that you must rely on friend networks if you don‚Äôt understand the material and to complete projects. 

This is particularly concerning to me, since I usually get lost during CS lectures (like 429), and I often have to rewatch the lecture or review the lecture slides to get a good understanding of the material. Furthermore, I don‚Äôt have very many people that I talk to in CS (basically none), and so I‚Äôve done every programming assignment alone and studied for exams alone as well. 

Which professor should I take? Any advice/feedback would be greatly appreciated. "

I hate my GRG professor even more after he said this in class last week...,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1gklhrx/i_hate_my_grg_professor_even_more_after_he_said/,45,23,2024-11-06 00:10:45,"Last week, I think it was Tuesday, this professor started off the class by saying, ""The worst decision this university has made is giving y'all a week off for Thanksgiving."" First of all, what the actual F? The whole class was dead silent when he said this. I didn't look around to see other people's expressions, but I know DAMN WELL he saw my sour ass expression. 

He then proceeded to say, ""I know y'all are just going to forget everything I've taught you when you go home."" Like, okay, yeah, that's true? But why would you state the obvious?

He concluded by saying, ""Please take y'all's notebooks home and STUDY!!!""

He could've just told us to take our notebooks home and study, but instead, he decided to be a party pooper and say we don't need Thanksgiving break. Yes, it's important (and preferable) not to forget every single thing you've learned since August, but he really didn't have to drop that bomb on us. Just tell us to study a bit like any other normal freaking teacher.

In fact, I want to be a teacher once I graduate and I would never say what he said to my students, regardless of the age group.

Maybe I'm just biased and crazy. I love the Winter holidays, especially Thanksgiving. This is my first year, and I really miss my family as well as my boyfriend.  I don't know if college students build up an immunity towards the end-of-the-year burnout, but I sure as Hell have that right now.

And yes, I'm aware that we basically get a month off of school for the actual winter break, but still. I don't think I can make it until mid-December without another break in between Labor Day and Christmas.

(BTW this guy only has exams and attendance points, I don't know how I'm going to get a good grade in this class)"

I don't have a car, but I'm fine with walking maybe 20 minutes to my classes, or biking there. My budget range is currently between $1000 to $1100, but the absolute max I'd be willing to go would be $1200.

Is this even possible, or should I just resort to getting a random roommate? Can anybody share their experiences in that case? I'd prefer a private bedroom, and a studio apartment, but if there's really nothing as cheap as what I'm talking about then I'm fine with a random roommate, I suppose.

I'm doing decently well here (3.6 ish GPA) but I honestly don't like the city of Austin, or the broadness of the coursework. I would much rather focus on health topics than discuss plants and animals in my courses.

I am in my 2nd year of undergrad and recently applied to a BS in Medical Sciences (2 yr program) at UT Health Science Center in San Antonio (a city I love). I feel I have a decent chance at acceptance and their PA program is my top choice. I would have the same graduation date, and am planning to take a gap year either way.

**From a program and job acceptance perspective, is leaving UT Austin worth it? Does it really matter what University I get my bachelors from?**

*Pros of Transferring: More medically focused curriculum, lower cost of living and tuition, more specific networking with PA program of interest, clinical practicum element included in curriculum, I'd live in the same city as my boyfriend of 3 years.*

*Cons of Transferring: Less prestige? Losing the Longhorn Alumni Network, Possibly losing pre-req course rigor, loss of research opportunities.*

I ask the girl next to me where we are going and she says, ‚Äúdallas!‚Äù And I tell her my situation. And she goes oh yeah that bus ended up leaving earlier than scheduled and this one is leaving 20 min late. 

So now I‚Äôm thinking I showed up early too so how early did that Houston bus leave?? And why did the bus driver even say okay to me after seeing my ticket?? Typically drivers make announcements too about where we‚Äôre headed and I realize she never made that announcement either.

Fine. I get to Dallas, call RedCoach. They apologize and book me a ticket to Houston. The new bus ends up being an hour delayed and I have to wait more than 3 hours.

Applying to Admin Associate jobs at UT - insights & tips welcome! (career-shift story too),https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1gjnabr/applying_to_admin_associate_jobs_at_ut_insights/,5,5,2024-11-04 19:45:36,"I'm 25, making a career shift and joining the workforce. I'm set on hopefully landing an admin associate job at UT, for 2 purposes:

1. The benefits around education - access to resources, discounts on courses and some tuition assistance for full-time roles.

2. Want to get my foot in the door to take a master's degree there one day (I went to uni overseas and have more hoops to jump through to get accredited than I thought).

  
I've already sent several applications and am currently doing everything I know and have gotten advice on the hiring process (including the FAQ in this group).

  
**Current/Past employees - what's been your experience working at UT and how realistic is it to utilize the benefits from your job?**

  
**Also, if you're currently an admin associate (or similar role), what's the day-to-day look like? (is 8-5 really 8-5?)**



*Some context:* Making the shift purely out of passion for learning and education. I've been in business - both owning my own for a little bit and running biz operations for others - and after a few years and a particularly tough yet eye-opening year so far (2024), I've decided to redefine what success and happiness looks like and just do me.

Came from nothing (homeless at 16) and worked my tail off to be where I'm at today, and I'm very proud of the life and choices I get to make today. It's just that I did what I *had* to, never what I *wanted* to do, hence this shift.

Spent a lot of months adjusting my lifestyle to accommodate the significant pay-cut I'd be taking (no more car, take the bus, shop at Aldi's, cooking at home, rent from $1800 to $725, etc) and I've never felt more at ease to take this step and not live with the regret of never having tried üôèü•π"

Premed Physics and Gen Chem DC / CBE Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1gjt9f7/premed_physics_and_gen_chem_dc_cbe_question/,1,1,2024-11-04 23:58:31,"Hi, I'm a freshman studying biomedical engineering on the pre-med route. Regarding gen chem 2, and physics 1 and 2, it is advisable to doing those credits (at least gen chem 2 and physics 1) over this winter, and then physics 2 over summer?

this would free up my schedule and let me take more classes in my degree plan so i have more time to do other premed classes like psych, soci, genetics, ochem 2 and ochem lab. It's because BME already has so many credit hours so it would be very hard to squeeze all of the premed reqs in with a minor / certificate.

I've talked to a premed advisor as apart of a club and he took both genchems and physics over summer and had no problems getting interviews and i think a few acceptances to med schools right now, but my advisor tells me its unorthodox and might look a bit weird.

For reference, I'm also in gen chem 1 rn, and have like a 100 and for physics 1 and 2, I have a really solid understanding of them and am only learning more through this really hard engineering club I'm in (formula student), so I have no doubt that even if I don't learn the most over these summer / winter courses that I will still have a really solid understanding.

If summer / winter courses are not preferred, what do you think about taking the CBE for these courses, and I'm sure with studying over summer that I would be able to pass these, so would a CBE technically be better than a DC course?

If you have read this long, thank you for your time and response."

I signed up for 16 hours for this semester so I can graduate in the spring and felt like I could handle the amount of coursework, especially if I took myself out of most responsibilities in an org I was/am in and prioritized my classes even more than I usually do.

I felt really good about this semester going in to it, but due to a myriad of factors (having to move into a new place on October 1st because of roommate problems, having to help a friend get checked in to a hospital for mental health issues, childhood dog having to be put down, among others) I just constantly feel like I'm playing catch-up/defense. I've fully gone inactive in the above mentioned org and regularly use 70% of my weekend to solely work on homework. And I'm still drowning.

I was wondering if there was a way to have a whole semester become P-F or something along those lines so I could stress a little bit less about possibly having to add \*another\* semester to my already extended stay. If I could just ""mulligan"" everything up to this point and hit the ground running with everything else for the rest of the semester I feel I would be fine. But things such as the lab assignment I had due on Friday that I'm still completing that I still have to turn in even if the only score I get is a 0 are making that hard.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice you could give me based on a few things:

I‚Äôm looking for a shared room with a community bathroom. I‚Äôm a pretty outgoing person and really want to get the full *college experience*, so I‚Äôm hoping for a place where people are open to making friends. I‚Äôve heard Jester has a strong social vibe, but it‚Äôs a bit pricier. Do you think it‚Äôs worth the extra cost for the social experience, or do other dorms also have a similar vibe?

I‚Äôm studying Biomedical Engineering, so being near the engineering buildings would be great. However, I‚Äôll probably take classes in other areas, so I‚Äôd ideally like a dorm that‚Äôs somewhat centrally located.

Lastly, I‚Äôd like to consider which dining halls are included with the dorm meal plans, how close they are, and how good they are, as this might also influence my decision.

Thanks so much in advance for any tips or experiences you can share!"

EDIT 1: Just in case someone finds this post from searching, I got my contract on November 15th!

Does anyone know Bevo‚Äôs genetic lineage?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1gdjqdf/does_anyone_know_bevos_genetic_lineage/,36,4,2024-10-27 19:57:33,"
As an SFA lumberjack and the son of two Aggies, I come in peace.

Ahem‚Ä¶

For some context, I work with oxen as part of my job. An ox, (plural *oxen*) is a cow, typically a steer, that has been trained for draft work, in the same way horses or mules are often trained.

Longhorns were, and to a small extent still are, used as oxen, mostly in the Northeast. 

My question is: does anyone happen to know Bevo‚Äôs genetic history? Is he a pureblooded longhorn, or does he have traces of other breeds hidden away somewhere that helped him bulk up to his current size and horn length?

Fort Griffin, located in Albany, TX, is home to the official State of Texas Longhorn herd. They have been breeding their herd to be closer to what longhorns would have looked like in the mid-19th century, I.e. shorter overall horns, and smaller body frame. That factoid is what made me think of my question in the first place.

Side-note: With proper training, I think Bevo would be a good ox, though longhorns can be tough to train due to their genetic heritage."

I might have done better in quant but this is what it is right now. I feel 161 quant is overall low and might create a negative impact for the applications.

Also, I can get 3 Academic LORs or 2 acad + 1 from industry.

In such scenario shall I submit GRE scores as they are not compulsory while applying for MS in ECE at UT Austin?  Would they matter that much? 

Same is the question for other universities such as NC state , Purdue , TAMU , Georgia Tech?"

My last questions are just about where stuff is. So for the engineering thing, it says to go to ‚ÄúMulva Auditorium‚Äù but I can‚Äôt find anything for that on google maps except for Mulva Clinic for Nuerosciences. Is that the same or another building?

I‚Äôve always really respected this school for being a place full of trustworthy students who don‚Äôt steal from others. To be honest, I thought the rule was due to how packed it can get and how students have trouble finding a place to sit. So I thought the rule was, ‚Äúif you get up for any reason, you have to surrender your seat.‚Äù Which I thought was a ridiculous bandaid on the problem that doesn‚Äôt solve anything for anyone, hence the frustration.

The monthly price is reduced from what appears to be a monthly concession. However, I heard from a friend that the concession is only for the first month. Upon review of the lease, it appears to be monthly, but that the concession can be taken away at the landlord‚Äôs discretion. Can any one currently living there confirm if they received the monthly concession or not?"

Is AET a viable degree for game design jobs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1gbdatv/is_aet_a_viable_degree_for_game_design_jobs/,3,6,2024-10-24 21:01:41,"I'm wondering if anyone knows how useful this degree would be for getting a game design job. I've heard that although a degree helps, more important aspects are networking and portfolios, but I still want to make sure I'm choosing the right degree. 

I've also been warned of expensive specialized schools, such as Digipen in Washington, hence why I'm looking into this school instead even though Digipen is local.

Additionally, one factor to consider is that I'm transferring from a community college with a Digital Media Arts associate degree.

Most of my experience is doing character and technical art, but what I want to learn is game design, so that I can potentially get a job in that.   


TDLR; is AET worth the time and money if I'm looking for game design work?"
