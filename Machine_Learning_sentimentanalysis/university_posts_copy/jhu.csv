My son has a football offer to JHU but he's uncertain ,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1gwr4hk/my_son_has_a_football_offer_to_jhu_but_hes/,0,2,2024-11-21 21:40:12,"My HS senior son currently has a football offer to Johns Hopkins and has until the ED2 deadline to decide. He's currently undecided on what to do, as he's considering his options -> possible walk-on football spots on an Ivy but no guarantee like JHU. 

He's likely to major in Economics with a minor in Applied Math and Statistics or vice versa. 

Between football and schoolwork, he's not likely to have a ton of available time, especially in-season, but when not busy, I'm sure he'd like to have some fun. From what I've read on here, JHU certainly doesn't have the most happening social scene, but is there fun to be had on weekends on/off campus?

Also, I just read about the Student Center that's supposed to open next year. Is that something the students are looking forward to, and do you think it will add a lot to campus life?

Any info is greatly appreciated!"

The letter stated that I have to complete all 3 prerequisities of linear algebra/differential equations/python programming.

1. Do they send this list of prerequisites as a general list for everyone accepted provisionally? Or is this actually personalized?

2. Is there any way for them to re-assess? Since I have completed those during my undergrad. Or is it totally unaccepted since I completed those outside US/Canada and I would have to retake them anyway?

3. Anyone has any recommendation where to take those prerequisites online which is cheaper than JHU? (Fyi, JHU charges ~$1.5k per course)"

* Molecular Biology (3 credits)
* Neuro: Cells and Systems I (3 credits)
* Orgo Lab (3 credits)
   * Taking orgo this year but there were literally like two seats for orgo lab remaining for registration -- so I have to take it next year
* Biochemistry (3 credits)
* Introduction to Fiction & Poetry II (3 credits)

Total: 15 credits (and ostensibly crippling anxiety)

I'm also planning on doing research next year, so I may do the Research Neuroscience course thing. I'd appreciate it anyone can send me syllabi for any of the courses above.

I've heard horror stories about Cells and Systems and Orgo Lab, so I'm completely ready to get run over (btw does someone have a drive w/ all of the cells and systems notes? if so please dm pls and ty!!).

Weighing Options /w JH APL Internship,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1gq3jti/weighing_options_w_jh_apl_internship/,3,4,2024-11-13 03:20:29,"Hi!

Burner account for privacy and I don't want to disclose the industry I am working in. I've been put in quite a difficult situation recently regarding my internship opportunities and want to share my story and hear your thoughts on it (esp from people who have interned at APL). 

I've been interning at the same place since my freshman year and am leaving due to internal struggles the company is having. Two months ago I applied for an intern position with JH APL and was excited to see an interview scheduled the next day. I think it went well and waited for results. Two months later to present day, I started weighing other options because of how long it was taking (though my application was still under review in the portal). I was bummed because there is some stuff I like about Hopkins that could make me more competitive in my industry, I was interested in the work (though I am interested in the work everywhere I am applying since its the same type of work), and APL is a big internship name! I ended up applying to two more companies (small, but same work and good full-time and internship pay and transition to full-time opportunities). I heard back with offers from both companies the next day, the first company (let's say company A) of which I'd love to work at (although I love both). Then I get an email from APL notifying me that I was still being looked at and considered. However, company A gave me a timeline of 4 days initially to accept their offer. I argued that since I am currently employed I should have a much longer timeline and they extended it to the end of November, with the caveat that they would no longer reserve my offer. This means that if someone else interviewed and got an offer and there were no other slots left, my slot which is in superposition, would be taken. I am now still after over 2 months, waiting for ANYTHING from JH APL because it is my first choice. I am however worried, because company A is not bad either and every day I wait, the chances I lose that opportunity increase. I am so at a lost of what to do, how long I should wait (I really want APL) and if I should even wait. Any advice from workforce, APL interns or people with opinions would be great. Cheers!"

1. I'm getting the impression that most astronomy students major in Physics and not EAPS. What are some differences between student/research experience at the two departments?
2. Are research/internship positions hard to acquire? How do you interact with professors in a research context? (e.g. mostly virtually, in a lab, in a coffee shop, etc.)
3. To what extent do you collaborate with other undergrads/grads in research?
4. To what extent do you collaborate with people from other institutions (Space Telescope, APL, NASA Goddard, etc.)?
5. Is it easy to pursue a double major? Which ones are most convenient, and which ones would be most useful?
6. What cool things does your department/research group do? (anything you enjoy or think is unique to JHU)
7. Is it hard to balance coursework with research?

I also have a few questions about the general JHU experience for those who don't have experience in Astronomy:

8. Is it hard to audition into the symphony orchestra? If I want to continue music as a side hobby, how much will I get to play at Peabody (private lessons, orchestra rehearsals, etc.)

9. What are your favorite spots to study/hang out, and why? (can be on or off campus)

I know a lot of people feel the same, others it doesn't bother as much (the material does have the potential to be manageable and interesting) or they don't feel comfortable admitting it. Any current students or alumni feel free to disagree, but regardless I want prospective students to know that I know so many people in the major that took classes outside of jhu and got so much more out of it despite it being simpler and covering less material.

If you're good enough to get into jhu, I'm sure you'll be able to get through it, but I'm not talking about getting through it, I'm talking about getting value out of the time you'll be putting in getting you're degree.

To be generous and give the program as a whole as much credit as I can, the graduate level offerings could be more rewarding and meaningful if you already have a solid foundation.  i could see myself going to the masters program if I did my bachelors somewhere else first. So if you have the option, I would suggest  going to a slightly 'worse' school for bachelors.  From my/others limited experience, you might get a better education out of it, maybe even a better quality of life from the time you save yourself, or at least set yourself up for an easier time learning more advanced topics in the future. Hope this helps."

I was just wondering if “we do not consider demonstrated interest” is actually true.

I spent two summers participating in summer programs at JHU; it’s been my dream school since elementary school, and I genuinely enjoyed being able to experience the community.

When I told my friends about going to those programs, many of them said they heard rumors that JHU is a school that considers loyalty/interest as an important factor. With college apps being due in just a few weeks, I began to wonder if the rumors were true.

When I checked the website and some college info sites, though, they all said that JHU doesn’t look at demonstrated interest at all and that it doesn’t care about any summer programs you took.

My school counselor thinks the summer programs should still improve my chances of getting into the school, despite it being “not considered” on the surface.

It makes sense for it to not be considered, but at the same time I feel like if it were to be considered, I would have a nice little addition to my application.

What do you think?

Also, English is not my first language so please excuse any mistakes. Thank you :)"

Can you withdraw from a course and take it externally? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1fzbjll/can_you_withdraw_from_a_course_and_take_it/,8,10,2024-10-08 21:46:04,"Does anyone know that? 

Apparently it says on the website that: 

""Students may retake a course to absolve a grade of C+ or lower. The grade for the second attempt and the associated credits are recorded on the transcript and are calculated into the GPA. The original grade remains along with the notation ""R"" to indicate the course was retaken, and the original grade does not affect grade point calculations, nor does it carry credit toward graduation. 

To absolve a grade, the same course must be taken at Hopkins, not at another college or university."" 

Is W counted as a grade or is it just a letter?"

I do not recommend Jefferson House,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1f1qpkr/i_do_not_recommend_jefferson_house/,24,4,2024-08-26 15:15:54,"Jefferson House is an apartment building next to Homewood campus. I **do not recommend** living at Jefferson House. 

Jefferson House has many of the same problems that other old buildings in Baltimore have, such as peeling lead paint, ancient stoves and radiators, and no central HVAC. There is one elevator that is shared with the whole apartment and it breaks down occasionally. Every few weeks they shut off the water for plumbing repairs. The walls are so thin, you can hear conversations outside even from the higher floors. I heard these are all common with old buildings, so I imagine these are problems at other places as well.

What is more frustrating is getting random charges on your bills, and management being unresponsive to that. I will give just one example.

3-4 months ago, my water bill **more than doubled** in price. I did not change my habits or use more water than usual, but the bill is now exorbitantly high. Management did not address this. Management ignored any individual complaints. When enough people complained, they put out a passive aggressive email telling residents to be more mindful of their water usage. Every month since the water bill has stayed at that high price. If you can get a hold of someone (good luck), they either tell you that you need to be mindful of your individual usage or explain that the water is split among the apartment (so then why does my individual usage matter that much?) Most of the time they are not available, either by phone or by email.

This is just one example, but several fees and charges are being tacked on in the last few months and management does not warn about them, management does not explain them, and management will not be helpful if you contact them.

*I tried to submit this to Google review over a week ago, but it would not accept the review. Oddly, out of the 25 other reviews, 13 (over half) are generic 5 star reviews that were all posted in the same time frame. Those seem much more like spam or fake reviews than what I have to say....I think people should know how Jefferson House is from the perspective of an ACTUAL resident.*"

Because of this, I never had access to the timesheet, and no one informed me that the issue was related to my I-9 record until after the semester ended. When I finally received the emails, I told them that they had my name wrong, which allowed them to find my I-9, but then I was terminated (I’m not even sure what my status was before that?).

That being so, depending on how many credits I earn, I will come up about 4-6 credits short of my 120 credit requirement as a senior. My major requirements are fully done, so now I am taking courses simply for credits. I think I’m going to take the route of taking classes I simply enjoy instead of adding on a minor. From what I’ve learned, summer financial assistance has been VERY limited  the past 2 years and many students get turned away. And to qualify for the Pell Grant for summer courses (which is also very limited in what can be offered), I would need to take at least 6 courses apparently. That equates to about $7,830. I’m not sure if it is worth going down that route for a POSSIBILITY of some aid or if it would be better to transfer credits from a community college or something. I was also wondering if I could do research over the summer to earn credits without paying. Let me know what you think is a good road to go down and/or if you have similar experiences and advice.

You cannot study too much, you cannot study too little, you cannot party too hard, you cannot socialize too little. Stop trying to figure out what you ""should"" be doing as a college student. The point of being in college is that you're now in charge of your own life, trying to follow some template of a model student will 99%, dare I say 100% of the time lead to disappointments, self-doubts, and impostor syndrome.

No one is breathing down your neck telling you to put at least 5 hours a day doing homework. No one will care if you didn't show up to class (except the occasional attendance grades for some classes). No one cares how you dress. No one cares that you stayed in your room all day. You can do anything you want, it's your life now, and you have to be willing to put up with whatever consequences come your way.

You don't want to study? Be prepared for a non-A grade. You got an A anyway? Well maybe that class is on the easier side for you, so you know to spend your time working on other classes. Last midterm didn't go as well as expected? Then it's time to put some more hours in studying for the next one. Want to skip class? I mean i suggest you don't, but no one's gonna come knocking down your doors looking for you. Asking how much you should study makes as much sense as asking what you should eat for lunch (as in everybody's taste buds are different, the appropriate amount of time spent studying is different for everyone). If you want to ask, ask specific questions about credit requirements, about how to structure your class hours, about what to expect about a certain class, about the extracurriculars around here. None of this ""How should I live my life"" type of questions for god's sake. 

It is a new environment. You're most likely overwhelmed. That's okay! It's actually kind of the point. No change happens without discomfort and uncertainty. If you feel like you got it all figured out freshman year, that's when I'd actually be suspicious of how much you actually got figure out. You got this, stop stressing, accept the struggles that come your way, and recognize that it doesn't mean you're doing something wrong, but quite the opposite."

I'm a recently accepted student at JHU. Super excited to be a part of a really cool university. I have a handful of questions. 

What is/was AAP like for you?

How responsive is faculty when encountering problems?

How difficult has it been to take classes online?

Those are just a few. I'm pretty nervous about starting. I even have a slight case of imp. synd. simply because this program is almost all online and some don't consider it a genuine degree like many others offered at JHU. What are your opinions on this matter?

Both research positions are online, so I guess that is convenient. I don't want to over schedule and lose my will to live, but I don't want to lose this good opportunity. "

Hi, I'm a high school senior deciding where to apply right now! 

I visited both schools, and could see myself going to either. 

That being said, I may be considering ED for either of these places, but these are definitely my top two for RD. I also want to note that I will be pre-med and definitely want to go to medical school in the future.

In terms of prestige, I'm aware that the program at JHU is great and almost impossible to get into, and I like the layout of the BME 2.0 program and how you can choose from different concentrations (neuroengineering for example). I am also aware that BME and pre-med is a lethal  pairing for med school admissions. So, is the program worth it?

Also, are there any notable study abroad programs and research/opportunities in general for BME majors at both schools? As a BME major, do we ever have projects associated with the medical school and the hospital, and if so, how often (would be a huge plus for me)?

For current Blue Jays, what is your favorite part of  JHU in general? I hope these questions can help me answer my dilemma. Thanks!!"

I can't even fathom medical school debt which would put at least $250k on top for my debt. I am stressed but JHU BME is my dream program for undergrad, however I am worried about cost. Are you guys able to get scholarships (I heard there was aid from Bloomberg?), California FAFSA aid of some sort, or are simply able to afford it?

My parents insist I still early decision to JHU BME and chase my dreams however I don't want to be in $120k debt before medical school even begins (my parents can only roughly pay $30k out of the $60k JHU yearly tuition). Due to interest on debt over the years, should I simply not risk it and try to sway my parents in another direction?

1. **Layering Basics**: What essentials should I look for, and how can I layer them based on the temperature/month? I plan to buy most of my winter gear after arriving in Baltimore.
2. **Brands and Stores**: Any recommendations for good brands that offer quality winter clothing? Also, are there any stores in Baltimore where I can find these items?
3. **Thermals**: Which thermals would you suggest? Are there specific materials or brands that work best for Baltimore's winter?
4. **Winter/Rainy Boots**: Since it can be rainy and windy, what are some good winter/rainy boots that you recommend? I'm looking for something durable and comfortable.
5. **Timing**: Between September and late December, when will I start needing the winter wear? I know it's hot in August and September, but when should I be prepared for the colder weather to kick in?

I understand it's probably a smaller list, but the email specified that they had already reached their target class size - so why bother leading kids on even longer? Based on previous cycles, the extended waitlist is impossible to get off of because there's basically no way anyone would suddenly decide to not attend this late into the summer, especially when almost all other schools have closed their waitlists.

Even if someone miraculously gets off, what about housing? What about choosing classes?

It was getting pretty stormy, so I was in a hurry to not get caught out by the rain. Alas, I shouldn't have rushed at all- because right as I approached the footbridge I lost my footing, and I fell!

I took a pretty hard landing, and I ended up spraining my right ankle. I was barely able to hobble the few hundred meters until the Rec center, where I was able to get some help.

Now I'm barely able to hobble around my room, and it's clear that I can't walk unaided. I'm going to need a pair of crutches, and on short notice too - especially since I'm supposed to be moving out of my sublet tomorrow, and flying out of the country on Saturday afternoon!

Hence, on a long shot - I'm reaching out to the Hopkins community to see if anyone would have a pair of crutches (that they're not currently using). I would be very grateful to have them.

Consider that my screen time is at minimal. If I chose to take 15 credits a semester, and for each course I did the HW/Assignments as soon as possible (no procrastination), and studied daily.  

As a CS major, I definitely will stay away from the hard courses, like I'm not planning on taking discrete math or even calc 3.

1.  Wake up 2 hours prior to 8 AM and finish up whatever I need to do (only priority stuff)
2. 8-11 I'll be at lectures, and taking notes. (all of my selected courses are in the morning)
3. and then from 11-2, I work on assignments/ study during this time
4. and from 2-4 I have another lecture
5. Let's assume I spend another 2 hours studying/assignments from 5-6
6. **Will I be able to have 6 PM - 11 PM Free to work on any extra stuff I want?**

Freshman Fall Schedule (Psychology + Pre-Med),https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1e4px7c/freshman_fall_schedule_psychology_premed/,1,3,2024-07-16 14:22:40,"Hi! I'm an incoming freshman hoping to major in psychology on the pre-med track, but also leaving the  options of public health, behavioural biology, and neuroscience as possible double majors. I'm currently stuck in terms of what courses to take in the fall because of the semesters in which certain courses are offered.

**My first option would look like this:**

1. Calculus I (4 credits)

2. Introductory Chemistry I (3 credits) 

3. Introductory Chemistry I Laboratory (1 credit)

4. General Biology I (3 credits)

5. General Biology I Laboratory (1 credit)

6. FYS (3 credits)

*TOTAL: 15 credits*

* PROS: This option would help me fulfill my pre-med requirements as well as recommended courses for behavioural biology/neuroscience.
* CONS: However, this option would mean that I basically didn't fulfill anything for my psychology major or get to take any introductory courses for public health either, because the credit limit is 17 and I can't fit another course in. This also means that I'm not as interested in the courses I'm taking...

  
**My second option would look like this:**

1. Calculus I (4 credits)

2. Introductory Chemistry I (3 credits) 

3. Introductory Chemistry I Laboratory (1 credit)

4. General Biology I (3 credits)

5. Introduction to Psychology (3 credits)

6. FYS (3 credits)

*TOTAL: 17 credits*

* PROS: This option allows me to basically get some pre-med requirements down and get to take introduction to psychology, which I hear is not too difficult of a course and one that I know I'll be happy taking. 
* CONS: My concern with this one is that I won't be able to take General Biology I Lab with the lecture course, and I basically would have to wait for sophomore fall to take it, which I don't know if it's ideal or not.

  
**My third option would look like this:**

1. Calculus I (4 credits)

2. Introductory Chemistry I **OR** General Biology I (3 credits) 

3. Introductory Chemistry I Laboratory (1 credit) **OR** General Biology I Laboratory (1 credit)

4. FBBC (3 credits)

5. Introduction to Psychology (3 credits)

6. FYS (3 credits)

*TOTAL: 17 credits*

* PROS: This option is probably one that is the most tailored towards psychology and my interests and was my initial ideal schedule.
* CONS: However, I'm concerned that FBBC would be too heavy of a workload for my freshman fall, and that not taking either Chem 1 or Bio 1 in my freshman year would put me behind, because they are only offered in the fall (or summer but I don't want to take summer courses!!!)
   * side note (idk if it's relevant or not): Currently, I'm thinking of taking Introduction to Public Health in the spring to explore my interest in that field because I can't think of a way to fit it in my current schedule (since it's 4 credits), but I do feel like it would make my life slightly easier compared to taking FBBC...??? Please correct me if I'm wrong!

incoming freshman question about scheduling,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1e10lqy/incoming_freshman_question_about_scheduling/,2,6,2024-07-11 21:44:28,"I am currently a rising freshman who has a lot of questions about the scheduling process. My major is MolCellBio and I am questioning whether or not I should be premed. With this in mind, I want my schedule to have the flexibility to transition from a premed courseload to something that fits well with a grad school application as smoothly as possible. My biggest question is what math course I should do. I read all the reddit posts talking about how calc 1 and calc 2 were terrible and much harder than their high school counterparts so I should skip to calc 3 which is supposedly easier. Others say that calc 1 and calc 2 are good for the gpa boost so I should take them and not even touch calc 3 for my entire time at Hopkins. I'm not exceedingly good at Math but I did get fives on both the ap calc exams so I know the very basics. If I were to go premed, what is stopping me from taking an easy stats class for a semester to boost my gpa such as biostats? Would med schools view that as incompetent if I choose to take biostats by using my ap credits for the calculus courses? Additionally, if I do decide to take this route would it possibly hurt my grad school application in the future? I'm just confused as to why more people don't take easy stats courses to boost their gpa and avoid gpa tanks such as the calculus courses, linear algebra, and differential equations. Thank you so much and I look forward to reading all the replies."

In a nutshell, I understand there are probably excellent research opportunities and connections that can be made via JHU, but if that's the big advantage, how does that compare to.....let's say a Purdue where there are also numerous influential research opportunities? There's maybe some prestige with JHU, but do you find anyone cares beyond your first job? What are the other pros you realized post-grad? 

Again, using Purdue as an example, I'm struggling with the ""is it worth it"" question. If we were talking 10k more it'd be less of a question, but when you're pushing towards 100K/yr and it's more than double some other upper-tier engineering schools, then I'd like real differentiators before committing."

I am applying to schools that have higher acceptance rates and that I am close to the average GPA of, and will just do CC/transfer if nothing works out.

The only thing I really have control over now is my essay and to some extent, my LORs. I know those two alone won't make up for an overall weak profile though.

I know that it is unrealistic to believe that I can get into JHU, but I still would like to apply just to put myself at ease.

Not applying = 0% Acceptance Chance Applying = 0.000001% Acceptance Chance

I want to apply ED 1 just to get the result over with, and not bother dwelling on it.

I know graduate school is always an option, but I want to be pre-med. I also know that with the small amount of medical schools in US, I would be lucky to get into just one school. So which it is would not matter much to me at that point.

i have a 3.2 freshman gpa (due to mold and mice in my dorm and 24/7 headaches) from a private lib arts school, should i just give up now and not waste time filling out the jhu app if my chances suck? I am confident i can get a 4.0 during the first semester of sophomore year. i currently have a research position at jhu and am close w/ a professor there. plan to apply as a philosophy major with an interest in premed. i have like 100+ clinical volunteering hours at a baltimore city hospital and can def get 200+ by the time application season rolls around. plan to do volunteer emt as well and develop demonstrable data science skills. i am a strong writer and have a good reason for transfer. basically i am wondering if my poor freshman gpa will trump even a compelling mission statement and upward sophomore year grade trend, decent EC’s, and good letters of rec.

should i just finish the whole sophomore year at my current school and apply for jhu during the spring application cycle in march for next year’s fall transfer, or just call it and apply to UMDCP/UMBC this oct/nov and just start attending in the upcoming spring semester? again, i actually hate my school so i do not want to spend another semester here unnecessarily just to apply to jhu and maybe other schools in march when i don’t even stand a chance. when i could have just transferred to one of the UMD schools and started knocking out credits in the spring semester instead of focusing on more transfer apps. not too keen on delaying graduation as i want to keep on the doctor path as consistently as possible, and want to just speedrun all the required classes before med school. i understand it’s a marathon and not a sprint but still. 

really want to attend jhu but i know my worth and am not about to grovel for a school who doesn’t want me at face value. if i apply i’m just gonna be genuine.

I hope you're all doing well!

I’m an incoming master's student in the Mechanical Engineering department, and I’m currently trying to decide between :Essay - Research and Writing, Essay – Co-Op, and All-Course. I would love to hear your experiences and advice to help me make an informed decision.

A bit about my goals and preferences:

•	I aim to work in R&D with a good package.
•	I’m very interested in conducting research.
•	Gaining practical, hands-on experience in an industry setting is very important to me.
•	I need to start working immediately after graduation to pay off my loans.
•	Building a professional network during my master’s program is crucial.
•	I prefer having a flexible career path with broad opportunities.
•	I’m open to further education like a Ph.D., depending on financial considerations.

If you have experience with any of these options or know someone who does, I’d greatly appreciate your insights!

Thanks in advance for your help!"

long story short, while applying for CPT I always assumed students don't need to pay to do CPT. Well I got CPT approval and read the CPT tuition policy and noticed some caveats just now. 

I reached out to SEAMS about registration for this course, and basically the answer was that that I would pay the part-time tuition for this course if I register for the summer. The CPT tuition policy for WSE international students also said if a part-time student is enrolled only in EN.500.851 at any point, they are subject to the part-time tuition charge. 

It sounded like the course won't bring on additional tuition charge only when you are also taking other classes in the same term. Which would not apply to me, since I'm not taking any other classes this summer.

From what I've read online, the majority of the people doing EP are early-career engineers looking for advancement. The master's counts as 2 years of experience and they get a bump in salary. Almost none of them are thinking of networking outside of the company they already work at. The majority of EP graduates are Northrop Grumman employees, followed by Lockheed Martin and Raytheon (LinkedIn data). I was browsing some of the profiles and actually did see that after these people graduated, they moved up from Associate to Engineer and Engineer to Principle Engineer / Senior Engineer.

For AAP, students range from government employees, private sector employees, managers to full-time students (unemployed). People in AAP are more likely to want to transition to bigger roles in different organizations where a master's is needed.

In my experience off-reddit, questions or concerns are not met with answers, but with hostility and misinformation.

Outside of politics, here are some issues I have with how the UE has been operating in general.

# Major non-political concerns with the UE

* Why does the UE demand that all students, regardless of UE membership, pay UE fees? This is their ""union shop"" clause, and union shop isn't even legal for public sector unions. The common excuse is that the UE supported graduate students unionizing, and now we need to pay them back for their initial support. However, the **UE contracts with graduate student unions are exacting and expensive, and very hard to terminate**. In the end, graduate students would be footing most of the UE's revenue. This brings me to my next point:
* Why are graduate student unions footing an unfair share of UE expenses? See the financial numbers gathered by students at Cornell [(link)](https://sites.google.com/view/cornell-united/cgsu-ue-info/ue-financial) and MIT [(link)](https://www.uenotformit.org/#problems).
* Our partnership with the UE is often framed as a show of worker solidarity, gratitude, emotional debt, or any other vague phrase that ignores the reality that **the majority of graduate student unions are open-shop, meaning that students can opt out of supporting the national union they are partnered with.** For more details, see this table from the students at Princeton [(link)](https://pu-grads-against-ue.org/ue.html#ue-demands-union-shop).
* We have the right to withhold the portion of fees that goes to political activities (about 39% of total dues, according to MIT - [link](https://www.uenotformit.org/#object)). However, when MIT students tried to exercise this right, their requests were denied, and **they only had their rights upheld after a lawsuit** [(link)](https://sites.google.com/view/cornell-united/union-shop#h.3o4q7si7hovw). Why should I trust an organization that will step over laws and rights, if that gets in the way of their collecting money?

Emphasis on that last point: you have the right to redirect the part of your fee that goes toward political contributions (\~39% of total dues) to a non-union, non-religious charity. This is a really important point for me, and I want to let anyone else know who is uncomfortable with financially contributing to the UE's politics. However, it is unclear whether this is actually possible in practice, without a lawsuit...

# What choice do we have now?

Now that the UE has forced a union shop clause on JHU graduate students, I am curious if anyone else is opting out of union membership. If you choose not to become a member, here is the contract you are given to sign (emphasis mine):

>I do not wish to become a member of UE Local 197. In lieu of such membership, I agree to pay to the Union an agency fee....You are hereby authorized and directed to deduct from my monthly pay, an amount equivalent to dues, fees, assessments, and initiation fees, as shall be certified by the \[UE\]. This authorization and assignment is voluntarily made as an administrative convenience to facilitate **payment of dues, fees, assessments, and initiation fees that I have voluntarily agreed to make even in the absence of membership in the UE** and is not contingent upon my future membership in the UE. **This authorization and assignment shall be irrevocable** for a period of (1) year from the date I sign this card or until the end of the current collective bargaining agreement between my Employer...and the Union, whichever occurs sooner, and from year to year thereafter, **unless I give the Employer and the Union written notice to stop deducting payments under this agreement, postmarked within seven (7) days before the end of the one year period or postmarked within seven (7) days before the end of the collective bargaining agreement.** I understand that the Employer will stop deductions from my wages, and the Union will stop receiving them, effective the month after the month in which the written notice of revocation is given. Revocation shall be effective only if I give the Employer and UE Local 197 written notice, and it is received or postmarked during the period specified above. This authorization will remain in effect in the event that I am laid off, leave work on a leave of absence, or separate from employment with my present Employer. I authorize deductions to resume upon the resumption of employment as a new hire or otherwise.

I am disturbed by the language. If I sign, this says the payment of dues, fees, assessments, and initiation fees are VOLUNTARY, when I was told that I had no choice in this. Also, if we opt out of authorizing our employer to automatically deduct our paychecks to support the UE, what happens to the back dues we supposedly owe? How does this impact us?"

I recently heard about the University of Maryland having this site for grades and courses:

Its genius! Students review all their courses on one database and it shows grade distribution per professor and course reviews in one place.

Online part time masters of biomedical engineering at JHU - any thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1d2x10c/online_part_time_masters_of_biomedical/,1,0,2024-05-28 22:49:56,"I'm a working professional who wants to get up to speed with new technologies.

The other university I am considering for this course is Purdue. Both universities are unique in the courses they offer. So I think my question boils down to the following -

1. Does JHU have better clinical connections that would allow for more interactions with the community?
2. Does it have more all-rounded teaching methods and not just textbooks and exams?
3. Any other information that might be useful?"

"Graduate student union joined with pro-Russia, anti-nuclear group",https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1d2oj1l/graduate_student_union_joined_with_prorussia/,0,21,2024-05-28 17:05:29,"I am sure many of you are aware, but graduate student workers at Hopkins unionized a couple months ago. As a graduate student worker myself , this sounds amazing: we receive higher stipend and more benefits, and all of these things are shouted from the rooftops as a great success for student workers everywhere, in solidarity with workers everywhere.

I recently learned that, after a lot of contentious discussion, the graduate students at Princeton University did NOT unionize. A lot of issues were raised regarding the UE, the union they were planning to join with. The UE is a politically divisive, pro-Russia, anti-nuclear union. 70% of graduate student union dues would have had to go to supporting the UE. Many students saw this as unnecessary, especially as many graduate schools have successfully unionized without the UE.  
(For a full discussion of why Princeton students did not want to join with the UE, see https://pu-grads-against-ue.org/)

Hopkins graduate students are required to pay union dues, whether they are part of the union or not. I am not comfortable with my money going to support the UE. I feel I should have the **right to choose** whether my money goes to the UE or not, just like the **majority of unions at other graduate schools.**

Is anyone else uncomfortable with how the Hopkins student union does not give us this right?"

I have some more questions as an undergrad pre-frosh.

1. Recently I've become interested in walking robots and JHU has at least one lab for this. If I don't get accepted for research there, is it unprofessional for me to ask to just sit and watch them work? Would they generally say no?
2. I know Hopkins has campus security. My family is also planning to move to Baltimore. Assuming that they reside within the JHU Security Patrol Line Perimeter, will they be able to get help from JHU security if they feel unsafe? Are they able to use the Blue Light System?
3. Are there any zero-alcohol parties at JHU? I think my folks would feel better if I could go to parties where there is no possibility of me getting drunk.
4. Is there any karaoke on JHU campus itself?(Homewood)
5. So in regards to dating, I've never dated and got declined the one time I did ask someone, so I don't have much xp. If I asked someone to work on a CS extracurricular project as a first date(like a hackathon), would that be seen as weird or okay?
6. I've seen posts that say that there is much for to JHU than medicine. And from what I see for my field(CS) this is true. But there also seems to be a heavy focus on medicine --- JHU calls itself ""University of Medicine"", there is a chemistry placement test but not a physics one, etc. Have any non-med majors, preferably in engineering(except for biomed eng.), who are not sure or have decided that they don't want to go into healthcare, felt out-of-place because of this?

I was trying to plan a 4-year class schedule, and I was wondering if I could have some advice on whether I should take the AP credit for intro classes if I don't know for sure whether I want to pursue an MD or a PhD. 

FYI I have gotten a 5 on AP Statistics, AP Calc BC, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and APES. I was also interested in pursuing the combined BS/MS program for molecular and cell bio, but how competitive/difficult is that program? Do you think it is feasible as a student athlete coming in with this many credits?

Also, I have heard that some med schools do not like to see students skipping out on the intro classes. Generally, taking the harder classes might lower my GPA and look bad on my application. But, for PhD programs, I would assume taking more challenging classes would be better for my application. So, would you recommend taking the intro classes and not skipping out on it?

New Transfer Student's Questions!,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1cuk1j6/new_transfer_students_questions/,2,2,2024-05-17 23:56:49,"Hello

I am a newly admitted transfer student and was wondering about the ins and outs of academics and everyday life.

  
I am planning on majoring in Biology and possibly pursuing a dual degree in chemistry on a pre-med track.

  
1) **How would you suggest planning schedules for upcoming semesters ahead of time; choosing professors, times, etc?**

2) **Where are the best places to live while being close to campus?**

3) I come from a state-school where students are mostly open to collaborating for studying for exams. I have heard that it tends to be pretty cut-throat here; I was wondering how true this holds to be. **Is JHU cut-throat and how willing are students to collaborate for studies?**

4) How difficult is it to get A+/A's? I have always been a straight A student and have heard rumors about grade in/deflation at JHU but have never really gotten a true understanding of the situation. **How real is grade inflation or deflation at JHU?** 

5) **How easy is it to get research on campus and clinical experience in Baltimore as a student?** Are all of the positions taken because everyone is gunning for the positions, or is it more or less easy because of the abundance of positions. 

6) **How would you describe your interpersonal relationships amongst your peers and professors?** Do you feel as if you are always being pressured by others or are people more laid back?

7) I hear people are always studying, which I am more than excited for, but I was wondering **if studies are overwhelming for most students?**

  
Thank you for any help. I have numbered the questions so you can answer specific ones if you do not have answers for all. I appreciate any help you can offer and I look forward to meeting you all this upcoming fall!

How available are piano practice rooms?,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1cuau3r/how_available_are_piano_practice_rooms/,3,6,2024-05-17 17:18:11,"Hello, I’m an incoming freshman who’s planning on majoring in neuroscience on the premed track. One of my favorite hobbies is playing the piano, and I’d really like to continue it in college. I want to know how busy the practice rooms tend to be to determine whether I should buy a digital for my dorm or just use the rooms to practice. On another note, I’d also like to know the quality of the school pianos. Are they well maintained? Thank you in advance!"

I have a 3.53/4.00 Bachelor's (Life Sciences), and a 3.844/4.00 Master's (Bioinformatics) GPA. I have been working as a Project Scientist in a Computational Genomics group for the last one year. I have contributed to two AI related book chapters (published), and a publication with me as a second author is ""In Review"" right now. Additionally, I have worked on an in silico drug discovery project along with another relevant project which is still underway. I have mentored two interns (one M.Tech. student, and a summer intern). Soon, a new intern will join as well. I have a good coursework covered for a position in a Computational Biology program. In the last year, I have thoroughly looked into several research labs and supervisors. While, I am interested in a lot of programs, I can't seem to make up my mind. My main research interests are Neurodegenerative Diseases and/or Computational Genomics. I have some experience with transcriptomics datasets as well. Can existing/upcoming grad students please suggest me (looking at my profile), whether I am eligible to target jhu (with researchers doing very relevant research to my interests) and a competitive scholarship, or should I settle for some university which has researchers working in the domains I am interested in but the stipend is just enough to survive.

In order to bridge the gap between my engineering background and what's needed for a Physics PhD, I enrolled in the Applied Physics program at EP, but the courses don't seem to be rigorous enough. The same courses seem to be very rigorous at the Physics & Astronomy department of Krieger, due to which I'd like to take 6 of my remaining courses in the program at Krieger. However, the AP chair told me that ""*The AP program requires 10 graduate level courses, eight of which must be selected from AP course offerings. Two electives are allowed which are usually selected from AP or other EP programs such as ECE, A&CM, or CS. Occasionally, with advisor and Whiting School approval these may be selected from Krieger.*""

The house is 3 bed 2 bath, so it might get cramped if we get two extra people, which is why I prefer one person taking both or one of the rooms. In terms of distance, it's about 15min walking from campus, but that's not an issue if you own something like a bike.

The second house is down the street from the first, a little bigger, and roughly the same distance to Homewood. It is currently being finished now, but we're looking for subletters for the Summer and/or Fall and beyond. Current rate is $600/month + utilities for each room (it's also 3 Bed 2 Bath).

12th in cs ranking

Very reputed in general ofc but 33rd in cs ranking.

Deciding between schools (JHU vs Vanderbilt),https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1cc971u/deciding_between_schools_jhu_vs_vanderbilt/,2,18,2024-04-24 20:48:24,"Hello everyone! It's kind of late, I know, but I'm really having a tough time choosing between the two schools and was wondering if you could shed some light on what I should choose. I've read all these posts, and I'm sure they're quite repetitive but I feel as though some of my situation has not been answered.

I was originally leaning towards JHU but had some qualms regarding a few aspects of the school.

My intended major is CS and/or Systems Engineering (CS + Scientific Computing at Vandy).

**Fit:** I'm looking for a school where I'll be able to balance my business (related to my major), 1-2 clubs, and decently rigorous academics. Free time to me is important, not necessarily to socialize, but to engage in activities related to my passion outside the classroom. Not really too into ""parties,"" but interested in hanging out from time to time.

**Questions:**

**1) Free time (biggest point).** I feel like both these schools are polar opposites when it comes to academics. While Vandy CS is much weaker, the school would provide me with ample free time, and vice versa for Hopkins (to a certain extent). My question is, truly, how much time is devoted to class time/studying? Of course, it's not studying 24/7, but would you say managing a decent social life, amount of sleep, and relatively ambitious self-initiated goals is manageable? Would you advise for/against it?

**2) Entrepreneurship scene.** My interests in modeling are highly tied to both research and entrepreneurship at the same time. I'm also trying to meet some like-minded people with similar ambitions in business/startups/content creation. Would you say this exists here? Would I be ""going against the tide""? I know Carey isn't the most established, but I've researched the many resources JHU provides regardless.

**3) The city.** I went to both schools for a visit. Nashville, to me, did feel better, simply because I was in the touristy areas. In Baltimore, I lived on 27th and St. Paul (Airbnb), went to the McDonalds and Safeway in Abell/Charles Villiage/Old Goucher to eat, walked around Remington/Hampden, took a JHU bus to Mount Vernon/Peabody, walked from downtown to Inner Harbor, and finally walked Fells Point/Little Italy.

**----concern----**

You've been asked about safety 100s of times, but my dad and I were yelled at by a crazy lady a few blocks from campus on St. Paul Street while walking home (it was 10 PM). Like, she was screaming at everything and anything down the street and insulting us in broken English. While she didn't have the most threatening physique, I wonder what would happen if that was a jacked guy or someone with a weapon.

That wasn't particularly concerning, but I do believe the precautions put in place were. A few days ago, I took a look at a comment that sounded vaguely familiar: [https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1as4elp/comment/l03hwxb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1as4elp/comment/l03hwxb/)

""I recently got harassed in the CVS by a crazy lady and she verbally assaulted me for 10 minutes."" (1 day after I had that experience)

If it was the same lady right next to the Homewood Campus (likely because all she had to do was continue her current path trajectory; CVS is on St. Paul), that's quite concerning. Because 1) it's within the designated ""Patrol Area"" and 2) I talked to the security guard about it (further down St. Paul) and she said that she was yelled at too, but shrugged it off.

**My question:** how good are the safety measures actually put in place? Yes, there's blue light, shuttle, police, etc. But if a person, who clearly has an issue, can walk right outside the campus, next to the dorms, in spite of safety measures -- that's concerning to me. Again, just an x-factor; it is something I can deal with, but would rather not have to. Maybe I was just unlucky.

**Gut feeling:** Vandy seems like the ""safe"" option. I'll be happy/not stressed/feel safer, but I don't think I'll be truly fulfilled because of the weak CS dept and lack of intellectual environment. Hopkins, I feel, despite the cons will prepare me much better for my future. Both schools give affordable aid, but Vandy is 20k/yr cheaper.

I hope these questions are useful in some sense, and any perspective on these questions would help me make a decision! Thank you!

Hopkins vs Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1cbp9lj/hopkins_vs_berkeley/,9,36,2024-04-24 04:20:02,"Hello! As the title implies, I was extremely fortunate to be accepted by both UC Berkeley and Johns Hopkins but absolutely cannot decide between the two! (Honestly I’m still totally in shock, I applied to colleges fully expecting to go to either CC or a lower ranked UC!) 

For a little background, I am a California resident, low income so they’re both about the same in price, and planning on double-majoring in English and (hopefully) biology. (The double major is far more tentative since it might be too much work for me to handle). I am also intending on going into law post undergrad, ideally at Stanford, Berkeley, UCLA, or USC — being in California for grad school is very important to me!

For specifics, at Hopkins I’d major in Writing Seminars and Molecular and Cell Biology whereas at Berkeley I’d major in English and Molecular and Cell Biology. I love all things theater, film, and generally arts related, so I am hoping to pursue all those interests at least as hobbies!

Now without further ado, my pros and cons—

Hopkins Pros: 
- everyone seemed extremely intelligent, mature, focused, and driven
- The school has been incredibly supportive of me - they flew me out to admitted students day, covered my hotel, and truly made me feel welcome! I had no idea an institution could be so generous, and I would imagine this trend continues throughout the four years 
- FLI program 
- The classes are much more intimate and it is far easier to get closer with professors 
- There seems to be a lot more individualized support (which I would definitely take full advantage and truly benefit from!)
- According to the students I spoke to, it sounds like there is a lot of course flexibility 
- The housing seems great! 
- Baltimore is much cheaper than Berkeley 
- everyone involved in Barnstormers was incredibly genuine and kind. It was also very flexible with how many hours you could put into productions.
The mock trial team seems fantastic!
There is a Film and Media Studies Major so I could potentially help people out with various film projects?

Hopkins Cons:
- Most people I spoke to were pre-med, so I’m worried I would feel isolated as someone who is pre-law
- I don’t particularly like Baltimore
- The weather. I’m a sunny SoCal girl! 
- It is extremely far from home and due to some complicated family circumstances, I don’t know how manageable a potential emergency flight might be. 
- There is a foreign language requirement for writing seminars. I have tried and tried to learn a second language, but have never been successful as of now :(
- I have heard rumors of the campus being very competitive and stressful 
- Campus felt a little bit sterile
- Imposter syndrome/I struggled to picture myself there (though I believe I could certainly overcome this with time) 
- grade deflation? 

Overall, Hopkins was extremely welcoming and supportive in my experience. It is a very drastic change from the life I am used to, but I would be surrounded by the best of the best and grow immensely in a new environment. It is (I assume) much less competitive for resources and truly a once in a lifetime opportunity. However, I definitely struggle to picture myself living there and fitting in. 


Berkeley Pros:
- I absolutely adore the city. I have always wanted to live somewhere like it! 
- The campus felt very alive (granted this was likely due to it being Cal Day), and there was a ton to do in the surrounding areas (+ I am a boba addict)
- I really loved the campus and libraries. 
- One of my best friends committed and I would likely share a dorm with her. I also have several other close friends who committed
- Berkeley has a better law department, so making connections there could be very beneficial
- Not that rankings define a ton, but Berkeley is ranked #1 for English
- Nicer weather
- Double Major seems pretty doable 
- I felt more inspired in Berkeley 
- Everyone there seemed very similar to myself, and I felt as if I fit in more. 
- The theatre department seemed very friendly 
- Fantastic mock trial
- Much closer to home
- no cost of flights to and from home during breaks

Berkeley Cons: 
- I have heard countless rumors (and firsthand accounts from my friends that go there) that Berkeley fosters a very competitive and stressful environment. 
- Housing crisis + very bad dorm situations 
- Professors seem very detached 
- In general it felt as if the school had something to prove. Berkeley spent a ton of time bragging about its rankings and very little time making students actually feel welcome. Cal Day was also a lot more unorganized (of course, considering the sheer number of people, this is completely understandable!) 
- I am worried I would fall behind if I am one of countless students. I put in a lot of additional work to succeed in my classes by using my free periods to meet with my teachers, and at Berkeley, the opportunities for individualized support are significantly fewer. 
- People felt less mature and driven in comparison to Hopkins students. 
- I know several people who hated Berkeley that are pretty similar to myself 

Overall, I loved the area of Berkeley and the campus. It felt incredibly alive and I could easily see myself living there. There also seemed to be countless great opportunities in relation to my interests. Having great friends already is also a plus! However, I am worried I would be swallowed up by the immense amount of people competing for the same success. There seems to be far too many people for fewer resources, and the tinge of arrogance across the campus. "

I’ve been hearing very conflicted things about both schools based on my research and peers, and I have no idea who to believe. I was hoping maybe you guys could shed some light on your experiences that might help me choose. Here are generally what I know about both schools:

JHU:
 - Great research opportunities 
 - Cutthroat competitive (I’ve heard very mixed things)
- grade deflation (can this affect med school admission?)
- overall world-renowned pre-med institution


Duke:
- Also highly reputable premed
- grade inflation 
- generally pretty high student body happiness
- kind of a party school? 


I’d appreciate if you guys shared your thoughts, or know anyone from Duke who could share their experiences. Thanks in advance!

I am a Biomechanical Research Scholar currently serving as a senior research scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology, India. My academic journey has been fortified by a Master’s degree in Structural Engineering and a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering. 

My PhD research has been dedicated to the computational modelling of bones and orthopaedic medical devices. I have honed my technical skills in the design and failure analysis of orthopaedic implants and have garnered extensive experience in both the theoretical and practical aspects of Finite Element Analysis.

I am well-versed in FE software such as ANSYS and Abaqus, medical imaging software like MIMICS, computer-aided design tools including SOLIDWORKS and RHINOCEROS, as well as biomechanical testing and programming languages like MATLAB and Ansys APDL.

As I look to expand my horizons, I am actively seeking postdoctoral positions that will allow me to further explore the realms of computational biomechanics, medical device design, functionally graded orthopaedic implants, and 3D printing of orthopaedic implants. I am interested in opportunities that involve finite element modeling and multi-criteria decision-making.

I would be grateful for any recommendations on institutions, research groups, or individuals who are leading the way in these fields at JHU. Additionally, any advice on the application process or emerging areas of research would be highly valued.

Thank you for your guidance and support in this pivotal phase of my career!"

I just accepted my offer to JHU for the applied math and stats PhD program.

Firstly, a lot of my research interests lean closer to stochastic processes/modeling, bayesian stats, and machine learning. During my visit, it was obvious that many professors were skilled mathematicians, but noticeably few specialized in statistics. Does this program lean more toward applied math than applied statistics or are there just fewer people labeled ""statisticians""? Do you have any tips on prepping for the introductory exams? I feel very good about probability, but my real analysis and linear algebra need some work. What has it been like getting jobs/internships after graduating with your degree? Also, are there any professors you'd suggest avoiding (either as advisors or course instructors)?

Also, where should I be looking for off-campus housing? During my visit, many of the current student recommended staying in the northern region of the campus when search for housing, but no one really explained where to be searching? Were you able to find suitable housing through sites like Zillow, [Apartments.com](https://Apartments.com), Realtor, etc? What is a realistic price to be expecting to pay for rent+utilities? Im hoping to live alone for year 1 then find roommates later rather than getting roommates Im not comfortable with.

Rent is 950 per month including utilities. I am willing to negotiate a little bit; I understand the difficulty with summer housing in general.

For safety and avoiding scams, I will be verifying by either JHED or other valid ID, and will do so myself as well.

Raising Credit Limit Before Registration?,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1bze493/raising_credit_limit_before_registration/,2,4,2024-04-09 00:15:45,"Hi, I'm a Hopkins freshman and I was planning on taking 20 credits in the fall next semester, but the credit limit is 19 credits. I asked my advisor if she could lift them, but she said that I would have to wait until my grades came out at the end of the semester to basically confirm whether I'm a good enough student to take that many credits next year. The thing is, registration is on April 19, before the semester ends, which means I would not be able to apply to one of the classes I wanted.

My advisor says that my credits would be lifted in the summer, and then I could get put on a waitlist for the course I want. To be honest, she's a bad advisor and really did not look like she knew what she was saying, so I don't really trust her. She also did not seem to really know how to lift credits, and she even forgot that we were supposed to have a meeting for spring registration. It also just doesn't make much sense that credits would be lifted after registration had since passed, so I was uncertain about the whole situation.

Basically, I just wanted to ask: ""To those who had to raise your credit limit, when could you get it done? Was it before registration? Did you have to wait for grades to come out? If it helps, I was on the Dean's List last semester."

M.Eng at CU Boulder vs MS in Electrical & Computer Eng at JHU's EP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1byj3ac/meng_at_cu_boulder_vs_ms_in_electrical_computer/,4,0,2024-04-07 23:41:01,"I was excited about getting the offer to study at JHU's Engineering for Professional. About a week ago, I got a letter from my home institution that they've accepted my application for the M.Eng program for Electrical Engineering. The only caveat with the M.Eng is not all classes are offered online so I will have to make arrangements with my employer for some off time.

I'm curious to know if the curriculum and the networking is better than what you would find from a really good state university. At Boulder, I was thinking about taking coursework in Power Electronics and Embedded Systems. Some of those classes can be offered online but it is not guarantee. I would also be able to keep my student license of Altium and design as many PCBs as I want. I don't know if it makes sense to take 4 courses there and transfer those to JHU because that is already 40% of the coursework.

I'm having a hard time making a decision. For costs, Boulder would be cheaper. The downside is that not everything is offered online. While JHU's EP is a recognized brand, they've been doing online education for over 20 years. At Boulder, the online classes are recordings of the same lectures though not sure about the video quality and care for online students. I'm confident that JHU's EP cares a lot about their online students. "

I was recently admitted for undergrad comp sci(hoping to minor in robotics, also interested in AI) and I have some questions. For context, I do not know yet if I want to work in CS for the medical field or not. I haven't really thought of it. 

1. How easy or hard is it to get an AI or robotics research project outside of biology or medical? 
2. This may be a stupid question, but are there times in which, for a non-biology related CS or eng. course, it would be helpful to know some biology? Like do they ever use examples or do projects which require background knowledge in biology?
3. For alumni who do, in JHU, did only research on AI or robotics related to medical, but applied for jobs outside of the medical field --- did your research cause hirers to consider you only a ""medical technology"" person? I'm told that for undergrad research, it doesn't matter too much which field the robotics project is in --- is this true? 
4. I'm going to be commuting as a freshman. Is there any advice you have for me for making friends? Like maybe any programs or something? 
5. I've been trying to do robotics demonstrations at schools with a relatively high proportion of students from economically-disadvantaged backgrounds. However, I also want to be safe.

Somethings to Consider Before Asking Reddit What College You Should Go To,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1bssuk4/somethings_to_consider_before_asking_reddit_what/,39,2,2024-04-01 02:57:06,"Been seeing a lot of posts with recently admitted students asking advice about which schools they should choose. First, I want to offer congrats to each and everyone of you. Getting into JHU is a feat in and of itself and you should be very proud of everything you have accomplished.

&#x200B;

But, I want to provide some insight about what you should be thinking about when you make these posts. First, if all you're going to tell us is which schools you got into and how much money they will cost you, there isnt much we can do to help. Almost all of us can ONLY speak to our lived experience at JHU and therefore, cant just randomly compare it to other schools. Ask us specific questions. Think about what matters most to you for college. Is it location, social life, research opportunities,  etc. Giving us tangible things to respond to will make people more inclined to answer and we can directly address what you want to know. 

Second, if your only question is ""which will be better for me to get into med school, grad school, etc"". Im going to be honest, it doesnt matter a ton (unless a school has a direct matriculation program). All that matters is how successful you are over the next four years. The school you choose might impact your personal ability to succeed so that is something to consider. But coming to JHU wont inherently make you a more or less competitive applicant down the road.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps out and good luck to everyone making a decision right now."

 I got half tuition at usc and like the social life aspect more, but JHU is quite a bit better academically. However, I‘ve heard that JHU econ department is not that good and there’s grade deflation. 

I’m leaning toward USC bc it’s cheaper for me and I’m trying to go into law which prioritizes a high gpa. Usc is obviously way easier than Jhu but I’m worried that I’m going to miss key opportunities if I don’t go to JHU.

I'm aware GT's program is rated the highest, but where does this actually make a difference? JHU seems to have significantly less CS undergrads, which likely plays into their ""lower"" rating. I have some preferences about where I go, but I don't want to bias your takes. From what you have seen, how is the teaching, class sizes, and difficulty at JHU CS? Even if the program is smaller, how does the quality compare? Also, how is internship accessibility at JHU CS?

JHU vs. UCLA,https://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/1bsu7k1/jhu_vs_ucla/,0,20,2024-04-01 04:08:15,"I’m a senior currently deciding between these two schools as someone going into psychology for sure, but likely also pursuing a pre-med track (maybe doing neuroscience)!

I’ll start off by saying that I’m an international student from Canada paying full tuition, and am extremely extremely grateful that tuition isn’t a consideration for me. 

I know that UCLA is ranked pretty high for their psychology major, but considering that I’m likely going into medicine too, I feel like JHU might provide me with more opportunities for that (research, internships, etc.), but how competitive is it?

Also, I’m looking for a work hard play hard type of environment, and I’m hoping to learn more about the general social environment at JHU and whether or not people are competitive! UCLA obviously has a big sports type of environment that I think would be fun, but I think as long as there’s still a good balance at JHU between school and going out/having fun, that’ll be enough for me. 

Finally, I’ve heard about grade deflation at both schools, but more so for JHU. How is it, really? Is it still possible to maintain a high GPA, even if I end up doing neuroscience? How is the academic support to help ensure student success? 

I’m actually losing sleep over this because everyone around me perceives JHU as more prestigious, but I’m more so thinking about the life I’ll have there versus UCLA during those four years!

One more thing (sorry): when I visited LA, it was not walkable almost at all… how is that in Baltimore? Is it easy to get around with just public transit, and most of all, is it safe?

THANK YOU AND PLEASE IF YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT PLEASE I WOULD REALLY REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE IT!!!"

I’m extremely grateful and fortunate to be in the position that I’m in, but I’m having difficulty choosing colleges, and was hoping to gain some perspective on the options I’m considering. 

For context: I’m planning to pursue an MD/PhD after undergrad, majoring in biomedical engineering, and I’m very interested in medical research. I do not qualify for need-based financial aid. 

My main consideration right now is whether it is worth to spend around $80k/ year (Yale, JHU, MIT) for a top-notch biomedical engineering/premed program, or instead opt for a full-ride to UVA as a Jefferson scholar, which comes with a lot of additional benefits (funded study abroad, strong alum connections, priority registration, stipend) but not as strong a BME research/premed program.

reading around a little it seems really minimal? there’s a lot of stereotypes about jhu students doing nothing but studying all day. i’m totally down for some solid studying but i also am hoping for something more than textbooks and lectures 24/7. 

i’m not looking for a party culture per say but i do love going to sports games and going out on the weekends and just hanging out with people casually. is that a big thing at hopkins or are the stereotypes true?

is the school spirit high? are the depression rates really as bad as people speak about? or is it more of a ‘you’ll find what you’re looking for’ type of thing?

Here are some interesting things/trends that I noticed: 

-Out of approximately 180 employers that showed up to either the virtual or in-person Future Fest, the majority were related to either research/academia or finance/consulting 

-Approximately 40% of undergraduate engineering students go to grad school 

-Also, looking at LinkedIn profiles of students, I noticed that many do research with labs instead of internships in the industry

I have some questions after looking at these things:

1) First, is research/academia so prevalent here because students specifically decided to attend to pursue these interests or is it because the recruitment is weaker than at other similarly-ranked institutions? 

2) Second, would an engineering student at Hopkins be able to find as many opportunities for career development as students in other similar colleges? 

3) Third, I also got accepted to Vanderbilt and Notre Dame, but I’m heavily leaning towards Hopkins, so is there anything that you wish you knew while considering different schools?

I live in New York, so Cornell is about one and a half hour drive from me while John Hopkins is almost 6 hours away. I really need help. Deciding on which school is superior to the other. Cornell has the ivy prestige and is closer to home while having a much larger student body and I would say a prettier campus. it is also a nicer city than Baltimore, my opinion, much more safe, and has a similar vibe to where I grew up and am living right now. John Hopkins is more renowned for its medical education which might bring it over the edge against Cornell.
