So i am in a group of three, two of us are rising juniors(currently sophomores) and another is basically a super senior. 

The senior is already in a rams but will only be able to bring in 1 of us due to other people in his current housing arrangement. Do we do that and one of the sophomores gambles to get a single in one of the rams. 

Or, do we all group up with the senior and pray to the lottery system and housing system that there will be 3 open shared singles in rams. 

So summary:   
  
A) one of the sophomores joins the senior and hope the other sophomore gets a single in one of the rams. 

Or

B) have a higher priority status and gamble with probably having less chance at getting 3 spots open but being able to choose earlier. 

Which one would be more feasible and safer? Thoughts?"

Cannot be done after 3pm on Saturday. Here are some specifics that will hopefully help you if you're not sure where to start:

The closest early voting site to campus is Chapel of the Cross on East Franklin, across the lot from the Planetarium. 304 E. Franklin St -- [all early voting sites in Chapel Hill/Orange County](https://www.orangecountync.gov/3013/Early-Voting-Wait-Time-Tracker) are open Friday from 8am to 7:30pm and Saturday from 8am to 3pm.

Bring proof of residence with you -- if you live on campus, UNC has already provided the county with your address, so your physical (not mobile) OneCard is proof enough! Otherwise, a utility bill, bank statement, or [anything else listed here will work as proof of residence.](https://www.ncsbe.gov/registering/how-register/register-person-during-early-voting) Also bring an ID -- a physical OneCard will also work for this! If you don't have a physical UNC OneCard, [these will also work.](https://www.ncsbe.gov/voting/voter-id#acceptable)

You can just show up at an early voting site (again, before Saturday at 3pm) and tell the election worker at the check-in station that you'd like to same-day register and vote. You'll be guided to the help desk, and an election official will guide you through the process. After you're registered, you can immediately turn around and vote!

Consider going tomorrow; if something goes wrong, you can go back on Saturday before 3pm and fix it!

Hope this helps -- Happy Halloween!"

 I pretty much need to take a math course every semester if I want to graduate by 2026, so I cant change that.

The room + apartment is fully furnished, I will take down decor/personal items so you can make the room how you would like! Apartment has a washer/dryer, dishwasher, air fryer, microwave, oven, and Roku.   
  
The space is incredibly peaceful. We have huge windows that let in a lot of light and have a great view of the forest. Private front porch with a couch and chair to watch the birds. The brick floors are beautiful, and you can often find Clementine stretched out on them.

Hi,I‚Äôm in MATH 130 this semester, and I‚Äôve been having trouble retaining most of the concepts, despite repeatedly going to peer tutoring sessions. I got a 65 on my first exam, which, according to Canvas, brought my overall grade to a B+ in the class. I knew the exam grade wasn‚Äôt great, but I figured that since it didn‚Äôt affect my overall grade too badly (according to Canvas), I was still doing fine.
For my latest exam, I did a lot worse, and Canvas showed my grade dropping to a C+. After this, I decided to use a grade calculator to figure out what I‚Äôd need on the next exam and the final to get at least a B grade in the course. However, when I input the grade distribution from the syllabus and my current grades, the calculator showed that I actually have a 52 in the class‚Äîan F‚Äînot a C+ like Canvas shows.
Now I‚Äôm panicking. I had assumed that the Canvas grade reflected the syllabus grade distribution accurately, as it does for all my other classes, and there‚Äôs been nothing(!!) in the syllabus or announcements from my Instructor indicating otherwise. I feel like an idiot. Looking back, I realize the exams should‚Äôve lowered my grade more, but I didn‚Äôt catch it. I would have gotten more help sooner if I‚Äôd known I was on the brink of failing.
This course is required for the major I want to apply for (Biostats), so I cannot fail. The last date to withdraw or switch to pass/fail is Friday, but my Instructor‚Äôs office hours for the week have already passed, so I can‚Äôt discuss this with him before the deadline. I‚Äôm really not sure what to do.
I‚Äôd appreciate any advice anyone has on this.

TL;DR: Canvas said I was passing, but I just found out I‚Äôm actually failing. Advice needed."

UNC MATH Spring '25 recommendations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/1g9jiuk/unc_math_spring_25_recommendations/,3,6,2024-10-22 14:30:23,"Hey guys, I'm a comp sci/math junior at UNC and I'm having a kind of difficult time deciding what I want to take math-wise in the spring. I know there's a 590 for machine learning that I'm probably going to take, but I want to load up on some more math courses as I feel like my UNC time has been pretty heavily CS-weighted and I haven't had enough time to explore many interesting math courses.

  
I took 347 last spring with Rimanyi and personally didn't like it much at all‚ÄîI had Rimanyi for a previous course (233) and really enjoyed it, so I figured that it was the class that I didn't like. However recently I considered that maybe I liked 233 because I took it in my first semester at UNC and my courseload was quite easy, I could skip the lectures and still ace the midterms, already knew most of the content before-hand, etc. and maybe I just didn't like 347 because of Rimanyi's teaching style. So I've thought about maybe trying to take 577 since I've heard having a comprehensive understanding of lin alg is pretty crucial. But I'd also like to take a few other classes that are just fun/interesting‚ÄîI really, really enjoyed MATH523 for reference, even though I didn't get an A in it or anything. That is to say, I'd rather take a hard, interesting class and get a B than take an easy, boring class and get an A. All recommendations welcome. Thanks"

Contest: Predict the 2024 Election - Compete with UNC Students & Alumni!,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/1g6rl3n/contest_predict_the_2024_election_compete_with/,1,0,2024-10-18 20:14:32,"Hey all,

With the 2024 presidential election approaching, I wanted to share a project that‚Äôs aimed at raising awareness and encouraging more people to get out and vote. It‚Äôs called¬†[Presidential Pick'em](https://presidentialpickem.com/), and it allows you to predict the outcome of the election by filling out your own electoral map.

It‚Äôs a fun way to get people thinking about the election while also contributing to some crowdsourced data. The goal is to compare predictions to actual results and hopefully spark more engagement in the election process, particularly since North Carolina is a critical swing state this election.

Each prediction will be scored based on how accurate it was and the results will be displayed on a global leaderboard. You can also create and join pools to challenge friends, roommates, or other groups.

I've created a pool specifically for students and alumni from UNC to join and compete against each other.

I started teaching for Kaplan in 2002 while I was applying to law school and after graduation I moved to NYC where I took a full time job as the national LSAT Product Manager for Kaplan - I have over 20 years of experience as a LSAT teacher and tutor, much of it full time.  I'm admitted to the bar in NY and NC (moved back in 2010) and currently do LSAT tutoring and bar exam prep.

Without too many boring details, I'm offering tutoring sessions at a much lower rate than what you'll pay if you go through a big prep company - with way more experience, no need to buy a huge package of hours, etc - I know the LSAT inside and out, have written countless explanations, designed and revised courses, etc.  I'd go head to head with anyone else around in terms of my knowledge and understanding of the course, and I've worked with many thousands of students over the years.  My approach is to work smarter, not harder, on what is a very learnable skills test.

I'm currently offering remote (preferred) and in-person tutoring.  My base rate is $75/hour for a two hour session, and I generally work between 12 and 6 pm, Tuesday-Saturday.  Remote is over FaceTime or Google Meets, and in person is generally at a Starbucks or similar location around the Southpoint area (I usually don't travel, so I can spend my time tutoring instead of in the car, but this could be negotiated if need be).

So, my question is if you think I would be OK taking 18 credit hours next semester to catch up? Or would I drown under the work load. 

I know all classes and profs have different work loads but I assume if all 4 of my classes are this light then the 6 I plan to take in the spring can't be too too much worse. Right?

Thanks!

ETA: She wants to major in Communications but with a focus on film and television. She writes screenplays and is interested in the production side of the film business, so will probably choose a related minor, as well as internships in the film industry. We noticed that the Dept. of Communication has a Hollywood Internship Program, so that's pretty exciting. She's also looking at NC State. We visited UNC-W and didn't get a great vibe about it.

I'm a neuro major with a very low GPA (think \~2.5) and I don't really have anything on my resume other than some volunteering unrelated to my field of study. I was very low achieving in the first 2 years here due to mental health issues and the whole nine yards and since I got so behind I was unable to get any lab/research positions last year and this year. I've combed all the databases, I've cold emailed professors, I've gone to career fairs, etc. Point is at this point I've essentially got 0 chance of getting a position, and grad school is unlikely. I'm completely aware I've done this to myself and not looking for a handout, but I came in to UNC with a vague idea of wanting to be a neuro major before my life took a nosedive. But now, I'm locked in to the major with only a semester left to go and outside of research/grad school, I don't really have any options between those two. I've finally gotten my ducks in a row and I'm willing to do anything at this point that will give me some semblance of a career that I can use my major for - I'm honestly just not sure what that is and if any of you have any ideas of where to go/what to do in this type of situation I would be infinitely grateful."

r/UNC is looking for NEW MODS!,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/1fq3700/runc_is_looking_for_new_mods/,26,1,2024-09-26 18:25:22,"Hey there everyone! We are looking for new moderators again :) Many of us, including myself, have graduated and are looking to pass the torch. Credit to r/okaybutfirstcoffee because I'm copy/pasting a lot of their recruitment post.

*We would particularly love some first or second year students, since every year the new student process/experience changes and evolves. Still super happy to have juniors or seniors, though!*

**What We Do**  
We're a very hands-off mod team when it comes to like...actual moderation. For the most part, we prefer to let folks get downvoted into oblivion rather than create an echo chamber. That's probably why you might recognize a few unsavory commenters in this sub: being just generally cringey or annoying isn't against the rules.  
  
To mod here, you need to have a really good understanding of nuance: for example, there's a difference between ""go to hell Dook"" or having a respectful political debate, and telling someone to kill themselves. We try to keep our mod team as just a useful group of folks who answer questions, participate in discussions, **remove chance-me posts and block spammers** (this is the biggest part of the job), and delete truly gruesome comments if we see them pop up.

This a largely low time commitment role, but you will need to be available for moments when UNC makes headlines. For instance, when we got to the final round of the NCAA (is that right acronym?) tournament a couple years ago, we were flooded with ticket scammers. We had to implement some protocols to keep students safe in that instance. Sometimes we make headlines for political and emotionally-charged reasons. When that happens, we often get flooded with trolls that are not a part of the UNC community whatsoever and have only come here to rage-bait and spew hatred. A lot of mutes/bans/etc are required during those times.

**To Apply**

First of all: be an active participant in¬†[](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/). Don't be like ""I am active a lot on my alt account"" or ""I'll be active as a mod."" I've removed mods from the mod team before because they went radio silent after a month or so. Being active is important.

Next, please let us know what you do at Carolina, what you like about it, what you don't like, whatever floats your boat. You do have to really enjoy being at Carolina to be a mod. Does that create a litttttle bit of an echo chamber? Maybe. But like what on earth do you want to be a mod for if you don't like being here? It's not like you work at Starbucks but don't like coffee, because we're not paying you. This is all volunteeeeeer/work fo free. So you gotta enjoy it.

**Send us a mod mail** with some stuff about you, if you have any experience modding (not necessary at all, since we again are very hands-off), why you want to be a mod, what year you are at UNC (non-traditional students are welcomed!) or anything else. If you don't know how to send a mod mail or it's weird on mobile, you can shoot it off to my DMs and I'll put it on our group chat (which you will get to be a part of! where we share our¬†^(\*GASP\*)¬†real names!).

**Comment or DM with any questions. We're excited to bring some new heels on board to the**¬†[](https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/)¬†**mod team**"

I took that to mean that these were unserious, frivolous books, and that there are plenty of better books out there, and that I should feel bad for enjoying them.

Does the library system let alumni use their database for research or to check out e-books? Can we still use office for free? 

Any benefits that alumni use on a daily basis whether it is for work/daily life?

Right now two of my five courses are being held by Data Science, Korean and Japanese. Basically, I self taught myself Korean to KOR 204 and am on track to KOR 306. But I realized I have no reason to study Korean since I won't move there and I have lost all love for the language since most of the Koreans at UNC don't speak to foreigners. The country is gonna collapse and I don't want to live in that stressful society small country etc. I picked up Japanese because of contacts and whatnot I have in Japan and the society is much more ideal for me. 

Anyways, I'm about 3-4 courses left with Global Studies and I'm 6-8 courses left with Data Science. Should I just throw Korean away and focus on finishing these two?

Or should I switch GS to like Japanese or Asian Studies?

I studied 3 days and 2 nights with no sleep last weekend. We are not told on tests how many points each question will be worth, because it depends on how everyone does on it. 

There are also questions based on other questions, meaning if you get 1 wrong you get 5 others wrong that use the same solution for that question to answer those parts in a domino effect. Instead the blame is placed on the class for not studying hard enough when I overheard a lot of people around me frustrated by how hard they prepared for this. We were told ahead of time there will be no curve on any of them.

There are no zoom office hours for this class and there is no piazza, so if you have a short question you have to walk to the other side of campus and physically go to office hours since its the only way to go to them. This is not accessible to people who live off campus, live on the other side of campus, and work outside of class.

I need this class to graduate and I work 25 hours a week outside of this class because otherwise I wouldn't even be able to afford to enroll or buy groceries. I also have a full-time job offer that took me 6 months to land in my field and it is contingent on if I graduate this semester. I have nothing to go back to at home and if I don't get the grade I need in this class I will be unable to afford to retake it another semester because its the last semester I am eligible for financial aid (previously was doing a double major, transferred in a lot of credits). It is also my last term in residence left and I am in over 40k of student loan debt.

Physically I am pushing myself as hard as I can. I do not know how I am supposed to prepare for a test where if I get 1 question wrong I will miss a handful of follow up questions worth a significant chunk of the grade on it. Between going to all my classes, working, and completing assignments, I have roughly 1 hour of free time in the evenings if I am lucky. I don't have time to walk to the other side of campus every day for office hours and there is no other way to ask questions outside of this class.

Given that several people already failed the first test, at what point is a class too ""challenging"" to the point it is harmful to the students? I am not here to do a thesis on this material and I just need it to graduate. I feel sleep deprived and angry because I genuinely am trying in this class and am already failing it. I understand the desire to push students but at what point is it too much especially in a class that people need for a graduation requirement. "

for reference, i've only ever lived in chicagoland. i'm currently at northwestern for undergrad, which has been nice for certain things (public transportation, food, beach, weather kinda lol) and not so nice for others (cost of living/housing, parking). i'm excited for change but also would like to know what i'd be getting into. thanks!"

Edit: Thank you all so much for the feedback, advice and resources.  We were already aware it's a reach but maybe not extent of the reach, so that is helpful info. My senior has a pretty extrordinary story of overcoming obstacles during high school and plans to do their best to tell that story through essays and how that impacted their GPA, yet how they overcame the adversity by finding positions of student leadership and creating programs for other kids going through difficult stuff. If it doesn't happen this year and they really want to be a Tarheel, there's always transfering. I teach my kids to always shoot their shot and also come prepared with a backup option (or three) and you can't go wrong. Thanks everyone! "
