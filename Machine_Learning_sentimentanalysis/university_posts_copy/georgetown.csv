Greek Life,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetown/comments/1gslmea/greek_life/,3,2,2024-11-16 11:46:48,"Washed up alumnus here.

I saw in another post where a recent grad said that since Georgetown doesn't have a real Greek culture, that social life is moreso about the club culture.

I know that fraternities and sororities exist at Georgetown, whether the service and professional orgs, the BGLOs and LGLOs, or the NPCs and NICS founded more recently. (I know that Georgetown doesn't give access to benefits for Greek life, but that hasn't stopped students from forming chapters.)

My question is moreso this.... Does the strength of the club culture mean that Greek life is less competitive to join than on other campuses?  Or are they shaping up to be just as competitive as anything else?

Not trying to be messy, just don't know anyone else to ask."

What do you guys think of Georgetown in general? Like how are the people, food, etc. I'm not sure if I want to go if its too political there since its the capital.

Depending on how the chem program is I'm not sure if I would pick it compared to other colleges I'm applying to like Pitt and Drexel which are my top 2 prob. If its good, it would prob be somewhere in my top 3 as earlier is was one of my number 1s but now it moved down after going more into applying, programs, and that stuff in general. "

[SFS plans to establish SFS Asia-Pacific Initiative in Jakarta, Indonesia, a new branch of SFS operations in January 2025](https://sfs.georgetown.edu/academics/global-experience/exchange-programs/).

In addition to graduate-level and executive training initiatives, SFS Asia-Pacific Initiative also underpins an incoming visiting student program for Indonesian undergraduates to Georgetown University in collaboration with the Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards (IISMA).

The first program to be held here will be the [Executive Master in Diplomacy and International Affairs (EMDIA)](https://sfs.georgetown.edu/academics/executive-education/emdia-asia-pacific/), developed by Georgetown’s Asian Studies Program and Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, in close consultation with the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and the Ministry of Finance’s LPDP Scholarship Program.

Questions about Georgetown CCT program,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetown/comments/1fugi0z/questions_about_georgetown_cct_program/,1,0,2024-10-02 13:42:57,"Hey all,

I'm really curious about the Georgetown CCT Masters and wanted to get some insights from current students. I do ask a lot of questions so please bear with me, but I would really appreciate any feedback you could share. Thank you so much!!

• If I get accepted can I defer my acceptance by 1-2 years?

• Is it possible to complete the Master's in CCT within 2 years while also working full-time? (Are there evening classes to accomodate our schedules?) (I know there's a 3 year option for those who are working full-time, but I want to try and finish it within 2 years)

• I've seen a couple of articles/reviews that state that while CCT is interdisciplinary, most students tend to be more focused on tech policy (given Georgetown's location in DC). Are there other students who focus on other fields at CCT or are the majority concentrating on tech policy/international relations/government related fields?

• I want to focus on UI/UX Design, Advertising/Marketing/Strategy, Branding/Logo Design, Psychology, Event Planning/Communication, etc. during my time in CCT if I get accepted. Will I be able to take classes in these areas? (I've taken a look at the course offerings, and I like many of the classes, but I was wondering if there are others we would be able to take as well that would pertain to our interests)

• How competitive is the admissions process, and what are the undergrad GPA ranges that get in? Will I get in with a gpa in the 3.7s (on the lower end)?

• How common are scholarships (and what is the usual percentage range of the scholarships)? Would I be able to get a scholarship given my GPA?

• Are there a lot of long papers that need to be written for class assignments?

• Is having an interdisciplinary degree worth it and will it allow me to get jobs in any of the above fields that I mentioned?"

When I asked about it when trying to decide what program to attend I was told they wouldn’t even look at it until after I had started the program. 

I understand that I was taking a gamble about them transferring but the courses are very standard that any institution has and it felt that they met all the requirements listed on the website being I got at least a B and they were not used to satisfy a previous degree.
 
What was not stated anywhere was that you can’t transfer in credits that are similar to core courses since they want to make all students take the core courses and don’t want to give credit for the same course twice. It just feels like this is critical information they should put on their website and that they don’t since they probably know it would turn away good candidates for their program.

I got assigned Harbin as my dorm, on the eighth floor specifically. I checked out the floor plan on that “roomie” program, and there are bunk beds. It doesn’t look like I have the option or room to unbunk the beds, so I was wondering if anyone who has possibly been in that dorm could let me know if unbunking the beds is possible? My roommate and I are both kind of upset about the bunk beds. Also wondering if the desks are built in to the wall or able to be moved around.
Thank you!"

I am 22 male, and my budget is around $1500 a month. I do prefer to keep my living place tidy and neat. I am quiet most of the time but also open to socializing and making friends!

Ideally, I wish the place is within 30 minutes of public transportation from my work place, but I am still open to places farther than that.

Please DM me if you are looking for a subleaser! 

Thank you!"

External Transfer --> Internal Transfer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetown/comments/1d6g6rx/external_transfer_internal_transfer/,5,4,2024-06-02 15:45:50,"Hello all! I was very recently (a day ago!) admitted to Georgetown as a sophomore transfer student. I was admitted to CAS as an econ major but since applying, have had a change of heart and am more interested in studying finance. Finance is in MSB, so I realize this is (unfortunately) more complicated than just changing majors.  
I'm wondering if external transfer students are permitted to apply to internally transfer schools. I understand that MSB transfer can be competitive but I was wondering if it's allowed! Thanks in advance :)

To clarify, I have asked the university this directly and am waiting to hear back. I'm unsure of when they'll get back so I thought I'd ask here in the meanwhile to see if anyone has any experience with this!

EDIT: I understand I would have to wait for a year in CAS before I could apply, as is stated on MSB's website. But as far as I understand, unless there's any specific rule saying external transfers cannot, I could apply to transfer to MSB at the end of the spring semester?

As the title says, I've been accepted into Georgetown University for the fall. I received a 2 course tuition aid package that will cover about 20% of my tuition. This leaves me with 50-60k, maybe more unpaid. I'm certain the university will point me towards student loans, but 60k is a lot to take on for one year. I've been looking at external scholarships, grants, and any free funding available, but sadly I missed most deadlines since applicants had to apply anywhere from 6 months to 2 years ahead of time. Additionally, I don't know where to look since most scholarship sites wants students already enrolled or cater to high school seniors and undergraduate students. My master's degree is in History. I focus on East Asian studies and will do intensive language training in either Japanese or Korean, most likely Japanese while at Georgetown. Thankfully, language courses are free for grad students. I can possibly get a TA while at Gtown, but it will only give me 5-6k per semester. What should I do? It's an amazing opportunity, especially for someone with my background plus I feel there is a higher chance for internships and jobs while in Washington, DC. What are my options?

Currently a Junior at a University here in Washington D.C. I am interested in transferring to the SCS.

But I have aspirations beyond undergraduate education. I was wondering what the impact would be getting a degree from SCS for an MBA, law school, or the like. Although the SCS is apart of Georgetown, would I essentially be ruined for future academic opportunities such as the ones listed above?

1). don’t have US citizenship and am worried about job/internship prospects for international students. Is there any discrimination for opportunities (I’ve heard internships especially the policy consulting/finance ones depends on the clubs u join) and does Georgetown do a good job helping international students with work visas etc. I'm Canadian so any Canadian students please help!

2). Georgetown seems to have such a low endowment compared to peer schools :(( besides the nonexistent financial aid, does the low endowment affect the quality of professors from ur experience and also campus resources available? Heard the facilities/food is often questionable. Is it getting any better?

3). In terms of reputation, how does Georgetown compare with Top 20s in terms of law school applications and just in general? Compared to a school with more selectivity (say, Vanderbilt), would a Georgetown degree be disadvantaged?

4). I'm currently accepted to Georgetown college. If I am interested in a double major/minor in business, would it be feasible to stay in college instead of transferring to MSB in terms of IB/consulting prospects?

The school I'm currently at isn't quite meeting my expectations academically or socially, and I'm yearning for a change of scenery and a fresh start. However, I don't want to jump into anything blindly.

If you've ever transferred schools, I'd love to hear about your experience. What made you decide to transfer? How did you go about choosing the right school? Did the transfer process itself pose any unexpected challenges? And perhaps most importantly, do you feel like it was the right decision in the end?

Additionally, I'd love to hear about your experiences there too. What sets your school apart in terms of supporting and integrating transfer students into the community? 

Outside of transferring itself, how well do you like Georgetown, if at all? What is your favorite and least favorite part of it?

Any insights, tips, or words of wisdom you can offer would be immensely appreciated. Making this decision feels like a big step, and I want to make sure I'm as informed as possible before taking it.

UT Austin: 
Pros: 
- 2-3 hours from where my family lives, so I can visit often (we're very close knit)
- Obviously it's a full ride, so my tuition, books, housing, meal plan, insurance, and ""average"" UT Austin cost of living (toiletries, parking etc.) is covered plus a stipend that I can use for whatever I want
- I have plenty of friends going to UT, including my bf and probably my sister next year
- i am part of an honors society, so i have access to a huge, pretty prestigious network

Cons:
- I want to do poly sci, so it's not in a bad area for it, but it's definitely not DC
-  I feel I will regret turning down Gtown
- Much bigger environment, so more competition for niche internships and possibly less attention from professors and definitely more giant 50+ student classes
- The weather honestly and having to walk around in it
- Culture (even in honors society) is largely based around sporting events and socializing and I'm very much a nerd who enjoys hanging out at cafes and studying with people 
- Not sure I could make it to an ivy for grad school.

Georgetown:
Pros:
- Right in the middle of Washington D.C., literal best place for poly sci
- This was my dream school, idk how I managed to get in, I love the campus and culture so much, definitely centered around academics, which I love. 
- I got into Walsh SFS, which has huge connections to politics and alumni networks. 
- I have access to some of the best internships because of location
- School is small, only 1,700 per year, so the classes are super small and you know all your professors 
- I would meet a lot more people from different places, most are out of state and there's a lot of international students
- A lot of opportunities for study abroad 
- Apparently Walsh is a feeder to Harvard for grad school, which is one of my goals. 
- They gave me great aid, not free but only ~10k per year including housing and books and ""miscellaneous"". 

Cons:

- Financial aid could differ from year to year
- Not a full ride and will have some debt altho parents will pay for most of it
- I don't know anyone who is going to Gtown
- I wouldn't be able to visit my family as often, probably only during breaks and long weekends
- I feel like I'll regret turning down the full ride and basically being rich during college lol

I really need help, I need to commit to or decline the scholarship within the next 3 days, I've visited both campuses and though I loved Georgetown more, I also did like UT Austin, I could see myself being happy at both places, but idk which opportunity is better. The 10k isn't the biggest deal in the world, my parents could pay it, but it's still a full ride with a built in honors program I'd be declining or my dream school. "

EHLS Program Scholarship ,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetown/comments/1c2o71j/ehls_program_scholarship/,2,0,2024-04-12 23:56:13,"Hi all.

I am a professional engineer working at one of the Big 3 American automotive OEMs, with a PhD in mechanical engineering. 

I was recently invited to apply for the 8-month EHLS Program Scholarship, taught at Georgetown. https://www.ehlsprogram.org/

Looking at the website, I am slightly confused by the program and it's benefits to me. On one hand, it feels like a very exclusive cohort; sponsored by D. of Defense, requiring strong English and a critical native language to enroll. I feel like it would be a good way to jump into federal contractors or even federal agencies. On the other hand, it feels like simply an English language course? The forced one-year employment at a federal agency is also very strange. For the right person it would be beneficial. However, it just gives me a feeling of a fancy job placement program for certain bilingual people. I guess if you're trying to jump into federal jobs or politics this would be a good avenue?

The requirements are quite strict, such as not having a job whilst doing this program. I would be potentially giving up (or pausing) a great career in the automotive industry for something that has unknown quantity. Speaking with my contact, I was told federal jobs just don't pay a lot. So I could potentially be seeing a pay cut after all this too. 

Can anyone shed some light on the program, or benefits I'm not seeing? I'd also really appreciate any perspectives on this, or any opinions on this at all.

* **Get out of campus as often as you can.** The “Georgetown bubble” is extremely real and more constraining than you think, and the one thing I can never recommend enough is to get out into the city as much as you can. That doesn’t mean walking around the Georgetown or Foggy Bottom neighborhoods - get dinner in Petworth with some friends, head out from Fort Totten to Rock Creek Park, explore all the cute streets in Columbia Heights, get a drink in NoMa or AdMo when you’re old enough. I can’t tell you how many students just never leave the Georgetown neighborhood and never experience the real city, and it’s honestly really sad. Given Georgetown's geography, you will have to make an active effort to make this work but it's more worth it than I'm able to describe. The best way to do this is to make friends off campus - there are a lot of cool people in the DMV and you shouldn’t miss out on them.
* On a similar note, **make an active effort to use the Metro.** There’s not a stop in Georgetown itself, but there are GUTS busses going directly to the Dupont and Rosslyn stations every 10-20 minutes. Do NOT Uber everywhere, it’s needlessly expensive and comes across to everyone outside of Georgetown as incredibly dorkish and sheltered.
* **Avoid a room facing Cooper Field** if at all possible. Their speakers are LOUD, they play the most repetitive god-awful music, they will wake you up early on weekends and you will hate it.
* **Don’t expect maintenance to solve many problems.** They famously take months to do basic repairs and you’re going to have to be creative if you want to solve a problem. Don’t wait on someone else to solve it for you, our maintenance and housing services are some of the most oppositional people you will ever come across.
* Club culture is incredibly exclusive and can feel detached sometimes, **definitely join clubs but don’t solely rely on them for social interaction**.
* **Go for internships early and in bulk.** You're competing with way more people than you think, and just having Georgetown on your resume won't do the trick. Start applying to Summer internships in Fall, and aim for at least 50 applications in month. You can use a baseline cover letter and just copy & paste the company name/position onto it. It's going to suck, it will suck the soul out of you but it's a competitive field and you're just gonna have to force yourself to do it.

Other Georgetown students, feel free to add on to any of this, these are just some of the first things that come to mind."
Georgetown or Duke?,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetown/comments/1bxqn6x/georgetown_or_duke/,1,9,2024-04-07 00:19:22,"Duke (Kunshan Campus)
Note: Duke has a dual degree program with wuhan university, it’s actually in China near Shanghai. I would prob study political economy.
Pros:
- 100% tuition scholarship, will need to pay abt $10k in housing
- Duke degree AND Wuhan degree
- Join Duke alumni association
- Duke degree+alum association would DEF help me get any job
- Can study abroad at main Duke campus in junior year
- Can brag about going to Duke??? (People literally put “Duke” on LinkedIn)
- I speak mandarin, I can practice there
- I am interested in international aspect of it
- Big city (Shanghai), cheap living
- Beautiful campus
- Drinking age is 18 lol
- I loovveee China I’ve always wanted to go there and I also have lived in various countries all over east Asia for 2+ years so I know what it’s like to live in Asia
- also more of a party school! but for clubbing, which is fine by me

Cons:
- I want the “American college life” (I never had the American high school experience, so I really wanted it for college. At DKU I would get it only for when I study abroad at Duke. Like there’s no frats, students in China tend to be more introverted, only “party” option is clubs/bars)
- I may regret turning down Georgetown…
- I won’t have the opportunity to network like in America
- It’s a new school, less structure, problems with admin and such
- REALLY hard to get internships (remote internships are my only option)
- Curriculum is pretty hard


Georgetown
Note: I was accepted into School of foreign service, I hope to dual sfs+busienss
Pros:
- I got so much fin aid literally only $700 a year
- AMAZING internship/networking/career building opportunities for pol sci/int rel
- Arguably most prestigious school for int rel
- Great study abroad/language programs 
- My career as a foreign service officer or whatever is pretty much set in stone. Like I’ll prob be able to have a stable job in that field.
- The schwarzman scholarship sounds appealing

Cons:
- I am still not 100% sure int rel/pol sci careers is what I want to do with my life yet
- Sfs+business dual degree is super hard to get into (like 20 ppl/year), I may not get in
- Am I going to regret missing my chance to get a Duke degree???
- A bit isolating campus, hard to get places, need a car?? (Expensive)
- Curriculum is super difficult, no grade inflation
- really pre-professional, people are very politically opinionated (I’m not, I’m afraid I wont “fit in” to the vibe there)
- I’ve heard the campus is really bad, facilities/amenities also horrible
- FOOD🤮🤮 (genuinely a big factor for me… food matters)
- Getting disability accommodations is hard
- Parties are horrible, not great/lively social scene, only clubs which need to be 21+ (only my senior year I will be 21😒)

TLDR: Georgetown is most boring/stable, DKU is the most new+exciting/unstable+risky"

Should I go to Georgetown SFS or Pomona for IR?,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetown/comments/1bt1l2d/should_i_go_to_georgetown_sfs_or_pomona_for_ir/,3,3,2024-04-01 11:47:09,"Should I go to Pomona for IR over Georgetown SFS?

Georgetown SFS or Pomona College?

Hi everyone! I just want to preface this by saying I'm genuinely stuck on which school to choose. I've done hours of research on both schools and here is what I took away as the most relevant for me.

(Some preliminary info) My dad doesn't want to make the decision for me or influence me, but he thinks Georgetown is a good decision and thinks the higher cost is worth it. I personally want to avoid spending so much and have as little to no debt after graduation as possible. I've been accepted to Georgetown SFS (\~$20k per year estimate) and Pomona College ($11k per year), as well as a few other schools like American SIS's Global Scholars Program, but I think my decision is left to these two schools. I also am thinking I will get an MA for International Relations.

GEORGETOWN PROS:

* SFS is #4 undergrad for IR, #1 masters
* DC location offers plenty (the best) of opportunity for internships (95% sfs majors get on avg. 3 internships; Pelosi scholars; applied learning labs; etc.)
* SFS has 8 different majors to branch off into (might want to do IPOL or STIA)
* 29k alumni
* Plenty of study abroad options
* Really nice campus w/ gothic architecture (my favorite)

GEORGETOWN CONS:

* preppy, stuck-up kids/culture? (""Georgetown bubble"")
* classic big research school negatives, like TAs & a more competitive environment for internships (& some popular clubs like the Hoya, the Corp, or Blue & Grey)
* $35k more in total (speculated from fin aid estimator because I haven't been sent my official net cost, but I can try to bring the cost down by being an RA or applying for more scholarships in college)
* DC is pretty expensive to live in

POMONA PROS:

* Liberal arts curriculum & culture which I typically prefer to research schools
* Probably better facilities to also pursue astro/physics than GU
* Can get very close to profs (no TAs) & better opportunity to conduct research 1-on-1 w/ them Oldenborg Center for learning languages
* $35k cheaper (guaranteed housing all 4 yrs & all the same cost for dorms, 1 meal plan that is just unlimited swipes)
* Access to Claremont Consortium (around same size undergrad population to GU)
* Other more insignificant things I like about Pomona's offerings
* Really nice, collaborative, happy students

POMONA CONS:

* Not in DC, so less easy access to internships
* Claremont suburb is nice but it's quiet & is 35 miles from LA
* Less strong IR program in comparison to GU, which is my main focus

I'm well aware that my pros are kind of skewed in Pomona's direction, but I did go to their fly-in program in the fall, so it's easier for me to list & remember pros for that school compared to GU. I haven't visited GU yet, but I will go to their open house in a few weeks, so I'm expecting to get more information than the few hours of research I did on their website. Overall, I know GU is probably way better for me to go to because of SFS, but I feel like Pomona carries a vibe that I would be more in-tune with."

On the other Hand Georgetown happens to be 86k per year. since our family income is around 350k with not alot of realestate or money saved and youngersiblings  we are in the unfortunate range where it looks like we are rich but we are not rich enough to pay GU full. despite this Im contemplating between these two schools but Georgetown had always been my dream school then i found out about Hoya Battalion Rotc program for nursing students. I have so many questions about them do they cover full tuition for me? is it 100% acceptance rate if i got into GU nursing? I really want to take an opportunity that will benefit the most.

1. This is directed more for alumni/those on the cusp of graduating: Did you feel as though completing your Master's at GU opened up doors that lower tiered universities would not have?
2. Will attending GU give my friend the opportunity to make connections that will give them a leg up in landing a post-grad job?
3. How are you all paying for tuition? $70k is a LOT, and they have not heard from the financial aid office about any scholarships.

I’m currently a first year at UNC studying neuroscience on the pre-med track. UNC is a great school but it’s just not for me (I don’t enjoy the campus, I’ve lived in NC for the majority of my life and want to go out of state, also I’m thinking of doing the biology of global health major, which UNC doesn’t offer). Georgetown is one of my top choices for transferring as I loved the campus when I visited and I have a family friend who absolutely loves going there, and I have a few questions I would love some input on. 

1) For all the pre-meds, how would you rate your experience at Georgetown? If you could redo your college decision would you choose Georgetown again for pre-med, or choose a different college? Also are there any benefits to being a pre-med in the school of health compared to being in the CAS? Both the college and SOH have majors that interest me, so if anyone has any input on their experience or unique benefits I would love to hear.

2) I would definitely be paying more in tuition at Georgetown compared to being in-state for UNC, would you say the experiences and opportunities at Georgetown are worth the tuition? (I’m unsure how much I would be paying at Georgetown, but currently at UNC I’m paying around $26k) Also how is the aid at Georgetown, do they often give somewhat generous amounts of aid? 

3) What are some unique things about Georgetown that other colleges don’t offer? I know Georgetown is a terrific school, but is there anything that truly sets it apart from other top schools?

Any input is much appreciated, I would love a greater perspective of Georgetown and its offerings to better compare Georgetown with UNC in my decision. Thanks :)"

Support the Georgetown Secular Society!,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetown/comments/17nvqqh/support_the_georgetown_secular_society/,0,40,2023-11-04 21:16:43,"Hello Hoyas:

The [Georgetown Secular Society](https://www.georgetownsecularsociety.com/) was founded in February 2023 to ameliorate Georgetown’s ongoing atonement for participating in the U.S. slave trade. Our mission is to realize a secular Georgetown, a proposal we substantiate in [our petition to the university’s governing body](https://www.georgetownsecularsociety.com/Petition.pdf). 

Secularization represents the fulfillment of Georgetown’s reconciliation initiative. Primary source documents establish that Georgetown’s administration understood slavery as ordained by God. A serious effort at self-improvement, therefore, would have reconciled Georgetown’s previous and present-day understanding of the Bible. The decision of Georgetown University’s Working Group to omit delineating the Bible's position on slavery from their final report was an egregious abandonment of their responsibility to the truth. The Bible explicitly endorses slavery. (For more information, please view Appendix 1 of our petition.)

Most importantly, the [deleterious influence of Georgetown’s Catholic and Jesuit identity continues today](https://www.georgetownsecularsociety.com/hoya_saxa). In April 2023, the Maryland Office of the Attorney General published an interim report of their investigation into child sex abuse in the Archdiocese of Baltimore—an institution fathered by Georgetown University’s father, John Carroll. ""From the 1940s through 2002, over a hundred priests and other Archdiocese personnel engaged in horrific and repeated abuse of the most vulnerable children in their communities while Archdiocese leadership looked the other way [...] Over 600 children are known to have been abused [...] but the number is likely far higher."" According to a recent investigation by *The Hoya*, 14 of Georgetown University’s religious leaders in recent history have been credibly or plausibly accused of sexual abuse. For many of these persons, the Society of Jesus possessed information of alleged abuse prior to their presence on Georgetown’s campus.

Our current priority is education and outreach. We would be humbled to receive your support in our movement to improve Georgetown University. You can help our organization in any of the following three ways:

**1. Spread awareness of the Georgetown Secular Society in your social circle:** The majority of Georgetown’s community is unaware we exist. Simply spreading our presence on Georgetown’s campus by either word of mouth or social media would bring our organization the momentum it requires for success.

**2. Join our network:** Are you active in any student or alumni groups? If so, please discuss having your organization endorse our mission. By joining as a coalition, we would represent a united front for a better Georgetown. 

**3. Write to Georgetown’s administration:** Are you concerned about racial reconciliation? Reproductive and LGBTQ civil liberties? The rise of pseudo-science and conspiracy thinking? Child sex abuse? A concise letter that states your reasons for supporting our movement pressures Georgetown’s administration to act on these issues now.

Thank you for your help! And I hope you will keep in touch with us as our organization develops!"

Georgetown Hoyas aren't exactly known for their racial diversity, and though Georgetown has had more white players in the past decade than in the previous 30 years, Georgetown is still seen as a ""Black"" team.

The last decade, we've had quite a few white players on our roster, and Nate Lubrick was credited as the guy who helped end the perception that white guys weren't welcome to Georgetown basketball. After Lubrick, we had Greg Malinowski, Turkish sensation Omer Yurtseven, and of course, White Iversion himself, Mac McClung!

Interestingly enough, given Georgetown's reputation in the international stage, I'm surprised we haven't recruited more Eastern European players or players from Spain to play for Georgetown. Our rival George Washington got tons of international players so GW's basketball teams always had much more of a diverse and international flavor.

Now we have six non-Black players on Georgetown's roster: four white guys, and one Middle Eastern player, and one Hispanic/Middle Eastern mixed player. The last time we had more than four non-Black players on Georgetown's roster was all the way back in 1980 (we have five white guys on that squad)."

One of the  RCs happened to pull the fire alarm on accident. Things happen, fine, but instead of coming clean and apologizing and moving on, she decides to sweep it under the rug. 

Now, let's say the fire alarm coincidentally went off as the RC was near it, fine.  In what I can only assume is a panic, she then proceeds to take aspiring students INTO THE ELEVATOR?! If this was a real fire 🔥 you're going to take the elevator? Really? Violation of protocol?! 

When  this misconduct comes to light, the Director and Associate director are receptive. As they should be. Just kidding, after 30 minutes, some tears, and some strategizing, THE STUDENTS HAVE TO APOLOGIZE AND RECEIVE PUNISHMENT?! In what world are people punished for reporting misconduct.

B.  International business langauge and culture under the school of arts and sciences (I love reading/writing/discussion and have done some liberal artsy things during my high school career but not as much as business)

So I might transfer within Georgetown from the college to SFS.

My question though is is there any big differences between Georgetown College's government/poli sci program and what the SFS program has? Hearing some pros/cons and some personal experiences might be helpful. My interests lies more in learning more about international affairs rather than internal affairs."

In SF, I live in Pac Heights and love that it’s a little more low-key and has access to great parks (Lafayette, Alta Plaza, Presidio). I have a dog and am a runner, so access to green space and trails is a huuuge plus for me. I also like proximity to places that have a little more going on… my current spot is only a few blocks from Polk street, which has my favorite bars, and it’s also super easy to get to Union St and Fillmore St (which are both very much my speed). 

Any recommendations for neighborhoods like this in DC? I’m a little older than the average law student: female, 30, single. Needs to be safe enough to run early in the morning solo, have proximity to good trails (ideally with good greenery), and proximity to fun areas with great bars/restaurants/nightlife.
