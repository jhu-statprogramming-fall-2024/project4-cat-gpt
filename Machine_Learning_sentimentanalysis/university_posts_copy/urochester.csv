Re: students getting arrested for poster protests,https://www.reddit.com/r/URochester/comments/1gvtyss/re_students_getting_arrested_for_poster_protests/,31,113,2024-11-20 16:49:22,"Recently graduated alum here, with some thoughts on the current discourse on student protests with regards to I/P conflict. While I firmly believe Israel (specifically Netanyahu) is acting in bad faith at this point in the conflict, targeting of faculty as “tools of genocide” is ineffective at best. I had enough issues with the environment on campus last year from the protests, it created a toxic environment where students felt suppressed in their beliefs, on both sides. But this is on another level where a student who may believe that Israel ought to at minimum exist is in fear of being targeted for being complicit in “genocide”. 

How should the university respond when the environment moves from activism to vindication?"

Why did the school feel the need to blatantly lie that the posters were explicitly Anti-Semitic?

There is quite frankly NO PROOF AT ALL that the people in the posters were targeted for their identity. Why is the school so hostile as to throw out an accusation of a Hate Crime without proof?

I am also afraid I won't have a lot of friends since I'm a transfer student. Since Everyone already knows each other. Can you also share about 1. What are your favourite parts of Rochester? 2. How strong are Rochester alums? 3. What kind of help will you give to students? 4. How will the carer service help students get a job?



Please give me some advice; thank you very much for your help and time!"
"TRUMP: My administration will inform every college president that, if you do not end antisemitic propaganda, they will lose their accreditation",https://x.com/JewsAreTheGOAT/status/1857233659423490547?t=w8ym_ptjz15Yg4LiyJ7emw&s=19,127,110,2024-11-15 12:48:52,
Discussion: Should Rochester's Pro-Palestinain Movement force Sarah Mangelsdorf to resign?,https://www.reddit.com/r/URochester/comments/1gsuc2y/discussion_should_rochesters_propalestinain/,0,9,2024-11-16 19:02:07,"When it comes to protests against the genocide in Gaza, those that complain that ""Yes, we hate the bloodshed, but protests just push people further right"", do not seem to understand that the right wing has handed the left a powerful weapon through their hysterical overreactions.

For the price of a few posters, the anti-genocide movement now has U of R president Sarah Mangelsdorf's ovaries in a vice.

The aggressive Zionist lobby, which intimidates Democrats and Republicans equally, has pursued naked McCarthyism against college presidents since the genocide began. To allow free speech on campus is to be put in their crosshairs, but to advocate for anything less than outright censorship of free speech will get you hauled before Congress and eventually compel your resignation, especially if you are a woman.

Witness the departure of Claudine Gay (Harvard), Liz Magill (UPenn) and Nemat Shafik (Columbia). The last example is especially amusing: Shafik unleashed the police on protesters and did everything but convert to Judaisim to appease the McCarthyites. No good.

Now, with Donald Trump using this postering incident as an excuse to declare all out war on campus free speech, and with the Democrats helpless to do anything but go along (you don't have to twist Chuck Schumer's arm, of course!), Mangelsdorf's goose is essentially cooked. She can ""clamp down"" on free speech all she wants-- her willingness to help the far right is exactly what led to the  posters.

All it will take is one more stroke of the sandpaper to make the far right (as well as the castrated liberals) declare that U of R is a ""hotbed of antisemitism"" and call for her head. She could be out by the end of the year.

On the other hand, Mangelsdorf could pledge her fidelity to free speech and actually become a hero, the first of these broads to actually score a win against the incoming Trump administration.

The question is: What should Rochester's pro-Palestine movement due to take advantage of this wonderful turn of events?"

The most important thing about those posters,https://www.reddit.com/r/URochester/comments/1gqvyiw/the_most_important_thing_about_those_posters/,0,50,2024-11-14 03:42:19,"The most important thing to remember when a protest catches the public's attention is that the people who are the target of the protest (invariably the powers that be) will instantly try to muddy the water and distract the audience from what the protest is actually about.

Therefor, you have seen Meredith Dragon of the Jewish Federation being given an unjustifiable amount of time on TV denouncing the posters as ""antisemitic""  because they draw uncomfortable attention to the reality of Israel's crimes,  which the Jewish Federation is paid to help spin to the American public.

This incident has even led to denunciation from Chuck Schumer, also a genocide advocate. (And boy, does he ever need to look like a man in charge after the ass-whooping the Democrats just received!)

And this is to say nothing of the blind, unquestioning slander against the protesters delivered by the media, who never step out of line where Israel is concerned.

The protesters who put up those posters are heroes, full stop. And the people they exposed do not feel fear, they feel **embarrassment** for being part of a gigantic crime that is the Gaza genocide.

The question we should all be asking right now is: How can we embarrass them MORE? What can we do to help make this protest bigger?"

I'm a rising high school senior who toured University of Rochester and loved it! I've done research on the school, but I still have a few questions:


How good is the CS program? I'm interested in CS and I've heard this school is good for STEM, but haven't heard about it standing out for CS in particular. Is it more theory based or more hands-on? Are the professors good? How is the job placement afterwards?

Do students often get internships, or co-ops? Is that a thing that is done often at this school or nah? I know it's not known for them like Northeastern is, but I'd like to get some hands-on experience in my field during my school years.

Follow-up on the internship/co-op question: For CS majors who have done internships/co-ops, how good is the city of Rochester for cs-related internships/co-ops? Is the city good with tech jobs/placements or are there only few opportunities there?

How welcoming is the student body to lgbtq students, especially to nonbinary and trans students? I got the vibe on the tour that the school is really lgbtq accepting, and my tour guide talked about it too, but I would like to hear more honest opinions just to be sure lol.

Is the campus/area safe? I've seen some negative reviews of the school online saying the school isn't safe and want to clarify if that's true or if reviews like that are a rarity.

How welcoming and helpful is the administration and faculty whenever you have an issue you need to bring up? This was another area I saw complaints online about.

Finally, how's the social life? I'm not talking huge parties (not my scene at all) but like is it easy or difficult to make friends and hang out with them around campus or the city or in dorms? Are people here generally friendly/collaborative or unfriendly/competitive? Is there a good enough work/life balance to set aside a decent amount of time with friends each week or is school work too all-consuming and stressful to maintain friendships?

Hey there! We’re two guys in our mid-20’s searching for a third roommate to move into our 3 Bed / 1 Bath apartment with us on August 14th. The lease is a month-to-month lease with a required 60-days notice of cancellation, so whether you’re a student or looking for more permanent housing, we have you covered! Rent is $1800 split evenly three ways at $600 per tenant, with a security deposit due by September 15th. Garbage, lawn care, snow removal, and water are included in the price of admission! We will be splitting the billing for any non-covered utilities (RG&E, Internet, whatever else we share) evenly.

The space itself is an apartment on the first floor of a house, located close to the college campuses (\~1 minute to UofR / \~5 minutes to RIT) and Downtown ROC (\~10 minutes). The apartment includes new kitchen appliances – Fridge, dishwasher, oven, microwave – and has central air. There is also a shared basement with a washer and dryer for laundry, so you won’t have to make any trips to the laundromat!

The apartment also includes off-street parking, a backyard, and a porch that we share with the upstairs tenants / landlord who we both personally know. The house is a 420-friendly space, but any tobacco smoking must be done outside (There’s plenty of space for it!).

The apartment comes unfurnished, so expect to furnish your room completely. Anything you bring that doesn’t end up being used can be stored in the basement. We have two couches, tables, chairs, additional appliances, some other random bits of furniture, and can discuss anything else that will be needed.

Some requirements to apply:

* 620 Minimum Credit Score
* \~$1800 monthly income
* Passing a background check as part of the application

We are both fairly busy people, but we pride ourselves on being easy-going and adaptable :) Whether you’re the type of person who wants to be pals or would rather be left to your own devices, there’s a place for you here! We would like to at least get to know you if you’re interested in applying though, so don’t be afraid to shoot us a message asking for more details/pictures/random fun facts/just to chat!"

Now, I want to focus on perfecting my applications for research assistant roles. My current plan is to spend the summer doing that because when the school year starts, I have to lock in :( I have a few questions:

1. What should I include in my cover letter to demonstrate my genuine interest in the position and make up for my lack of experience?
2. Would it be a good idea to email the professors beforehand to inquire about the details of their research projects? This way, I could tailor my application to better fit their requirements.

Since there is no general ed, do we immediately start taking the pre-req classes for our major? Also I plan to double major so what do I do in that case? Would I pick 1 major to start with and fufill those requirments then move onto the next or would I fulfill the major requirements for both simultaneously? In that case, since I would want to major in Neuroscience & Bioethics, would that meant I would only need a cluster in the social sciences?

I’m a high schooler who recently got into a BS/DO program with LECOM with Binghamton University. I have also been accepted to The University of Rochester. I’m happy with both of these acceptances, however, I have struggling to choose which school to commit to. I was wondering, as you are all experienced pre-meds, should I go the traditional route, or stick with the BS/DO.

**BS/DO:**

**Pro:**
- Only need to maintain 3.3 cGPA and 3.4 sGPA
- No MCAT
- 26k per year for undergrad and about
- 40k per year for med school
- Guaranteed reserved seat and matriculation so long as requirements met
- I’ve spoken with their current students and staff for their med school and it’s absolutely a wonderful environment
- PBL, could be a positive or negative

**Con:**
- DO is great, however, it does still limit my options in the future in comparison to MD
- Have to stick with one school
- Not the biggest fan of the undergrad Campus
- Water rule and dress attire? I don’t really mind this tbh since I’ll likely be doing something similar during residency
- Unable to apply out for med school
- Heard admin for undergrad and med isn’t always the most helpful, though could be true for all medical schools

**University of Rochester**

**Pro:**
- I received 3.5k research grant to use it on whatever I want research wise
- Beautiful campus. I loved the dorms and environment when I toured, though it was brief 
- Strong Pre-Med program and tons of resources
- Friendly undergrad environment and students
- Almost all students have a guaranteed opportunity to do research with a professor
- Top Undergrad with 36% acceptance rate
- Not much competition when choosing classes
- Potentially increase chance in matriculating to Med School which is highly ranked

**Cons:**
- 46k per year, 39k after Pell and Work study
- No guaranteed matriculation to medical school
- May risk having a lower GPA due to course difficulty which could result in gap years
- this is more my parents, but they worry that I’ll burnout for pre med and have to switch majors which UR is highly ranked in all aspects
- Few years ago, but supposedly sexual harassment allegations in neuro department

- rochester better campus feel vs case in city
- rochester better dorm and food
- rochester is better gender ratio
- both rochester and case are cold and gloomy !
- rochester has nice tunnel system to keep kids protected in winters
- rochester has better study abroad for CS options
- rochester has flexible curriculum vs case follows a set
- case gave her 26.5 per year vs rochester gave her 13 per year ; and we are cleveland based
- so case will be circa 18k cheaper per year even if stays in dorm in case


so : how is comp science rated at rochester? How do employers look at it? and  Grad schools? we hear case is academically very well known. How about Rochester ?

second, how are class sizes at rochester ? the intro classes (auditorium style) and then in junior or senior year; how are the sizes ? do kids get faculty time : TAs or Professors ? Are professors engaged with students or is it 2 hr a week office hrs and it takes months to see them?

On the one hand, Rochester has an open curriculum and plenty of math and physics courses that I can take, meaning I can really dive deep into all the material I find super interesting. Additionally they have an unbelievable emphasis on research, enough so that I can get 4 years of research on top of being able to take lots of graduate courses due to the open curriculum. As I want to go to grad school, this is crucial. At the same time, I worry about the weather and the overall environment of the school. I’ve always handled the cold and rain well, but I don’t want a dreary social environment. Similarly, I worry the people who go might be too academically driven, of course this is how I am, but I’d want an environment that’s more colorful than a bunch of  hard working kids. Lastly, I toured inside of the math and physics departments and they are abysmal, seemingly no personality with almost no posters or any real excitement that I would like to see. Then again I went on a Saturday.

For Boston college it is almost the opposite. I wont be able to pursue as in depth to my classes due to the tight curriculum, however then again the general philosophy of education there is something I appreciate much more- it may help me greatly to expand my perspectives and really engage with other subjects. The campus is lovely and the people seem more socially diverse and friendly. However I most specifically worry about the physics department, and the research opportunities all around, it seems a lot less accessible and sufficient compared to Rochester. 

Generally, I feel like at Rochester I will do better academically and be more able to pursue the subjects I’m very interested in. However at BC I also respect the overall social scene better as well as the required classes.

How small does the school feel in terms of the undergraduate classes? Are you running into new faces every so often, or do you feel as though you already know everyone?

University of Rochester is one of my top choices, but I have concerns. About 600 students have posted on the UofR ‘28 instagram account saying they are either likely going or 100% committed. Each undergraduate class is around 1500 students. And so, seeing the account makes me feel like I’ve already met 40% of my class. For some reason, this scares me.

Sure, I might feel this way about every college if I start viewing their respective instagram accounts. However, UofR is about half the size of the other schools that I’m considering, so this is a more important factor for this university in particular . I don’t want to feel as if I already know 40% of the faces I’m going to see. I want to explore but I’m afraid that at UofR, the amount of new experiences to be had will deplete quickly. The last thing that I want my college experience to be is monotonous.

U of Rochester comes down to 250K. Case Western comes down to 300K. I tried appealing for more scholarships from Case, but they said no. Should I try appealing for more from Rochester? State School comes down to 150K.

Where should I go? Should I swallow the bills from U of R (my parents can kind of afford that if we live frugally) or take loans and go to Case Western? Or should I go to my state school?

UofR vs. AU,https://www.reddit.com/r/URochester/comments/1bt7yj3/uofr_vs_au/,4,15,2024-04-01 16:16:54,"Hello! Not sure if this is the best place to be asking, but as the title suggests, I need help deciding between American University and UofR. I already asked A2C about which one I should choose and the people that responded seemed to lean towards AU, but I wanted to ask those that are attending UofR. 

Context: Hoping to become a legal prosecutor. ECs include club and varsity alpine racing, volunteer coaching for Special Olympics skiing, piano, and CEO of a CS nonprofit. 3.6 UW 4.0 W (extenuating circumstances…), 1520 SAT. 4 years of Honor Roll and volunteer awards, part of NHS. Preferred major is Legal Studies. 

To summarize what I think right now, UofR is way too expensive for what they offer; especially considering the fact that they gave me absolutely no financial aid, I can’t really justify paying $90+k per year. They only offer Legal Studies as a minor, so I’d be majoring in Political Science. I have a bunch of AP exams, but UofR doesn’t give credit for most of them. I have 4 credits right now, and if all of my exams go well this year, the maximum I can get is 16 credits. There probably wouldn’t be many career-related opportunities in that part of NY. Also the weather there is apparently just sad, all of the time. There are some pros: ranking-wise, UofR is T50 and T20 in Poli Sci. The S:F ratio is fairly low. There’s a lot of research (though it mostly revolves around STEM).

As for AU, I got the maximum residential scholarship of $22k a year (which I assume means I’m in the top 10% of AU’s ‘28 class), bringing down my CoA down to ~$57k. They do offer Legal Studies, so that’d be my major. Location is probably the best possible for career-related opportunities, and I might be able to graduate early because I’d be going in with 30 credits from my AP exams. I also heard AU is in a consortium with a bunch of nearby universities, including Georgetown and JHU. The only problems I’ve heard is that the administration doesn’t really care about the students and also AU isn’t T100 for best universities OR best value schools, so my ego feels a little bit hurt. AU, to my understanding, is well-known in the legal field though, so I’m not sure if I’m “right” to feel like I wouldn’t be challenged enough there.

&#x200B;

I got admission from the University of Rochester, Syracuse University, Michigan State University, and Rochester Institute of Technology for their MS in Data Science program for fall 2024.

&#x200B;

I went through the Fortune list of ""Best MS in Data Science for 2024"", which lists the University of Rochester as the 7th best university to pursue the MS in Data Science. However, I don't have any other sources which confirm the same.

Could anyone rank the aforementioned universities for MS in the DS program, and share your opinions? It's an open-ended question.

I was recently admitted to URoch with a $20k scholarship and $3,500 RIG (research grant). My family is low-income, so I’ll be able to attend the university for under $25-30k a year. This is in my budget, but other schools (like Binghamton) would be cheaper. I would appreciate any input you guys would be willing to give me.

- I am a prospective Health, Behavior, and Society major, but this might change. I have a passion for psychology, and my long-term goal is to become a holistic child psychologist, hopefully with a speciality in nutrition. I truly believe that a lot of society’s problems can be alleviated or decreased with investment in the mental health of our youth. I also believe that a child’s nutrition, home environment, exercise, and overall wellness has profound affects on their mental health. I plan on doing research at URoch in this field, and I am also attracted to their lack of a core curriculum. I feel as if I will be able to get a well-rounded education that satisfies all my interests.
- I also plan on continuing my studies in Italian and ASL. Would this be possible, or would it be too much to take on?
- I am dead-set on studying abroad, but I see that only 11% of students do so. Are the programs good? Bad? Expensive?
- I love traveling, so I hope to spend some time in Toronto. Is the train ride doable?
- Are the winters unbearable? I’m from Long Island so I’m used to the snow, but I’m assuming it’s worse in Rochester. I know there’s tunnels, but from my understanding there’s not too many?
- How is the food? I’m a pescatarian and I try to eat as healthy as possible.
- Is the city nice? I love to explore. I know it’s no Manhattan, but are there fun things to do? Cute cafes? 

If there’s any other information or guidance you have, please feel free to let me know. Thank you!"

Rutgers vs. U Rochester - Big Price Difference Worth It?,https://www.reddit.com/r/URochester/comments/1bonio3/rutgers_vs_u_rochester_big_price_difference_worth/,8,21,2024-03-27 00:00:17," 

Hey Reddit,

I'm facing a tough decision between Rutgers (my in-state school) and the University of Rochester (URochester).  URochester was my top choice because I've heard it's a fantastic research university, which is a big draw for me since I'm interested in applied math with a focus on finance.

**The Money Factor:**

The major hurdle is the cost.  Rutgers, being my in-state school, comes with a scholarship, making it significantly cheaper.  URochester, on the other hand, hasn't offered me any financial aid.  The cost difference is over $60,000!

**My Questions:**

* **Is the extra cost for URochester worth it for applied math (finance)?** Would the education and potential career opportunities be significantly better than at Rutgers?
* **Does URochester's research focus truly translate into a major advantage for someone in my field?**

**Any Advice Appreciated!**

I'm really torn on this one.  Any insights from current students, alumni, or anyone familiar with these programs would be a huge help!

Thanks in advance!"

I am from nyc and im considering going back to school for nursing. I want to hear about current/ past students of the program and ask about your experience and if its worth the expensive tuition . Also im not sure about housing if i want to dorm or rent student off campus places (like: the marshall, the lodge, park point, the province etc). (i dont think i can share a bathroom with strangers and ideally would like to bring my cat with me) The reviews about off campus places are mixed and can be pricey and a lot of them are more advertised to RIT students. U of R gives a website Places4students to look for off campus housing as well but i havent looked into it too deep.

I do prefer the 24 month option since i would not have financial support from family (so i would have to work to pay for housing and living expenses) and would prefer a slower learning curriculum. however, ive read on the UofR site that their 12 month ABSN program has a option for tuition reimbursement if you work for their hospital for 3 years post graduation, no debt sounds great but i dont think i can handle that.  
There are many ABSN programs in nyc but a big part of me wants to experience the 'out of my hometown' college experience and experience living on my own. I also did research on some SUNY ABSN options but theyre mainly 12 month tracks and have more prereq requirements than what ive taken for my bachelors."

Considering the situation, I would like to know opinions on SBS career management (top priority), networking opportunities, and how it works with their students to get good job placement in companies across the USA, specifically for MSMA students in consulting or tech.

Im applying to become a freshmen next fall in rochester and wanted to know your opinion.

There’s an supplemental essay prompt which basically asks you how do you plan to use your education at rochester to the improvement of the world. They allow you to write your typical essay or use art works or use a research that can help you answer the question.

Two years ago, I did an *obligatory* research on my previous high school. Everyone is meant to do a research/thesis to graduate, however, i came up with the topic, etc. The only thing I would note about mine is that I won a price in the state for the best methodology.

The title was something like “Math Logic Test to determine if the 5th graders from (schools name) can you Math Logic in their daily life”

my intention with the research was to see if kids were assimilating the contents they were studying to a point where they can apply them. i came up with this bc i saw my peers, 10th graders, struggling a lot with that. 

For this i used a lot of my knowledge in math olympiads to create the test and so on. the 5th grade teacher even told me he might keep using the test to diagnose future generations and so on 

my thing is, would you recommend i use this to answer the prompt instead of using the essay option?

However, it's been a week, and I still haven't received anything regarding financial aid.

To add to my concern, a few of my friends who were also accepted in the same ED round have already received their financial aid letters. I'm wondering if it's common for there to be such delays, or if this might be an indication of an issue with my application or mail delivery.

Should I reach out to the U of R Financial Aid Office via email to inquire about this? I don't want to come off as impatient or pushy, but I'm anxious about planning my finances for college. Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated!"

On the 11th of December public safety apprehended two students, arresting and charging one; for being present during a peaceful sit-in in the Hirst Lounge (a large common space). The university promptly released a statement to students and parents stating “During the course of the event, a University student struck a DPS officer on the side of the head and was arrested and charges are pending.” This couldn’t be farther from the truth. 

A widely circulated video shows a female student being man handled and eventually overwhelmed by 6 public safety officers after refusing to but then complying with their requests. (Video link: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0u1qveuRHd/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) 

This university has been incredibly racist, xenophobic, and Islamophobic and they’re trying to cover their behinds.

An open letter written by faculty against the defamation and treatment of students has been circulating and has gained over 1000 signatures in one day.

I read the PDF (from 2015) which was very convincing, and mentioned 15-30 minute retakeble quizzes, involved teachers, etc. However, looking at the instructor's [RMP page](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/2761467) (all of which are from PHYS 121P), the universally poor reviews mention 4 additional midterms, big workload and an absent professor.

The reviewers also all mention getting off pace, and to be honest, I'm fine with learning from textbooks and TAs. The main thing was 13 quizzes, 4 midterms, a final, and plenty of homework sounds like more hassle than just doing the actual class, so is account this accurate or are people exaggerating after falling behind? If you've taken self-paced physics here, what are your thoughts?

For reference I took a year-long simple algebra based physics 101 course and later took ""Advanced Mechanics"" (we didn't strictly have APs) which was a calculus based physics class, but was more lab and HW focused so I did well considering the minimal emphasis on testing; generally though more rigorous physics won't be a foreign concept."

Two bonded rescue kittens available for adoption!!!!,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1727vln,8,0,2023-10-07 14:37:24,"All of their siblings have either been applied for or adopted, these guys are the only two left. I'm so sad (but also kind of happy) about it because they're the ones I would keep if I could. 

Follow their antics (and more!) at @coliesfosterkittens

Some facts about them

- They were born the end of May of this year

- Their names are Chai and Ms. Earl Gray 

- They were both bottle babies so they are extra affectionate.

- Chai is the tiniest of her litter. She started as the biggest but thanks to an allergy to KMR, she had some growth issues. She's totally healthy and grows like a weed now ☺️

- Ms. Gray is a little love bug. She spends her days chasing Chai around or nuzzling my face. Chai is totally rambunctious but absolutely LOVES people. 

- They are both absolute purr machines ❤️

- They are both FIV +... BUT they can (and currently do) love with negative cats without spreading it. 

DM me for adoption info. 

This is through a reputable rescue. Their adoption fee is reduced to 120 and covers spay and full vaccination"

Failed a couple classes, not doing well, took a year off. Come back, ace fall '19, then covid hits and all my personal progress is undone, I end up failing some classes again and take two years off to work as a substitute teacher. Fell in love with it and want to be a bio teacher. School district I worked at in fact is begging me to come back as a bio teacher, I have letters of rec from the admins at the ready. Been back for a semester now, doing good. After this fall, I will have completed the requirements for a degree in biology, plus all my writing/cluster requirements. However, I will still be two semesters short of 128 credits to graduate. What I really want to do is apply for the NYC teaching fellows program, it will get me teaching certified and pay for most of my masters in education. I've been in contact with them and the credits and classes I have already taken are sufficient for me to be let in to the program, all I need is the official degree before I'm allowed in. Even if the master's program they put me in gets upset that I am missing any undergrad reqs, under the program I have 5 years to make them up (at a cheaper school too).

My financial aid is depleted; if I stay for two semesters of random elective classes to get to 128 credits, I'm going to be in the hole 70k, and will have delayed my entrance into the ""real world"" by yet another year. I want to petition the school to see if they will give me the degree without having to stay longer and take the extra classes. Sounds impossible, I know from a business standpoint alone there is no way they would want me to leave without paying the maximum amount of dough to them. Not sure legally how it works either, hence my asking here in case anyone is familiar. However, I feel that by telling my story to the deans there is a chance they will let me be a special case. I can talk about how covid affected my college career, personal growth, all that jazz. I just want to get on with my life. I have a surefire path to do so through the teaching fellows, all I need is a pat on the back from UR to move on. 

Am I delusional? Anyone think there is a chance? I appreciate any input."

ECE vs MechE,https://www.reddit.com/r/URochester/comments/15b9ryr/ece_vs_meche/,3,5,2023-07-27 18:41:40,"So I’m currently an incoming freshman who is set to major in electrical and computer engineering. I already met with my ECE advisor (Professor Kose) and he seems great, which makes me exited for his ECE 112 class. However, I’ve been having second thoughts about if I should stay as an electrical engineering major or switch to mechanical engineering.
I would say that I chose ECE in the first place bc I had a lot more experience with CS courses and robotics in high school than I did with chemistry or physics, however I’m not sure if I would want to do robotics in college opposed to joining Rochester’s Baja SAE club. Despite taking coding courses in high school, I don’t think I have as much experience coding as other CS majors in both Rochester and other universities have, and CSC 170 may be the only non-ECE coding course I plan on taking. I originally was interested in going into software engineering, but I feel as if the field is too overcrowded, so I’m now more interested in going into hardware or semiconductors.

Several questions I have about the departments:
The ECE curriculum looks pretty flexible for me the first two years, but I noticed that MechE requires more major-specific classes, so which program will let me pursue outside interests better?
From what I could tell, there seem to be fewer ECE students than MechE students, so how do the engineering classes compare in size? (I’ve always preferred smaller classes)
I am interested in pursuing research at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, so which field of engineers do they recruit from?
Lastly, how do the two compare in difficulty and in social life?

Appreciate any advice!"

Sorry if this isn't meant for this sub, but I'm a prospective student and I'm considering going to Rochester. I'm here for an admitted students event and I have a few questions.

1. What is the weather like usually? I heard it is often bitterly cold. Also, I heard the East Coast gets humid af during the summers. I'm from California, so I'm pretty concerned about this. I was kinda dying today and it was like 40 degrees, which is apparently pretty warm for Rochester I heard.
2. How challenging are academics? I want to double major in economics and computer science and do a minor in either Spanish or music. Is this doable? I would say I'm an average student. I've taken about 9 AP classes and gotten mostly A's and a couple B's in the classes. I want academics to be somewhat challenging for me, but I don't want it to be so tough that it's demotivating, which is something I've felt in high school.
3. What is the social scene like and what do you do in Rochester? It doesn't seem like there's much to do here and it seems kind of like a suburb. What do you on campus and in Rochester for fun? How feasible are day trips to NYC and Niagara?
4. Are students generally nice? I come from an overly-competitive and toxic public school, so I really don't want a repeat of that in college.

2. What opportunities does Rochester have for engineering and pre-med students (Internships, co-ops).
3. How collaborative is the pre-med community
4. Does the engineering program have any flaws?"

He recommended a school like Virginia Tech instead (who I have not yet heard back from).  I made a similar post in the Clarkson subreddit, and both replies indicated that the choice between Clarkson and U of R comes down to whether I want my math the be focused on engineering or medicine, which I have a hard time believing.  I’m curious to hear what arguments current U of R graduate students / professors may have (especially (but not exclusively) those in mathematics).  Thanks!"

I recently got accepted to the University of Rochester. I plan to focus my studies on Creative Writing and Journalism related areas. I like how prestigious URochester is, but I am wondering if I should attend since my cost of attendance comes to 29k a year (!!).

My questions are:

1. Is the prestige worth the extra cost? I also got accepted to the University of Iowa (known for its writing program), and to Drake University (whose COA is significantly lower for me).
2. How valuable would my degree from URochester be, considering that I will be specializing in humanities and communications? 
3. Since I will most probably live permanently in the city I move to for college, what is it like to live in Rochester? 
4. How prevalent is racism here? (I'm brown). Also, as a woman, would my reproductive rights be assured?
5. How much does tuition at URochester rise every year?
6. So far, I have a 1540 SAT score and a 3.5 GPA (didn't attend high school in the US). Considering that I keep up a satisfactory academic record, how likely am I to receive local scholarships in this area? (I could comfortably attend if my COA is around 19k, so I'd need \~$10,000 in scholarships and work annually.)"

It’s the last day of add-drop period so if I drop that class, I have to find another social science class for a replacement. I just wonder how long will it take to get instructor approval to add the course? And can I submit the add-drop form first, then submit the instructor approval?

I just cannot cope with my roommate's chainsawing loud snoring noise. Even if I try to sleep before him, if I ever somehow wake up in the middle of the night, it means I'm going to stay up for the rest of the night. Since we are both staying on campus for the winter break, that means I have to listen to his snores for 16 hours a day because he doesn't do anything during the break aside from sleeping. I think I will go mad if I have to live like this for another semester. I did try to talk to him, but he just doesn't care. I tried putting on fans as white noise and wearing headphones when sleeping, but his snores just seem to penetrate everything.  
I guess another route is to get a room transfer, but I don't think it will be easy this time of the year right? I did send a request, but I don't know how long that will take."

I am an international student. I have an undergrad (three-year degree) in cs with a major in data analytics. I have been working for close to a year full-time remotely as a data engineer. My work usually revolves around building ETL pipelines in dask and deploying them to our clusters. While I self-taught myself almost everything I do at work, I feel at times I lack a theoretical base. Most of the time, it's pure trial and error and skimming docs to learn something. 

\- As the next step in my career, I wanted to do an MS. I have a few questions that I am looking for an answer to from you all.

\- Looking at the program and courses, CS feels close to data engineering than the Data Science - program. Folks who have done CS, what do you think? 

\- What would be an average class size? I heard more people are enrolled in CS compared to the Data Science course. Is it true? 

\- What do you think about MS CS at Rochester in general? 

\- How are the job opportunities?

And if you want to double major, say, in Math, then do you have to get done with the Physics major by sophomore year and do math in junior and senior (or so), or do you take both simultaneously over 4 years? (Is that how it works in all colleges?) And clusters? They are required, right? So, that as well simultaneously or when you are done with majors (btw, are Clusters = Electives?), or do we have to follow the courses as stated in [this](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/pas/assets/pdf/undergraduate/4yearbspas.pdf) worksheet and cannot take others?

I'm coming from a SUNY CC, I just graduated this month with an honors AS in mathematics and an honors AS in social sciences. I've got a 4.0.

I applied to UofR's mathematics program, specifically I really like the honors BS track as I would like to go to grad school. UofR is taking all of my credits and the social science degree takes care of my outside major clusters - I'd only have to take math courses here and not worry about anything else.

I want to know about rigor. I've taken my calculus courses and linear algebra as honors courses, I like a challenge and I like to struggle a little. But I also really like to do well. I'm a little concerned that coming from a SUNY CC, UofR may be more than I can handle. Not only because of an increase in rigor but also because I'd be coming in with junior standing and right into analysis. 

If you're a math major at UofR, what is it like? If you're a SUNY transfer into any major, what was that transition like for you? Finally, if you're a SUNY transfer into the mathematics major I definitely want to know what your experience has been like.

I've been reaching out online and to friends to help me make my decision, because I honestly see some great pros for both and some cons for both as well. 

I'm coming from a community college in NY after getting my associates in Biological Sciences, and plan to keep the same major at UR. One thing that comes up frequently is people worrying I won't be able to stand the academic rigor at UR. There have been instances of people telling me I'll crash and burn, and suggesting I attend the public university because they say it won't be as difficult as UR.

It's kind of disheartening, I won't lie, and brings up many doubts, so I'm wondering if anyone has had experience coming from community college and can speak about this. I've heard about transfer shock, but some people make it seem like I'll never be able to handle work at UR because I attended community college.

I know some other people say that a college won't accept you unless they think you can handle the work, but also... what if UR just knew they were taking a risk on me, and decided to accept me because I had a really great interview and strong essays? I do currently have a 4.0 GPA, but I have trouble making it seem like much to myself because classes at community college are known to be easier."

URochester for Premed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/URochester/comments/uddkoc/urochester_for_premed/,8,9,2022-04-27 20:51:59,"



Hi everyone! I'm a high school senior who got into UofR recently as a Biology major and I had a couple of questions about the premed program here. I am deciding between this school and Ohio State University.

1. Would you recommend UofR for premed? Is it worth it? (Not factoring in the expenses) 

2. How would you describe the overall premed culture at this school? Is it welcoming and helpful or toxic and cutthroat? 

3. How easy is it to get clinical volunteering/research opportunities at the med school and at Strong?

4. Are there any programs that facilitate research on campus?

5. How useful is it to have an affiliated med school? Can I do research under the med school profs? 

6. How hard is the grading at UofR? Some people talk about grade deflation. Can someone speak to this? Also, how much does the open curriculum help in achieving a higher gpa through taking easy classes? 

7.I know that premed is a popular track at UofR Do most of the students that come in premed stick it out, or do they drop out for various reasons?

8. I’m also interested in potentially data science/statistics and business as well? How good are the departments for these two areas of study?

8. What is the quality of professors? Does it fluctuate wildly between classes? Is it consistently not great? consistently good? Any objectively unfair ones?

9.What classes do I need to watch out for or are cutthroat? Are there weed out classes? Is it manageable to have a good GPA along with other extracurriculars?

10.Where do premeds go for medical school, any top schools? 

11.How is the quality of the premed advising? Does the premed health committee give letters to all premeds who apply?

12.Are there any premed programs or  opportunities that you felt really helped you ?

Any and all types of input are appreciated :)"

Is it likely they'd be willing to meet me at 40k a year? Should I continue asking UR for more aid? Is UR even worth 60k of total loans for my undergrad (if they meet me at 40k)?

One of the things that I really don't have much idea of is the cost of living in Rochester. The estimate says Off Campus Room + Board is $10,000 a year. Does this sound more or less correct? I know it must vary widely depending on what room I find to live in and how I plan meals, but what has your experience been? More expensive, or less?
