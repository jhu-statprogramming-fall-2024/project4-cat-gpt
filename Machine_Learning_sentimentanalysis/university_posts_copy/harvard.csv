I was later told that it's obnoxious to ask someone who is wearing Harvard clothing if they went to Harvard, **too**.

It's so hard to make friends as an adult, but I thought that the conversation was fine and at least now I have a new acquaintance.

"Didn't write thesis, regret",https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1gqflyl/didnt_write_thesis_regret/,37,18,2024-11-13 15:35:55,"I'm a grad and I struggled with insane mental health issues the whole time I was in school, especially the second half. Covid early on did no favors.

I constantly have ideas for what I would have written a thesis on if I had been in a better headspace. One idea in particular, I came up with while I was still a junior, and probably still had time to decide to thesis. I really like this idea and feel it would have been a lot of fun to write, if I weren't so avoidant and afraid of failure or rejection.

The regret is eating at me. Is anyone in a similar boat? I feel like I missed out on a major part of the experience and I don't know if I could forgive myself :("

I am applying for the Masters in Science in Computational Science and Engineering program at Harvard and was hoping to get to know about how the program is, how someone who has experienced it has liked it. My primary interests are data science and web technologies. 

I have a bachelors in Computer Science and have worked for the past 2 years at a software start up. I did kinda want to work in industry right out of college but I am not that impressed by my progress in the past 2 years and I believe a Masters would help me improve my general software abilities, create connections and then maybe I could get a role at a better start up with more growth opportunities. 

I would like to know specifically about the courses that students take and how would you say that has helped you. I looked through the courses here(https://seas.harvard.edu/masters-computational-science-and-engineering/courses) and was wondering if this was the correct location like are these the primary courses which everyone who is doing a masters takes. 

What about job opportunities? I am doing a Masters in Science which is typically a 2 semester program but apparently some people do a semester internship and make it a 3 semester program. So I was wondering if that is common, how does that work, does the college help get the internship. Are there several job fairs, companies coming to the university, placement type programs?

Also I did my bachelors in US but I am not a US citizen so I dont think that should cause any issues but just providing that information as well. 

Would generally appreciate any information about the program

I'm a prospective student and was wondering what it's like as an undergraduate in the Astronomy program (I'm interested in exoplanets so feel free to provide any info specific to that concentration if you happen to have experience):

1. Are research/internship positions hard to acquire? How do you interact with professors in a research context? (e.g. mostly virtually, in a lab, in a coffee shop, etc.)

2. To what extent do you collaborate with other undergrads/grads in research?

3. To what extent do you collaborate with people from other institutions (MIT Kavli, SAO, etc.)?

4. Is it easy to pursue a double major? Which ones are most convenient, and which ones would be most useful?

5. What cool things does your department/research group do? (anything you enjoy or think is unique to Harvard)

I also have a few questions about the general Harvard experience for those who don't have experience in Astronomy:

6. Is the student orchestra hard to audition into? What other ensembles/opportunities are available? (I play the clarinet!)

7. What are your favorite spots to study/hang out, and why? (can be on or off campus)

Symptoms of OCD include obsessions (i.e., distressing and intrusive thoughts that keep coming back to you) and compulsions (i.e., repetitive behaviors that you feel compelled to do). I wanted to pass along an opportunity to participate in a research study that may be of interest to any of you who experience these symptoms and notice they are causing impairment to your life. The research study involves 1 virtual intake assessment lasting 2-3 hours and 2 in-person visits (lasting 3.5 and 2 hours, respectively) on back-to-back business days where you complete a fear learning computer task while we measure your brain waves (via electroencephalogram or EEG) and the sweatiness of your palms (via skin conductance) and administer a noninvasive form of brain stimulation (i.e., transcranial direct current stimulation or tDCS). You will be compensated $300 for your time upon completion of the study. If you are interested in learning more, please visit our website ([https://mghocd.org/ocdfearstudy/](https://mghocd.org/ocdfearstudy/)), and if you are interested in participating, please fill out this 5-min survey: \[[https://redcap.link/x8d149fp](https://redcap.link/x8d149fp)\].

If it looks like the study may be a good fit, we will be in touch with information about next steps! Any questions can be directed to [mghocdfearstudy@partners.org](mailto:mghocdfearstudy@partners.org) or (617) 643-0850. Thanks so much and feel free to share this post with friends/family."

I an currently interning at the MGH Navy Yard campus, doing a research support job.

I am applying for full-time roles. Some are at Harvard as a Bioinformatics workers there.

I commute from my parent's house. I take the Haverhill line express train to North Station, and then commute to my workplace from there. The MGH Navy Yard is barely 1.2 miles away from North, I can take the shuttle, or walk. No need to rely on the subway, especially the red line.

How bad is the commute from North Station to Harvard? I'm nervous because Harvard is a whole 5 miles away. I know the cross platform connection at North makes it easy to quickly hop on an orange of green line train to take me to a redline connection, but with how slow the red line is, is it reasonable? I know many Urban Jobs are a little lenient with punctuality , but I would still like to be able to arrive at work by 9.

I have been reading the Harvard Crimsons old coverage of Cambodia, where the crimson openly supports the Khmer Rouge. Now prior to the fall of Nol's Military dictatorship and Americas bombing campaign, supporting the Khmer Rouge is understandable. However, after the Khmer Rouge takes power and begins Yero Zero in 75, the Crimson while still supporting them out a kind of ""socialist solidarity "", the news of atrocities begins to cause some trepidation. (Cambodia and Crimson Politics - https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/9/1/cambodia-and-crimson-politics-pbobne-day/) 

However by 76, as what is probably the worst genocide since the Holocaust is in full swing, the crimson has not only continued its support for the Khmer Rouge but has moved to open genocide denial. (Red Scare Over Cambodia - https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1976/2/28/red-scare-over-cambodia-pbpbress-poison/). 

Thus my question is, has the Crimson ever retracted/apologized for their support for a regime that it is not hyperbolic to say is comparable to Nazis in their crimes against humanity, and is there anywhere I can read it. "

Sasha is the anomaly, the executive canine money maker for Harvard which features in a ton of uninspiring old selfiess each year.

At dog training schools, K9 student dogs are not an issue as they're either separated into their own classes and cohort, or they're few in number.

How can Harvard let Sasha be the canine face on campus when there are squirrels to be photographed everywhere? And whatever happened to the turkey suit mascot?

As I have been ranting, I feel the need to propose some solutions

1. Dramatically reduce the Sasha pictures and public appearances
2. Separate Sasha department. Let campus services have her and feed her HUDS leftovers.

This current Kennedy School Student Government election cycle is another demonstration of this stupidity. Anyone normal who hears the current MC/MPA candidate (cringe washed up auntie) speak would probably want to blow their brains out. How can HKS let MC/MPAs run for student body president when they're here for only a year and couldn't be more disconnected from the core student body. The HKS Whatsapp group is also inflamed right now because of dumb arguments raised by MC/MPAs on data privacy to smear other candidates. Complete shit show.

As I have been ranting, I feel the need to propose some solutions

1. Dramatically reduce the class size of MC/MPAs and increase admissions standards
2. Separate MC/MPA classes. Let them have their own classroom experience with fellow 40+ year olds
3. Have them maintain their own student government
4. Clearly label their degrees as ""Executive MPAs"" so they don't pretend to be regular 2-years"

"Freshman Interesting in CS, Stats, etc: take Math 25",https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1f1n5n3/freshman_interesting_in_cs_stats_etc_take_math_25/,4,3,2024-08-26 12:38:20,"If you're an incoming freshman interested in something like CS, Stats, or even Math, and you have a modest math background (e.g. 5 on Calc BC in high school), you should take Math 25. 

As a CS concentrator, I, to a degree, regret not taking a harder math class freshman year (I took Math 21B and the highest level of math I did in HS was AP Calc BC). 

Taking Math 22 is okay, but I think you will get the most reward in terms of developing your math abilities by taking Math 25. Although it will take more work, I think you can find time to devote to the class if you take a very reasonable schedule along with it (second-hardest course is CS50, and then you take expos/frosh seminar and/or EC10). 

The fact is that if you have a strong foundation in calculus, but lack proof experience, you can take Math 25, although you will have to make sure to dedicate a lot of your academic schedule to it. I argue that the dedication is worth it, especially for a field like CS in my experience. 

Although you'll end up developing proof skills by taking the CS20 + CS120/121 + CS124, the mathematical maturity you develop from just taking Math 25A is probably equivalent to what you would get by taking the core theoretical CS series combined. People who take Math 25/55 also tend to perform better in CS124 because they're able to more comfortable quickly apply concepts from lecture to problems on exams. 

So TLDR, if you're studying CS or an adjacent field, at least take Math 25A freshman fall. "

NOTE to Incoming Freshman: DON'T study Computer Science,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1erlwhh/note_to_incoming_freshman_dont_study_computer/,553,175,2024-08-13 23:09:54,"I'm a rising senior studying CS and Statistics, and I, to a degree, regret studying computer science. Now, contrary to the title of this post, I am not saying that no one should study computer science. Rather, the title is hyperbolizing but emphasizing the fact that you should approach the prospect of studying computer science with some hesitation, especially at Harvard. Studying computer science is not that much of a straightforward choice anymore. However, despite the exaggerated title, I honestly suggest that no one studies *only* computer science, without pairing it with a joint or double concentration in an adjacent field (e.g statistics, mathematics, physics and applied math). This is simply my opinion, which I think is an unpopular one, but I am just giving my perspective.

Reasons for not studying computer science:

1. *Oversaturated Job Market*: The job market is oversaturated, as there have been an influx of computer science degrees over recent years. It used to be that studying computer science at many universities would guarantee a solid job and studying computer science at Harvard would almost guarantee some kind of well-paying, entry-level big tech job. This is not the case anymore, just getting a computer science degree at Harvard isn't enough anymore. On top of taking and studying CS classes, companies are expected students to do personal projects/research or past internships, regardless of what school you go to, for internships and entry-level positions. In addition to that, passing interviews requires a rigorous study and practice of Leetcode-type problems.

The point is that studying computer science is losing relevance in terms of getting a tech job because employers are recognizing more the fact that computer science is not the same as software engineering. In my opinion, employers aren't necessarily prioritizing computer science students that much anymore for SWE/tech jobs over other STEM students (math, physics, and engineering) students. What you learn in most of your CS courses, which tend to be more theoretical, don't matter that much for doing the job. You literally need a basic understanding of coding (i.e. syntax, loops, functions, conditionals) and then some foundational understanding of data structures and algorithms (which you can get from leetcode). Leetcode-style problems aren't even typically relevant when you get to the job, but having a notion of efficiency is important. Even algorithms classes like CS120 and CS124 don't help immensely with leetcode. CS124 can help make **starting** leetcode easier, but you won't be able to solve leetcode problems well just after taking that class. You still need to practice.

Even if computer science classes like CS124 were tremendously helpful, the point is that many students take these kinds of classes, not just computer science students. CS124 is a very popular course among math, physics, and applied majors as well. In fact, the students who usually perform the best in these classes are people with more mature mathematical backgrounds. Employers don't really care if you've taken a breath of computer science courses; they're just looking for basic competencies in programming and interview material. A math major who's has a background in algorithms is essentially equivalent to a CS major who's taken an algo course + a bunch of other CS courses when it comes to competing for tech jobs, especially if both have the adequate amount of outside-the-classroom experiences. Heck, sometimes studying STEM doesn't even matter. There's a decent number of humanities concentrators who end up working as software engineers after graduation.

2. *Intellectual Return and Pedagogy.* I would argue that studying computer science over other STEM fields doesn't provide much of an intellectual and even knowledge benefit. As I mentioned, a lot of the concepts you learn in computer science courses aren't directly relevant to jobs in the industry. The fact is, you are probably going to forget most of the stuff you learned in your computer science classes a few months after you graduate. Heck, it's likely you can barely remember material from courses a month after the semester ends. The most important concepts you learn from college is how to *problem-solve* and how to *learn*.

While I would say that studying computer science does improve problem-solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning skills, other STEM fields seem to be more effective at doing this for pedagogical and natural reasons. Specifically at Harvard, and also at other universities, computer science courses are generally not as well taught as other types of STEM classes. This pedagogical gap happens because material tends to be glossed over in computer science classes, while math and statistics classes focus more on subtleties and foundational concepts. This also seems to be because the computer science department is very research-oriented while other departments, especially statistics, tend to focus more on teaching. Most computer science professors treat teaching as presenting basic concepts needed to understand their research while other professors pay more careful attention to how they introduce a concept to their students.

An important idea is that computer science is literally a **branch of mathematics.** Therefore, many computer science concepts rely on using math skills. If you have a solid math background, which you can develop by studying subjects like math, physics, and engineering, transitioning to computer science is not really that difficult. Someone who studied computer science for years may start out with more knowledge than you, but they might not necessarily be better at solving computer science problems. Domain-specific knowledge isn't critical for solving many problems in computer science, because the knowledge can be picked up relatively quickly if you're comfortable with mathematics. This does not mean that people who study computer science don't also have the skills to comfortably transition to math and engineering, but it is easier to go from math/engineering/physics to computer science than vice versa. Even if you're interested in going into academia for CS, I don't think you get that much advantage from studying it over students studying adjacent-fields.

TLDR: Don't only study computer science. At the minimum, pair it with something else. Opinions are my own, and you're happy to disagree."

This was such a tradition that the Crimson wrote a piece on the phasing out of butter pats in 1995. I am wondering: Do first-years who eat in Annenberg have any similar traditions? Or is dining-hall misbehavior a thing of the past?"

How do I forgive myself for not doing better?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1epuith/how_do_i_forgive_myself_for_not_doing_better/,71,14,2024-08-11 20:25:05,"Harvard didn‚Äôt go how I expected. From the very start, I recall feeling unmotivated and struggling with even the easy stuff. I tried constantly, but never succeeded, in figuring out what is going on mental health wise. I really tried.

Without getting too specific, I regret how I spent my time at Harvard. I got into a particular club and thought it was a golden ticket to a particular path. It was a very Quixote-like because it was‚Ä¶not what I expected, and actually so, so much worse. It chewed me up and spit me out. I kept spending my time there thinking things would get better, but it was sunk cost fallacy thinking. I wish every day I put time into other activities.

I am consumed by regret and self-blame. I wake up in a panic over it. When I think of the ‚Äúgood times,‚Äù or the covid era when things were relatively calm and easy, before I joined the club, I feel legitimate fear. Does anyone have fear around nostalgia? I‚Äôll remember something somewhat pleasant and feel absolute dread.  Like, why couldn‚Äôt I lock in at that moment? Why didn‚Äôt I do differently? Why didn‚Äôt I keep talking to that person I used to talk to? The gist of the thoughts is generally, ‚ÄúI was so safe then.‚Äù Maybe it‚Äôs because the rut I‚Äôm in has been causing some serious tension at home. It feels really scary.

Are there any alumni hanging around here who had a rough time at Harvard, and even the first few years out of school, but got back on their feet? I could really use some hope right now. My thoughts have been getting pretty dark."

Garber to serve as president until new search '26-'27.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1eifoa2/garber_to_serve_as_president_until_new_search_2627/,70,25,2024-08-02 17:16:49,"""Following a meeting of the governing boards earlier today, my colleagues and I are very pleased to let you know that Alan Garber, our interim president since January, will serve as president of the University through the end of the 2026-27 academic year. We plan to launch a full-scale search for his eventual successor in the late spring or summer of 2026.

After serving with distinction as Harvard‚Äôs provost for more than twelve years, Alan has done an outstanding job leading Harvard through extraordinary challenges since taking on his interim presidential duties seven months ago. We have asked him to hold the title of president, not just interim president, both to recognize his distinguished service to the University and to underscore our belief that this is a time not merely for steady stewardship but for active, engaged leadership.

Over the last seven months, and for years before that, Alan has led with a deep concern for all members of the Harvard community, a strong devotion to enduring university ideals, and a paramount commitment to academic excellence. At an especially demanding moment for higher education, Harvard is very fortunate to benefit from his intellectual acumen and breadth of interests, his integrity and fair-mindedness, his equanimity and empathy, his decades-long devotion to the University, his extensive knowledge of its people and parts, and his ardent belief in the power of higher education and research‚Äîand their potential to improve the lives of people and communities near and far. His time in Mass Hall has demonstrated his clear-eyed determination both to help the University chart a course through troubled waters and to affirm the primacy of the teaching, learning, and research at Harvard‚Äôs heart.

In conversations with many people across our community and beyond during the past weeks and months‚Äîincluding especially helpful recent consultations with each of the deans as well as an array of faculty and alumni leaders from the various schools‚Äîwe have consistently heard praise for Alan‚Äôs qualities and how his leadership meets the current moment. People have highlighted his thoughtful and balanced judgment, his openness to different points of view, his even temperament in turbulent times, his concern for student well-being, his commitment to academic freedom and constructive dialogue, his recognition of diversity and inclusion as integral elements of academic excellence, his appetite for innovation, and his constant focus on the best interests of Harvard as a whole. Our recent consultations have strongly underscored the high regard in which Alan is held by a broad range of people who have watched him work and come to appreciate his strengths.

Alan is not only an admired academic leader but also a scholar and educator of exceptional reach. After graduating from Harvard College¬†*summa cum laude,*¬†he earned a PhD in Economics from Harvard and an MD with research honors from Stanford University. A member of the Stanford faculty for 25 years, he became a professor of medicine, economics, and health policy, and was founding director of Stanford‚Äôs Center for Health Policy and its Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research, while also practicing as a physician in Palo Alto. Since returning to Harvard in 2011 to serve as provost, he has held faculty appointments in Harvard Medical School, the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, and the Economics Department in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. As the longest-serving provost in Harvard‚Äôs history, responsible for overseeing academic activities throughout the institution and working to foster new connections across the schools, he gained singular insight into the full span of opportunities and challenges facing the University.

As noted, Alan will carry forward as president through the 2026-27 academic year and we will launch a full and wide-ranging search for his successor in the late spring or summer of 2026. We believe this plan will give Alan and his leadership team the opportunity to sustain and build momentum on a range of priorities and initiatives. It will also provide an ample interval for those of us on the Corporation to reflect, in consultation with others, on how best to approach the future presidential search, including how to ensure robust input from across Harvard and beyond.

As we all know, these remain challenging times. We have experienced significant divisions and pointed questions. We have hard work still ahead to reaffirm our core academic values and our collective focus on learning and scholarship. We must continue working to restore bonds of trust, to bridge divides, to combat forms of invidious hate and bias, and to foster a secure campus climate conducive to dialogue across differences. No less, we have more work ahead to amplify higher education‚Äôs contributions to the wider world and to shine light on why they matter.

Alan‚Äôs talents and experience position him well to guide us in this vital work. Along with my colleagues on the governing boards, I hope you will offer him your concerted support, and I thank all of you‚Äîfaculty, students, staff, alumni, and friends‚Äîfor all you do for Harvard.

Sincerely,  
Penny Pritzker

"IAmA 2 year old (turned 2 a month ago, DOB: July 10th 2022) and I have an IQ off the charts (approximately anywhere between 600-1,000 estimated by my doctor, though using my methods I tested myself at 884) Ask me anything!
",https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1eguyym/iama_2_year_old_turned_2_a_month_ago_dob_july/,0,9,2024-07-31 18:46:05,"Alright, before I start I'm gonna just start by saying, due to personal reasons, I am not yet ready to come out to the world, though various news sources have come to speak to my family and me. While I have an iq about 8.84x that of the average person, however I've found ways to relate to kids alike as well as adults. No one outside me or my extended family knows about me.

I'm also gonna talk about some misconceptions:

While we, high IQ geniuses, do often have mental health problems, that is only up to a limit. While there has been absolutely NO ONE who I know of in the world who has had an iq above 300-400, leading to misconceptions, once your IQ goes above 420-450, you will find ways to relate, and act like normal people, which I am able to do in front of other children my age when I'm out. I throw tantrums, I go in a stroller, mess up my talking to match my peers, though I'm lightyears ahead, and am learning euclidean geometry and boolean algebra, and finished my calculus course with straight A's through self learning, and I've learned much through discovery. Plus, I remember every single thing, as my episodic memory was developed when I was just a couple of weeks old, unlike the average 3-5 years of age.

Now about me:

Anyways, a little bit about myself. My name is DD (only giving initials as I don't wanna share too much information about myself), I am half Indian (dad's side), and half Lebanese American (moms side), and I live in Franklin, a suburb of Boston. I was born on July 10th 2022, to a 26 year old mom, and a 27 year old dad (their ages at my birth), who both work in sales, and hold bachelors degrees in economics from Tufts university. My height is 2'8 (81cm), and I weigh 22lbs (10kgs), a tiny bit short and skinny for my age, though still just on the lower end of average. I took my SAT this may, and I scored a perfect 1600, 800 on both sections. I've also been starting to work on solving the toughest maths and science problems in the world, which, I haven't found solutions yet, but I know I will within a span of a few months.

I have been accepted into a Harvard online accelerated course, majoring in geology and maths, minoring in neuroscience, psychology, chemistry, physics. Yeah, I know it is a lot of work, however, I've mastered the technique of skim reading at 16 months, and am able to read 10,000 words per minute easily, and remember every bit of what I read, and am able to learn and apply it on the spot. Based on my predictions, which so far have a 99.8% success rate, I will finish my bachelors, masters and phd in a little under a year, and be a 3 year old professor, and that's when I'll come out to the world.

My milestones:

I was able to talk since I was about 6 weeks old (my first word was ""hi""), where I also started to sit and crawl unassisted one day. Yeah IK y'all may say this is impossible, that muscles ain't gonna develop so quick regardless of your iq, however I will say that is true to an extent, however, once IQ goes higher than say 320, muscles also develop way faster. Anyways, just by observing, at the age of 3 months, I also started being able to speak in sentences, and through observation, I learned the alphabets, which I perfected the day I saw an alphabet chart of my 3 year old cousin, and started to learn numbers. At the same time, using the power of my will and resilience, I started to walk, which took around a month for me to perfect. By the time I was 4 months, I was able to walk perfectly without support, and my speech was about that of your average 3 year old. By the time I was 5 months old, I was reading simple words, and I was learning simple addition and subtraction, and my speech was eloquent and clear, with the vocabulary of a kindergartener. By the time I was 8 months old, I was able to read some simple chapter books, at 1st-2nd grade level. By the time I was 10 months old, I had learned and perfected multiplication times tables and division, started to learn simple fractions, and was reading at a 3rd grade level. By the time I approached my first birthday, I was reading at a 4-5th grade level, was learning long division, and multiplication, and simple algebra, and had started swimming lessons in our home pool, which I was quickly confident at, and perfected the basics within weeks. By the time I was 18 months old, my reading level was at that of a 10th grader, and was learning from AP high school maths textbooks, and had mastered pre calculus. When I was 22 months old, and already teaching myself college level maths, with the reading level of a college student. At this time, while I always knew traditional education wasn't for me, I knew it would be best if I had a proper, verified college degree, so, I took the SAT in may 2024, scoring a perfect 1600. So now, I will be starting my degree at Harvard university as of September 2024

Ever since I was a mere two months old, I knew I was special, and to avoid attracting attention, just through mere observation, I acted like typical kids my own age, and my parents didn't want me to have attention as an infant, so they put me in a newborn's pram, with a blanket over, so other people couldn't see me sit, and do things well above my age, which I understood by a mere 2 months, by observation, as my aunt also had a baby 1 week after I was born, who lived in my area, who often visited, who I observed intently.

Thanks for reading, wishing you the best of luck and a good path forward in life. This is my journey of coming out, though I won't expose myself to the world until I earn my phd next year (as per my predictions, which like I said, have a 99.8% success rate.

I'm on the pre-med and neuro track so here's the review for all the classes I took. 

Freshman Year: 

LS1A: The PIES were horrendous. Hated them. Dan talks very VERY slowly so be prepared for that. And he rambles a lot. The PSETs were okay and the content is manageable if you stay on top of everything. Overall, 5/10. The labs were fine, and the grading was okay. Nothing spectacular. This course is more chem focused than bio so be ready for that. I didn't hate this class but it was super time-consuming. The only way to survive is to either be super on top of your stuff and learning or OFFICE HOURS. I can't push this enough. OH will save your life. 

PSY 1: DO NOT TAKE THIS WITH JASON MITCHELL!!!!! I cannot stress this enough. Worst experience of my life at Harvard. the exams are super hard. The material is basic intro psych but interesting. I didn't like this class ONLY because of the prof. Although I hear this class generally sucks regardless lol. Sadly, this is a course req for neuro and psych but you can take it pass fail for neuro. IF U CAN PLEASE TAKE THIS PASS FAIL. Not worth it. 3/10

Math 1A: The teaching staff were great but the pace was weird. If you didn't take Calc 1 take Math Ma instead. Super fast-paced and all over the place with teaching. The grading was good and overall not terrible. But if I did it all over again, I would have taken Math Ma so 6/10

Expos 10: Expos was great. 8/10

LS1B: The QGuides LIED TO ME. They all said ""LS1B is easier than LS1A"" LIES. LS1B was VOLUMES harder than 1a. The PIES were DIABOLICAL. Andrew Berry was trying to trip students up every chance he got and it shows. Please don't listen to the masses and please PREPARE for this course. I hated it sm omg war flashbacks. The teaching staff is great. Lab was great. The final exam was okay too. It's literally just the PIES and Midterms that sucked. At one point, it felt like I had an exam for this class every week. It was terrible. Super time-consuming. GO TO OFFICE HOURS PLEASE!!!! The content was great though!  5/10.

GENED on Psychotherapy: PLEASE TAKE THIS. SUPER EASY A. I LITERALLY DIDN'T EVEN GO TO CLASS AND GOT AN A. 100000/10 

Expos 20: You know what they say. You NEED David Nee. Love Expos 20 with David Nee. Super fair grader and overall a great vibe! 100/10

PS11: Oh please for the love of God this class was so BORING. Jim talked SO SLOW! Also literally ate up my whole week. GO TO OH!!! But the prof changed from when I took it so good luck yall cuz when I took it, grading was easy. Can't even complain. 7/10

  
Sophomore Year: 

Chem 17: I personally loved Orgo. Hot take ik. But chem 17 was honestly a vibe and the Teaching staff HAVE MY HEART. SIRINYA I LOVE YOU! GO TO OFFICE HOURS PLEASE !!! Grading was great too! 10/10

Neuro 80: Overall, should be an easy A if you stay on top of your work! 9/10 

GENED Music from Earth: Easy A. Please Take! 10/10

Arabic AA: TAKE THIS WITH USTAZA DANA. LOVE HERRRR 100/10. The language program here is amazing btw! 

  
Chem 27: Honestly, I love this one too but I liked chem 17 better. This one is less mechanism based early on and more bio based. Brian's exams are much harder but overall, not bad! 10/10 

Arabic AB: Had this with Ustaz richard. He's super nice and a fair grader. Cold Calls tho T\_T 9/10 

PSY1900: Literally easiest stats class ever please. Exams take FOREVER TO FINISH THO! 10/10 

Ling 83: I HATE HOW THEY GRADE HW. I didn't like their HW grading at all omg. Class was fair tho! Exams were easy. Prof Davidson is super passionate! 8/10

I haven't taken the physics series yet but will this semester. Will update this next year lol! Hope this helps!

Outside of the students obsessed with them‚Äî many get by not even caring or buying into that system.

In the past, it seems like these exclusive clubs were clear predictors of unicorn career outcomes. 5 of the 8 Harvard US presidents were in Hasty Pudding Club, and all of them were already rich, elite and connected when they were admitted to Harvard (two Adams, two Roosevelts, and JFK). 

Yet now, it seems to be much more common for people from middle class, lower class, and non-white backgrounds to achieve positions of power like President. Biden didn‚Äôt even go to an Ivy League. Clinton came from poverty. Even more recent Harvard leaders like Ketanji Brown Jackson or Obama have no records of being in Ivy League secret or exclusive organizations (and their skin colors would‚Äôve likely prevented them anyways). 

And despite nepotism and elitism being very obvious in industries like Hollywood and politics, I think it‚Äôs apparent that people at least value an illusion of meritocracy more than plain old elite gets the power. The internet has democratized many industries even more and shows like SNL actively look for non-Harvard non-lampoon members (their cast has very few Harvard students now). And there‚Äôs even a clear distaste for elitism in the public evident with the rise of populist leaders on the left and right and things like the word ‚Äúnepo baby‚Äù being used to discredit people.

In a 248-page document filed with authorities last year, Donovan made these and many other allegations, including that Harvard took the copyright to her book, blocked her from fulfilling obligations to donors, and stole her plans to publish confidential Facebook documents.  
  
But a Chronicle investigation ‚Äî¬†based on interviews and never-before-reported documents, recordings, and correspondence ‚Äî has found that several of these allegations are misleading, untrue, or contradicted by people directly involved. We spoke with nearly a dozen former colleagues who say they saw no evidence of corporate meddling, some of whom also say they no longer trust the scholar they once admired.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I‚Äôm new to Harvard

Hello! 

I‚Äôm taking the plunge and have accepted admittance to grad school this fall. Besides all the worry of financial stuff, I‚Äôm pretty excited for this awesome opportunity! 

Questions:
1. I‚Äôm from the southwest with mild winters, how are winters in MA? 

Well, my area in the southwest received a lot more snow than Cambridge! Haha I was actually excited to experience a huge snowfall out here but nothing! I went home for most of December and January so I‚Äôm not sure if I missed the coldest days, but I managed. Bought a thick jacket, gloves and headwear so the cold was manageable. I did, however, feel like I was getting more and more weary of the cold, wet, windy, and cloudy days as winter wore on. I think I may have gotten a little depressed, because at times I didn‚Äôt want to do anything other than stay at my apartment and sleep. Missed the sun and dry air! 

2. I‚Äôm thinking of driving, epic road trip! I want to have a car there so I can explore New England. Pros/cons? Like will I need to register with MA? 

So, I didn‚Äôt bring my car in July, but I did drive back in January! So, it was ok to not have a car, I got a term Charlie pass and they helped a lot going around mostly between Harvard and MIT. If I wanted to go further, like Walmart (can‚Äôt help it) I used the zip cars located outside my building or nearby. 

After a while, I felt very constricted to where I wanted to go ‚Äî first by how long it took to get to places using the public transportation, secondly by how zip cars were not always available and it was getting expensive (and time restrictions on the cars). 

Bringing my car helped me feel like I had the freedom to go places. Parking ‚Äî my building has a garage ‚Äî so my car was nearby in a protected space (from weather too) but it was 2k for the semester. I got towed twice in Cambridge and got like 2 tickets. I got an ez-pass for tolls. I didn‚Äôt have to get MA plates either. 

Freedom! I went to New Hampshire (scary), providence, and lots of other places. I generally love to drive‚Ä¶ back home we drive a lot. But winter months it‚Äôs pretty bleak around here haha

Traffic‚Äî first month was intimidating but after that, just being a courteous and respectful driver helps. Traffic isn‚Äôt all that bad, I‚Äôve driven in LA, Japan and been in crazy traffic in Delhi!

3. School culture - what can I expect? I‚Äôm really laid back, and love to meet people‚Äî are people friendly? 

Best part of my school was my classmates and my professors. Everyone was so welcoming and supportive. So this ended being an awesome place for me. 

4. On campus or off campus housing? Was looking at the HU site for apartments, they are expensive. I also don‚Äôt want roommates or to stay in a dorm - I‚Äôm an older student who has had my share of that! 

I did not have a place to stay literally until about two weeks before I came out here. My window for the HUH lottery was the end of May and so nothing was available! There was an early window open in April, but I believe you had to sign a lease that started almost immediately and pay upfront. 

I‚Äôm lucky in certain ways, not the hitting the lotto lucky but luck with conditions‚Äî about two weeks before coming out, I checked the HUH website and there were two units available. One quickly disappeared and so I just selected the one that was left. 

It was a furnished studio and I‚Äôm so happy that it worked out for me. It‚Äôs quiet and next to the river. 

5. Elitism ‚Äî how will I fit in as a middle/low income teacher? Are there Walmarts around? Lol

This was barely noticeable. My cohort were down to earth but some came from wealth. Didn‚Äôt matter at all. And I found my people at Walmart haha.

6. Best places to visit around Boston or to eat. My fam will probably come at some point would like to recommendations to get true east coast experience. 

Best experiences were the feast days at north end. Lots of places to eat around here as well. My family didn‚Äôt come out however. Haven‚Äôt had lobster roll yet :( or seafood for that matter. 

7. Down time‚Äî how much down time should I expect as a grad student? 

For my program August term was jam packed, but manageable. Fall term I took 19 credit hours. It was also manageable for me (it‚Äôs dependent on the courses you take) - had classes m-th so weekend was time to relax. 

Spring term I took just 12. And only had classes on Tuesday and Wednesday. Lots of downtime! Again course dependent- I had a lot of projects I was working on though. 

8. Any other tips or advice! Thanks!

One thing weird is I got a grad meal plan thinking I would be able to use it starting August term‚Äî but it didn‚Äôt start till September. I had some food insecurity the first weeks of August. The receptions and such helped. My school finally is starting a food pantry for students - and I donated food because I went through that experience. 

I think my advice to my past self would be to not worry so much about fitting in, enjoy the short time at Harvard, make good connections and be yourself! "

The author, who was a writer for the Crimson, maturely entitled their piece: ""From a Suspended Senior: With a Raised Middle Finger and Love in My Heart"" claimed the following:

>I grew up trans in rural Maine, **working in kitchens and painting houses**. I‚Äôve come face to face with the law, **moved away from home** at 16. Where I‚Äôm from, going to college is not a given and leaving the state is uncommon.

>But in the spring of 2020, **living out of a garage loft without running water**, I became one of the first openly trans valedictorians in the country and the first person from my high school to get into Harvard.

What they left out is the widespread news coverage that appears to make clear that this is a warped version of the truth.  For example:

[https://wgme.com/news/local/belfast-senior-will-graduate-as-maines-first-transgender-valedictorian](https://wgme.com/news/local/belfast-senior-will-graduate-as-maines-first-transgender-valedictorian)

>The very first decision he made was to move out of his family‚Äôs house **and into their garage**, where he could live more independently. Since then, he has worked a number of minimum-wage jobs to support himself, buying his own food, clothes and other necessities. **His parents didn‚Äôt ask him to move out** **or pay his own way**, but it was something that the teen needed to do for himself.  
. . . 

>The teen‚Äôs fierce independence is part of his personality, according to his dad, **Belfast Mayor** Eric Sanders.

Having this context helps the Crimson's readers (and reddit users) obtain a greater understanding of the mentality and veracity of the suspended students that are claiming that they are victims of ""Harvard's injustice""."

So let's be generous and say 1300 students.  In other words, **less than 15%** of 9,262 students walked out in support of the students who apparently believe they should be exempt from the Harvard's time, place, and manner restrictions.

Fortunately, I snagged a 2BD in Peabody Terrace during the housing lottery. Still, I wanted to ask around and see if any law students (or anyone) lived there and could give some perspective about the semi-long walk (.8 miles can add up in the Boston cold) and live in the apartment in general. I'm slightly concerned about all the construction that they brought up in the rider and the idea of having to deal with noise is something on my mind.   
  
I have been browsing some private market options as well but the thought of paying 4 months worth of rent though deposits and fees as well as getting a co-signer is just exorbitantly expensive. Thank you in advance!"

It is disappointing to see the continued journalistic bias from the Crimson.  For example:

>""While the disciplinary actions have¬†[outraged many faculty](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/5/8/harvard-faculty-urge-garber-encampment-negotiations/)....""

Something like 10% of the faculty signed the letter the reports reference and it is a stretch to say that all of the signatories were ""outraged"". 

This could just as easily have been written ""while only a small fraction of the faculty have opposed disciplinary actions..."" especially since a dueling letter was issued by other faculty members.

>""Despite widespread backlash, at least 64 other colleges and universities across the country have asked local authorities to arrest or detain student protesters.""

As a percentage of the student bodies, the protestors and their supports are generally in the single digits.

I've been tangentially following encampment protests demanding that the university ""divest Harvard‚Äôs investments in genocide."" This raises a question about the real impact of such divestment actions. When an institution like Harvard sells its shares in Israeli companies, it's essentially just transferring ownership of those shares to another buyer. How does this movement of shares actually influence the economic or political landscape in a meaningful way? Can divestment from a university truly pressure a country or contribute to stopping a conflict, considering that the economic impact seems limited to changing ownership rather than affecting the broader economy?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on whether and how divestment can make a real difference in situations like this."

I'm looking into getting a 2B HUH apartment, and I've narrowed my options to a few.

With these options, I'm trying to decide what to prioritize:

i) **more space** (but much older and stand-alone buildings), OR

ii) **location & community benefits** (relatively new with more tenants in the whole building, like Peabody Terrace, One Western, Soldiers Park, etc.)

I was leaning to the roomy ones, but read somewhere that these old buildings may have rats and roaches crawling around. On the other hand, I read someone say Peabody has thieves stealing parcels (like Amazon).

That said, here goes the highlight questions:

1. **Do** ***old*** **housings (built in 1900-ish) really have meaningfully more rats/roaches than newer and crowded housings (e.g. Peabody Terrace, One Western, etc.)?**
2. **Is parcel theft a real threat?**

""Dear Members of the Harvard Community,

Over the last 12 days, the encampment in Harvard Yard has disrupted our educational activities and operations. The right to free speech, including protest and dissent, is vital to the work of the research university. But it is not unlimited. It must be exercised in a time, place, and manner that respects the right of our community members to do their work, pursue their education, and enjoy the opportunities that a residential campus has to offer. The encampment favors the voices of a few over the rights of many who have experienced disruption in how they learn and work at a critical time of the semester. I call on those participating in the encampment to end the occupation of Harvard Yard.

The disruptions from this encampment at the heart of the University have been numerous. Harvard College exams and other important activities and events have had to move elsewhere. Safety concerns over the past two weeks, including those raised as a result of students sleeping outdoors overnight, have required us to sharply limit access to Harvard Yard. Although some community members have said they are undisturbed by these conditions, we continue to hear reports of students whose ability to sleep, study, and move freely about the campus has been disrupted by the actions of the protesters. We are especially troubled by increasing reports that some within, and some supporting, the encampment have intimidated and harassed other members of our community. When Harvard staff have requested to see IDs in order to enforce our policies, supporters of the encampment have at times yelled at them, tried to encircle them, and otherwise interfered with their work. We have also received reports that passers-by have been confronted, surveilled, and followed. Such actions are indefensible and unacceptable.

As first-year students move out and as we begin our extensive preparations for Commencement, this ongoing violation of our policies becomes more consequential. Thousands of family members, friends, and loved ones will soon join us to celebrate the achievements of graduate and undergraduate students who have earned the right to walk in Commencement. This celebration is the culmination of years of hard work and accomplishment. The members of the Class of 2024 deserve to enjoy this milestone uninterrupted and unimpeded. It would be especially painful if students who graduated from high school or college during the pandemic were denied a full graduation ceremony for a second time.

The individuals participating in the activities of the encampment have been informed repeatedly that violations of University and School policies will be subject to disciplinary consequences and that further violations and continued escalation will result in increasingly severe sanctions. Last week, faculties across the University began delivering disciplinary notices to students who continued to participate in unauthorized, disruptive activity in the Yard despite these notices.

I write today with this simple message: The continuation of the encampment presents a significant risk to the educational environment of the University. Those who participate in or perpetuate its continuation will be referred for involuntary leave from their Schools. Among other implications, students placed on involuntary leave may not be able to sit for exams, may not continue to reside in Harvard housing, and must cease to be present on campus until reinstated.

Enforcement of these policies, which are essential to our educational mission, is an obligation we owe to our students and the Harvard community more broadly. It is not, as some have suggested, a rejection of discussion and debate about the urgent issues that concern the University, the nation, and the world. As an academic institution, we do not shy away from hard and important questions. There are many ways for our community to engage constructively in reasoned discussion of complex issues, but initiating these difficult and crucial conversations does not require, or justify, interfering with the educational environment and Harvard‚Äôs academic mission. Our disagreements are most effectively addressed through candid, constructive dialogue, building not on disruption, but on facts and reason.

Sincerely,
Alan M. Garber """

I'm currently a grad student considering my living situation for the next school year. Recently, I was offered a place out in Belmont by an acquaintance for dirt-cheap rent ($500/month with parking!), which offer I am very keen on taking. 

But, of course, my hesitation is regarding the commuting aspect. Getting the all-inclusive T-pass isn't a bad idea, but it's just that the Transit here is highly inconvent and unreliable, making it frustrating to even go get groceries sometimes. My other considering is to bring my car all the way from Georgia. 

Given my circumstances, what are the cost-benefits of bringing a car versus not? Is the inconvenience even worth the cheap rent? What're the things to consider if I were to bring a car? 

Thanks much for your advice!"

As the title implies, I was fortunate enough to be accepted to both Harvard and Stanford for my undergrad. I expected to have clarity after going to both admitted student weekends, but I'm more torn now than I was before.

I hope to study electrical engineering with a prospective double major in government/politics. At the moment, I think that I'll be going into the semiconductors/chip manufacturing industry. I do plan on pursuing a startup, but I think that it's crucial to build up a solid knowledge base first.

I fell in love with Harvard's campus, student life, and the city of Cambridge after Visitas. However, I still have a few concerns, particularly about the EE department.

* The SEC complex was hyped up by almost every engineering student that I met, but the tour was *very* underwhelming (they basically just showed us the entrance floor and a makerspace). Do you guys have access to lithography/fab equipment? Would this be open to use for an undergrad?
* EE at Harvard is too theoretical (something that I heard from students)
* Harvard EE doesn't carry as much weight in the industry? (not sure if this is true or not)
* Startup resources aren't as accessible in comparison to Bay Area, especially for anything outside of biomedical ventures

What I like:

* Very small department (would mean closer relationships to peers/professors)
* Not as much competition in engineering means greater access to opportunities/resources/research
* Cross registration with MIT
* Very strong government/politics programs
* Awesome dorm culture, heard that the party scene is pretty nice as well
* Much closer to home than Stanford

I would love to hear back from Harvard students about their own experiences, and what I should be focusing on when making my decision. With the May 1 decision approaching, I'm afraid I may have to resort to a coin flip :/

Harvard v Stanford,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1cfc3t0/harvard_v_stanford/,3,5,2024-04-28 17:40:05,"Stanford vs Harvard

Hi guys, I‚Äôm super fortunate to have been admitted to both schools (co2028) in this last admissions cycle but now decision anxiety‚Äîespecially post Stanford‚Äôs admit weekend‚Äîis hitting me hard. I‚Äôd love any advice or perspectives on my situation.

I‚Äôm primarily interested in the humanities‚ÄîEnglish/history/international relations, but I also might try to double major at either institution with SymSys or Econ. Still not super sure abt post grad career (law school, consulting, foreign service, etc.) I‚Äôm also from the Bay Area (~40 min away from Stanny). Both cost the same. 

Pros for Stanny
1. Amazing weather + prettier campus (imo).
2. Close to home, so realistically,  I‚Äôd have a stronger support network and might be happier. I also know way more ppl going to Stanford coming from the Bay compared to Harvard, and it‚Äôs sig easier for me to visualize life as a student here. My sibling will be here next year too on a co-term. 
3. Weaker for the humanities
4. Nicer student facilities: better dining halls, free laundry, etc. Perhaps emblematic of Stanford just investing/caring more abt their undergrads? 
5. Quarter system. I like it idk. 
6. Easy access to study abroad programs that could mimic my desire for independence/living away from home that attracts me to Harvard. I‚Äôd want to study abroad at either school I attend. 

Pros for Harvard
1. Stronger in the humanities. Idk like all the amazing teen writers/figures I‚Äôve looked up to have in past years chosen Harvard when faced with this same cross admit decision which is making me pause. 
 2. Easy access to Boston so I could live my city girl dreams. Also close proximity to other colleges means maybe more diversity/less bubble. 
3. Distance from family + lack of safety net on the same level means I might grow more. I‚Äôve also always wanted to at least try living on the east coast, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôd actually enjoy the experience more than Cali. 
4. Better housing/dorm culture. Haven‚Äôt heard the best things about Stanford‚Äôs neighborhood system.
5. Worse food/weather/other things that might make daily life just a bit more uncomfortable/harder. 
6. Just a small iota more of general prestige outside of like CS/tech fields. 

Atp, I‚Äôm genuinely 50-50. Like I‚Äôve flipped a coin and felt ambivalent about landing on either one üò≠. Pls help. "

D1 Football Athlete: Duke Robertson Scholar (Full-Ride Merit Scholarship) vs Harvard vs Stanford vs Yale Hahn Scholar vs UPenn Wharton for Econ/CS,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1c9nm0s/d1_football_athlete_duke_robertson_scholar/,12,7,2024-04-21 17:34:20,"Hey everyone! I'm in quite a bit of dilemma currently with my top options. I received the full-ride Robertson Scholarship to Duke which allows me to cross-enroll at UNC Chapel Hill for a semester. However, I was also fortunately admitted to Harvard, Stanford, Yale w/ Hahn Scholarship (research funding), and the Wharton School at UPenn. 

For some background, I am a North Carolina native but I attend a private boarding school in the Northeast. I hope to play Division 1 Football and have received a preferred walk-on offer (PWO) to Duke & Stanford which means that I have a roster spot but will not be on athletic scholarship. I was also offered by Harvard, Yale, and UPenn to play D1 Football but the Ivy League doesn't offer full-ride athletic scholarships. 

I wanted some thoughts on my current state of mind: 

Right now, Duke is my top choice for college, but I'm fine with attending any of the 5 schools as I can pursue playing football and majoring in CS/Econ. The full ride Robertson merit scholarship mixed with the ability to play football at a Division 1 Power 5 FBS school would be a dream come true (as well as being close to home). I haven't received my aids offers from Harvard, Stanford, Yale, or Wharton but with the financial aid calculator, my EFC is \~45k to 55k per year. I know whatever school I chose, I will have access to great opportunities.

Career-wise, I want to go into High Finance (Investment Banking or Private Equity) in New York after graduation and hopefully pivot into Venture Capital in Cali or NC. I want to eventually come back to the Research Triangle Park (RTP) area in my late 20's or early 30's and create my own startup venture in the biotech space. My end goal is that I want to build generation wealth whether it may be investments in startups, real estate, etc.  

What I look for in a college is a collaborative environment, fun social scene, and great for entrepreneurship and finance/tech. I don't want anything too intense academically - I'm looking for a good balance of academics and college life. 

Please let me know if you all have any other insights! Getting an outside perspective is really helpful as I make this big decision."

Luckily another student was sitting in meeting room with a clear view and saw who took it. I don‚Äôt know the person personally but I was able to find them because they had just gone up to their floor by elevator and were talking loudly with a friend they were with. I confronted them just after they got into their apartment (had to knock) and they denied taking it. I reminded them that not only was there a witness, but there are cameras everywhere; they then continued to deny having had taken the order but asked me how much it was and if they could Venmo me. I said I didn‚Äôt want money I wanted my food. They denied more. I asked if they didn‚Äôt want to give me my food because they had already started to eat it. They said they didn‚Äôt take it and asked again if they could Venmo me.

At this point I was tired and didn‚Äôt want to argue over a $25 order. I gave him my Venmo and left. He venmoed me $30 and in turn I got his name.

I‚Äôm conflicted now because he‚Äôs my neighbor and I will likely run in to him often.

I was wondering which of the two freshman math sequences would be a better choice: math 22 or math 25? To give you some background, I am an international student (Canadian) with a decent background in STEM. I‚Äôve taken linear algebra and multivariable calculus in my senior year and did extremely well. The courses were fairly in-depth, but were mostly focused on computation than on abstract proofs (we did do some proof exercises, but nothing over the top). Thus, although I have a fairly solid foundation in single and multivariable calculus as well as linear algebra, my experience with proofs is very limited. That being said, I love math and would like to take a rigorous proof-based course. Therefore, naturally, I am considering taking 25 since that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about - proofs, proofs, proofs - as opposed to 22 which seems to be less abstract and more down-to-earth. However, my fear is that my lack of a strong math background could make life difficult. On top of that, I am considering taking physics 16 which is gonna require a crazy amount of work, so I am worried that a math 25 + phys 16 could turn out to be a killer combo, especially during first semester when I am trying to get used to the rhythm of Harvard courses.

Cons:

At Harvard, there is the MIT cross-registration aspect for some CS classes and the Harvard Innovation Labs. Stanford has many too including StartX. Financial aid for both is similar. Location isn't a main factor for me. Harvard does seem to have a bigger network/name brand. Like even Sam Altman (Stanford Alum) is hosting an AI pitch event at Harvard in the Fall.

I do plan to minor in Econ to go into quant if I don't pursue an AI startup in college. Boston does have the advantage for Econ. Another question/factor is I heard Stanford is like a bubble (\~1 hour from San Franciso) so not really integrated with Silicon Valley... while Harvard is integrated well within Boston I am not sure is there are enough AI startups.

I have some severe chronic pain I've been working through which is exacerbated by stress, and I need some more time to work in therapy and physical therapy so that I am not consistently bed-ridden. I don't feel physically, emotionally, or financially ready to start HGSE this year, and thought that deferral would be no issue.


Unfortunately, the school keeps telling me that they very, very rarely grant deferrals and that you need to build an extremely strong case for them to consider it. They also won't consider a deferral application until after decision day, forcing you to commit to attending even if your attendance is dependent on the deferral being approved. I've never heard of this, and am curious as to why a school would fight so hard to not have students defer if that is what they need to be successful. Does anyone have any advice or experience with this?


The stress of this has really worsened my pain this week, and I don't want to turn down what feels like the opportunity of a lifetime + I absolutely want to go, but I need time before I'm ready for school. I just feel backed into a corner.

Harvard or Yale?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1bs0lsr/harvard_or_yale/,39,60,2024-03-31 03:25:05,"Hey everyone! I don‚Äôt post a lot but I‚Äôm really conflicted right now and I need some input. Besides my interviewers, idk anyone who went to harvard or Yale and I was lucky enough to get into both! But now I‚Äôm struggling to choose :(

I can‚Äôt go to bulldog days or visitas (I might be able to go 1 day) because of my school musical, so I most likely have to decide without getting that experience! A little more context‚Äî I‚Äôm mixed (black+white), so diversity and finding a strong black community is important to me :)

Yale pros:

-beautiful campus (I‚Äôm a writer, so I really want to feel inspired by my surroundings but it‚Äôs not the most important thing obviously)

-food is really good; I‚Äôm also plant-based and dairy free so food is probably an important factor

-I‚Äôve heard Yale is a collaborative environment (I‚Äôve connected more w people from Harvard so far, however, so I‚Äôm a little worried about finding friends!)

-I‚Äôm a theater kid and Yale is Yale haha

-yale is less expensive (not by a crazy amount)

-yale has a better undergraduate experience. I love the idea of the first year dance and first year dinner and the residential college systemüòç

-overall Yale has been my dream school since like middle school, but I just don‚Äôt know anymore

Yale cons:

-location? I know people have said that New Haven is made out to be worse than it is so I would love some more opinions on the area!

-I wanna major in math maybe engineering, and yale isn‚Äôt the best with engineering if I go that route

-the biggest one: I feel a little more intimidated? It may just be in my head? If it weren‚Äôt for this feeling, I‚Äôd probably commit to Yale without second thought



Harvard pros:

-this is the biggest one: so far I‚Äôve felt less anxious talking to people going to Harvard‚Äî and I was added to a smaller gc so I got the chance to get to know people better!

-harvard is better for stem and almost every subject minus theater and maybe economics and law for grad school.

-my AO already reached out to me and my interviewer is one of the best people I met! (I think I just feel way more welcomed at Harvard so far idk. But idk if I should choose a school based off that?)

-MIT or Berklee music school dual enrollment (I sing and do music along with theater)

-the Boston location has more opportunities and Cambridge seems a bit safer?

-Harvard has a stronger name, but only by a little?


Harvard cons:

-the food, I‚Äôve heard some bad things

Harvard or Yale?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1bs1m6j/harvard_or_yale/,2,13,2024-03-31 04:18:20,"Hi! I was accepted to Yale REA and to Harvard during regular decision. As the title suggests: I‚Äôm thankful I get to make this choice but I‚Äôm really, really torn, and I thought I‚Äôd post on here to hear others‚Äô thoughts (any and all are appreciated!).

I will be attending both Visitas and Bulldog Days. I‚Äôm an  international student and being part of a supportive, welcoming environment/community is really important to me. I thrive on collaborative engagement as opposed to competition. I‚Äôm aware that a larger proportion of people end up choosing Harvard over Yale, but I‚Äôm really scared of the prestige factor tipping it over for me.

I‚Äôm a writer/poet and I‚Äôm planning to double major in English and something else (undecided). For now, it‚Äôs probably Econ or something adjacent to Econ. Since I‚Äôm not pursuing STEM, academics at both H & Y are looking pretty level to me. Some of my biggest questions are: 1) the difference in quality of undergrad life and 2) opportunities if I go into law school or consulting.

**Yale Pros**

* **Vibes**. In my mind, Yale is really collaborative and community-minded (again, not that Harvard isn‚Äôt, but that‚Äôs not its overarching rep or at least my impression of it). During my visits to campus, I felt this inexplicable, all-encompassing sense of belonging. In short: I love Yale, but I just don‚Äôt know anymore.
* **Gut feeling.** I applied REA to Yale because it‚Äôs my dream school, whereas I only applied to Harvard because I could. But I can‚Äôt help but think that I REA‚Äôd to Yale because I thought Harvard would be ‚Äúimpossible.‚Äù In a way, before getting accepted, I‚Äôve never thought of getting to know Harvard in the same way I‚Äôve come to know Yale.
* **Academics & literary scene:** There isn't a clear winner in terms of humanities, so I've heard.
* **Undergrad experience.** From what I‚Äôve learned, Yale has more of an undergrad focus than Harvard. For example, more direct access to professors. The residential college system is also so, so appealing, and I guess I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a Harvard equivalent?
* **I have more friends at Yale.** A trivial reason, I know, and I can always make friends at Harvard, but I find it comforting and honestly exciting that one of my best friends is going to Yale next year too. But, interestingly, someone I know IRL brought up how I technically have more friends at Yale because they only got into Yale (or chose Yale over Princeton/Stanford, etc.), not because they chose Yale over Harvard.

**Yale Cons**

* **Location and safety?** Is Yale really a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù like some say because there‚Äôs not much to do off-campus and/or it‚Äôs relatively unsafe?
* **Name recognition?** I‚Äôm under the impression that Yale doesn‚Äôt make people go ‚Äúwoah‚Äù like Harvard does. I know that logically this shouldn‚Äôt matter, but it‚Äôs still on my mind. I sound like such a snob; please bear with me.

**Harvard Pros**

* **Boston being a bigger, safer (I believe) city.** However, I attend high school in a town close to Cambridge and I don‚Äôt feel that attached to the city, so to speak. Will the difference between New Haven and Boston really be a disadvantage with respect to opportunities, people I‚Äôm going to meet, etc.?
* **Brand recognition.** Time and time I circle back to how Harvard is \*Harvard\*, if that makes sense. Coming from an Asian country, more people know Harvard, not Yale, and I guess I feel like I‚Äôd be ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù on that immediate wow factor? Not sure if this feeling will ever go away.
* Harvard Advocate! Really cool!

**Harvard Cons**

* Similar to someone else‚Äôs post earlier, I‚Äôm just really intimidated by the thought of being at Harvard. Imposter syndrome, ‚Äúwhat if my acceptance was a fluke,‚Äù all that.
* Atmosphere/culture. I‚Äôve spent the longest time thinking Harvard is more competitive and cutthroat, and while I know it‚Äôs not true for everything/everyone, I do wonder if that argument has merit.
* In general, I feel that people often choose Harvard just because of its brand name. But frankly, I think I‚Äôd hate myself if I let that be the biggest (if not only) reason.

Harvard vs UIUC for CS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1briv1q/harvard_vs_uiuc_for_cs/,13,14,2024-03-30 14:14:30,"I got into both (Illinois student) and I am trying to make my decision. I know that UIUC is ranked higher than Harvard for the field, but I prefer Harvard's culture (small school, traditional, etc). Harvard would also be significantly cheaper, and its well-rounded liberal arts curriculum is attractive to me.

I have more friends going to or already at Illinois, and I'd probably get more of the clich√© ""college experience""--along with some really incredible professors and research opportunities. CS at UIUC is within the Grainger College of Engineering, so I'd also have access to a lot of career fairs and other resources (a lot of F100 companies recruit at Illinois).

Could anyone help me figure this out?"

&#x200B;

**Me:**

Likelys to Harvard and Yale

Richmond Scholar

Possibly pre-med, would like to explore different opportunities. Considering MD, PhD, or MD/PhD

Parents are willing to pay up to $30k/yr for college, wouldn‚Äôt have to take out loans for any school

Considering a Math/CS/Statistics double major/concentration

Haven‚Äôt visited any schools yet

&#x200B;

**Harvard**

Concentration: Chemical and Physical Biology

&#x200B;

*Pros:*

Prestige + Connections/Networking

Close to home (I‚Äôm 40 minutes away)

Great financial aid; I‚Äôd only have to pay around $11k/yr (estimated)

Tons of hospitals and clinical opportunities available in Cambridge

Location. Tons of things to do in Cambridge all within walking distance

Great Bio/chem department‚Äìbetter than Yale

Idk if the housing system is a pro/con

Grade inflation

Great people that‚Äôd encourage me to work harder

&#x200B;

*Cons:*

Competitiveness

Imo the brick buildings are eh‚Ä¶

Hella tourists

Pressure to succeed

Some extracurriculars are competitive (and you can even get rejected)

Eh diversity (40% white, 9% African American)

Might be harder to secure research/clinical opportunities

Stress

Weather is eh

I‚Äôve lived in MA for 14 years I don‚Äôt know if I can take it anymore (I wanna explore somewhere new)

Idk why but I have a fear of failing here

Food looks mid :o

&#x200B;

**Yale**

Major: Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry

&#x200B;

*Pros:*

Less competition than Harvard.

Grade inflation

I‚Äôd love to get out of my state for a change and try living away from my parents

Love the campus so so much

Prestige/connections (comparable to Harvard lowkey)

I feel like the environment overall is a lot more collaborative

Love the residential college system

Food seems validd

Great people at Yale

&#x200B;

*Cons:*

Eh diversity (35% white, 7% African American)

Might be harder to secure research/clinical opportunities. Unsure if you can do research during freshman year

Bio/chem isn‚Äôt as good as Harvard‚Äôs but not bad by any means

20k/yr estimated net price

New Haven is kinda mid

Drinking oriented night life

&#x200B;

**University of Richmond**

Major: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

&#x200B;

*Pros:*

Full ride. Even enrollment deposit is free

$4,000 research/internship grant

Study abroad for free

Campus looks good (not as good as yale ofc). I really like the dorms

Closer knit community with smaller student body and class sizes I like how campus culture is less centered around drinking/partying and more around having fun indoors (at least from what I asked current students)

Scholar group is pretty diverse

Priority course registration

Can start research ASAP (like within a month on campus)

Extracurriculars and clinical stuff isn‚Äôt too competitive. Good campus resources

Not hard to get a good GPA

82% of students make it to med school (lower than harv/yale but still great; also some scholars have ended up at harvard and upenn med school)

I don‚Äôt know too much about the academics but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre bad

Already in the top percentage of students with the scholars program

&#x200B;

*Cons:*

Diversity is pretty bad (61% white, 6% black)

Lot less known

Richmond isn‚Äôt too walkable; not a great city for exploration and stuff

School so small that it can feel cliquey

Greek life (i‚Äôm not interested lmaoo)

‚ÄúRichmond Bubble‚Äù

&#x200B;

**Note: I also haven't done a ton of research and most of the stuff on here is from things I've heard or preconceived opinions. I may be wrong for a lot of these pros/cons so please correct me!!**"

I am from the Midwest (Illinois), and I applied early to Notre Dame and was accepted w/ full-tuition merit that reduces total cost to $72,000 (about $18k/year for room and board). On the other hand, I recently received a likely letter from Harvard, and I estimate (I don‚Äôt have the official financial aid offer at this point) it will cost about $170k total for 4 years.

Here‚Äôs the thing: Between small outside scholarships and family money for education, I have a total of $180k. I‚Äôm very, very grateful for this.

And‚Ä¶ The kicker is whatever I don‚Äôt spend on undergrad, my family will let me keep the difference for grad school (I want an MBA), a house down payment, or some other significant future expenditure. As a future econ student, there‚Äôs an opportunity cost to spending all the money.

I will major in finance at ND or economics at Harvard, hoping to go into Investment Banking. 

In my mind:

Harvard Pros:

Highest caliber faculty and students (i.e., intellectual vitality); diversity; prestige (I personally don‚Äôt care other than it may help me get a better finance job); Boston

Harvard Cons:

More rigorous (comparatively) and competitive culture to get into clubs, etc; less fun, no rah rah football (which I like); more expensive

Notre Dame Pros:

Strong community; Less competitive atmosphere; Well respected b-school; Dorm culture; Cheaper

Notre Dame Cons:

Somewhat close to home; Tolerable but ‚Äútoo Catholic‚Äù for my preference; less global recognition

Since the reputation of an institution will affect how people that are associated with it will be treated, are any of you worried about your future job prospects?
