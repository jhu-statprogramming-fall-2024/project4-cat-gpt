My goal is to launch it in next quarter to help students choose their classes more effectively, but I’m sharing it now to see if it can help students with Winter 2025 preregistration next week.

* *Can I get feedback on Professor Panagiotis Souganidis from the Mathematics department?*
* *What’s the weekly commitment for SOSC 11500 in the Social Sciences department?*
* *What’s a cool class I might enjoy if I’m interested in Medieval Studies?*

It’s still a work in progress – I’d really appreciate your feedback and questions I should make good at answering.

My question is if I should apply to transfer ED or rolling, not because I would second guess my commitment, but because my parents make over 150k a year. While this is true, they only have a certain amount that I am allowed to use for college and I am planning to go to med school. I don't want to graduate with 100k debt even before post grad so any insight would be great. I also want the best chance of getting accepted however and ED would obviously up my chances.

Am I asking too much from them for a short recommendation? Perhaps I am not as social a person as I should have been over the intervening 10 years but I wasn't sure that a PhD was in my path so I wasn't making the continuous social investment. 

I don't know. Any thoughts? "

I've received a job offer that requires a quick relocation, and I have only a few days to move to another state.

I remain broadly speaking opposed to capitalism -- in the specific sense of ""private ownership of the means of production"", not it's seemingly new sense of ""anything that's bad"" -- but neither as a student nor now have I ever found a good home for discussion and planning about how one would realistically build, in our lifetime, an alternative economic order. As far as I can tell, the existing ""radical"" groups on campus are either: 1) protest oriented, and protest whatever they can think of or 2) entirely caught up in academic ""theory"" and have no business sense at all.

I don't care for ""radical"" aesthetics. I have no particular loyalty to ""Marxism"". I **can** see a concrete, realizable future where worker cooperatives are more abundant, which leads to a richer, fairer, and more moral society. But building that future needs fewer retrospectives on fin-de-siecle Vienna and more movement capacity building in finance and tech. I'm not looking for a bunch of self-styled revolutionaries. I'm looking for a group of people who want to build, and be successful, and make our society more virtuous.

If anyone's picking up what I'm laying down, and you know of a group that fits the vibe I'm describing, I'd love a referral. If you don't, but might want to join a group like this, also let me know, whether undergrad, grad, or alumnus. If there are enough people interested, then we could create our own group."

Help required + Bad Experience with Financial Aid Office ,https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/1fwuhnf/help_required_bad_experience_with_financial_aid/,23,23,2024-10-05 16:38:28,"Hi everyone,

I’m an incoming international freshman with a full scholarship (including stipend and work employment) on paper. However, I face a significant hurdle: I need to pay nearly $5,000 in taxes, which ironically exceeds my family’s annual income. While some universities like Duke and Yale cover this cost for their students, it seems that this isn't the case at USD 10 billion hedge fund (UChicago).

I spoke with my financial aid officer, who provided some options, but none seem feasible. Loans aren’t an option due to my international status and financial situation, and the last suggestion was to take a leave of absence until my finances stabilize. Unfortunately, my parents will never earn more than $5,000, which means taking a leave would likely mean dropping out. It’s disheartening, especially since I applied through Early Decision and would have reconsidered if I’d known about this issue.

While $5,000 might not seem like much compared to the total cost of attendance, it represents a significant barrier for me. I’m doing my best to navigate this situation and have reached out to various campus resources (Reg, CCSS, OIA) for assistance, but I’m still struggling to afford essential items, including:

1. Winter clothes (a coat(Male ""L"" or ""XL"" (can try ""M"") and snow boots - 10 size)
2. Aktiv Chemistry subscription ($30)
3. A laptop (I have some funds from a previous Reddit post, but I can only afford a secondhand one)
4. Winter/Summer break housing and flight fare (the flight back to my home country is $2,000)
5. Academic and career-related books (I’m also interested in preparing for the Putnam competition but lack the necessary materials)

I understand that I’m an adult and responsible for my own needs, but I’m navigating this new environment for the first time and haven’t secured on-campus employment yet. I’m reaching out to see if anyone has advice or resources that could help. Any support or even just an upvote would mean a lot. I hope to find solutions with the help of generous alumni and members of this community.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

P.S. Here are some math books I’m hoping to get for the Putnam:

* \*Principles of Mathematical Analysis\* by Rudin
* \*Real Mathematical Analysis\* by Charles Pugh
* \*Problem Solving Strategies\* by Arthur Engel
* \*Putnam and beyond\* by Andreescu

Graduated with a STEM major in ‘22, have been working as a consultant since. 

Have been seriously considering applying to masters programs in the same field as my major to further pursue my studies. 

I did not during undergrad think this would be my route, so did not engage too much in research, or build too close a rapport with any one professor. 
The program is abroad, and I need two professors to write me purely academic performance related rec letters. One has agreed, very kindly.

I cannot for the life of me seem to be able to get a response from the other 3 I emailed. 
Is it possible my non-uchicago email is going to spam? In which case, how would I go about contacting? Old canvas pages, lol? Is reminding once, 1 week out from the original email, good etiquette, or is it different due to the chaos of start of fall quieter? One has a phone number - is it absurd to call? Emails have been (IMO) well formatted/reasonably concise.
These are all the subject-relevant professors, where I got good grades in that were not 1st or 2nd year. Should I instead ask non-subject related professors? 


Would appreciate advice/feedback. Would love to apply to these programs, but might be precluded from being able to do so based on availability of these rec letters. How should I go about this as someone 2, going on 3, years out of school.

Allergies? Could ragweed still be going on in Hyde Park/Chicago?,https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/1fui6ut/allergies_could_ragweed_still_be_going_on_in_hyde/,6,10,2024-10-02 14:57:42,"# 

Hi all

Two years ago this happened to me, and its happening again...I forget if it happened last year. But basically, I'll have my bedroom windows open for a week or so and be fine...then suddenly this past weekend, end of September, I wake up with insanely itchy nose and runny nose/sneezing. I changed the sheets and vacuumed/wiped the sill/floor by the window, and it improved. Then, I'm fine for two days, went for a run yesterday evening, and then only after I get back inside my apartment building, my right nostril (only one, never the left) becomes extremely sensitive, and I cannot help the constant runny nose and frequent sneezing that ensues. This has improved slightly, but is still going on today.

Two years ago I chalked it up to COVID, but I never tested positive. I've also never had a problem with ragweed on the east coast (NJ), so I figure it's unlikely to be ragweed here. But here we are again. I feel like if it was an allergen from outside bothering me on the inside of my apartment, I would also get symptoms outside, but I can't really say its an issue for me while I'm outside (if anything, my symptoms improve).

Can anybody relate? Does this happen to anybody this time of year as well? How do you take care of it? And if it is ragweed, when will it end?!?!"

I am taking MATH 15910 this quarter and was hoping to take accelerated analysis next quarter, since I have heard that it sets people up for success for future electives compared to regular analysis. My original plan was to take analysis in my third quarter after completing 20250 in my second quarter, however accelerated analysis is only offered in autumn and winter.

My next plan was to take 20250 and 20310 in my winter quarter, but I already have three classes and I only have a slot for one more, so I seem to be stuck in an impossible situation since overloading classes in my second quarter is not allowed and sounds like torture. I was also thinking of taking the next CS class in my spring quarter, but the catalog is not clear on whether it is offered then.

Is there any way I can get around this and be on my desired track? Or should I just take accelerated analysis in my second year? I would really prefer to take it next quarter, but if this is not possible and I am sounding naïve I understand. Thanks for all your help!"

I’m an incoming freshman and FLI at UChicago. While I understand that the university typically covers laptop costs, my entire stipend is going toward taxes due to my home country lacking a tax treaty. I reached out to financial aid, but unfortunately, I didn’t find a solution. I also inquired with CCSS, but they only offer short-term laptop loans (4 weeks per quarter). As an F1 visa holder, I cannot take external loans, and even if I could, I wouldn’t be able to repay them (because of economic reason).

Classes have already started, and I’m struggling without a laptop. I feel embarrassed asking for assistance with such an expensive item, but any help would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: I tried using the computers at Reg. Both Reg and CCSS don't seems a sustainable source. I applied for jobs. However, even if I get jobs, I would use it in my miscellalunus expenses (shampoo, laundry, winter clothes). Thus I don't have those option.

Marksmanship Club at UChicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/1fq5mj1/marksmanship_club_at_uchicago/,43,18,2024-09-26 20:08:28,"Hey everyone!

I am a new graduate student at UChicago, with a passion for shooting sports. I aim to establish a club centered around firearms with a focus on intercollegiate competitons.

I attended UIC for my undergrad, and established a marksmanship club there that grew to have over 70 members. The club is still active and regularly meets to pratice and compete against other marksmanship clubs.

I wanted to gauge the interest at UChicago and start a groupchat for fellow firearm enthusiasts and 2A advocates.

  
A couple of points:

1. All of the club's activities will be off campus at proper shooting establishments. I am fully aware of the no guns on campus policy and do not intend in any way shape or form to break this rule. This policy also existed at UIC and in the three years that the club has existed at UIC, we have never had any issues with anyone breaking this rule.

2. You do not need a FOID card to participate. While the state necessitates a FOID card in order to purchase a firearm, you do not need a card to shoot with other FOID card holders. Most ranges allow 2 non-FOID card holders per FOID card holder.

3. If you are an out of state resident, then you have even more rights than a non-foid card Illinois resident. You can shoot with a FOID card holder without any ratio limits.

4. If you are an international student, with a USA driver's license, you can shoot with no issues. If you are an international student, without a USA driver's license, and you are from some specific countrie (there is a list somewhere), you cannot shoot at some ranges. Some ranges do not care and some ranges do. The easiest way for you to shoot if you are from one of those countries is to get an Illinois state ID or Driver's License.

5. I intend for this club to be apolitical and independent of whatever conservative club may exist on campus who may share a similar sentiment regarding firearms. The club is to has no stance on any political issues that are not firearm related. 

6. I am still researching the process to start a club at UChicago. Depending on how complex this process is, I may just establish an independent special interest group or a formal club. At UIC, it took 3 months to establish the marksmanship club.

7. I found a lot of my close friends at UIC from the marksmanship club. If you are looking for cool friends, this may be a good place for you.

Alternatives to Handshake,https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/1fq7a5a/alternatives_to_handshake/,9,4,2024-09-26 21:19:10,"Hi guys,

I am a grad student new to the school who cannot use Handshake obviously. I went to several GradGargoyle's workshops and it seems that they only relay graduate level positions on the grad job board. Many of us came fresh out of undergrad and really need those entry-level summer internship positions. 

I wonder if there is a good alternative to Handshake that may come in handy in my case? I just want to participate in company info sessions at UChicago and get in touch with the campus recruiter, that's all. Also curious about whether Handshake is really useful or not (seems quite debatable).

Thank you in advance for any input!"

The other ones haven't responded to me yet, but considering that Self has the most sections of any sosc, I don't expect to get into the other two.

Right now, I'm registered for Power (there was no need to join a waitlist because there were so many spots open). According to my rejection email for Self, Classics is the only course besides Power that has open spots right now.

However, my courses this year are going to be very challenging, which is why I was hoping for a less intensive sosc. 

The add/drop page for all the sosc sections said to join their centralized waitlists and specifically said not to reach out to instructors for individual sections. However, I don't really know what else to do if I don't get in through one of the waitlists.

Has anyone else had this issue? Would it be worth emailing professors anyway?"

"Math Major, Analysis Sequence Question",https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/1fft96v/math_major_analysis_sequence_question/,3,16,2024-09-13 12:16:17,"Hello, I’m an incoming first-year who was placed into regular analysis. I am not allowed to get take Honors analysis, however I hope to be allowed to take accelerated. I understand that it is for my interest, but I am still disappointed, as I wanted to dive straight into the math major.

My question is, how behind do people having done regular/accelerated analysis feel/are compared to Honors analysis students in the earlier electives. Do the better math majors long term happen to have done Honors analysis? Does accelerated truly make a significant difference over regular (I see that it also uses Rudin, which maybe makes it closer to Honors?)?

I also would like to ask, is there any way of feasibly trying to either not fall too far behind Honors analysis folks (who I understand work at maybe double pace to regular)? In particular, is it possible that someone take 208 from 203/20310 (I imagine not, but just asking)?

Also, I saw from the course catalogue that (at least) 2 courses have prerequisites that exclude regular analysis takers, and only allow people having taken MATH 207 (Basic Functional Analysis 27200; Basic theory of Partial differential equations 27500). Does this sound accurate, given the department says that Honors does not impact one’s math major except time-wise?

Thank you!"

Professor Sanderson will be teaching ECON 19850 and 19950 this year. These courses do not count in any version of the Econ major other than one may count towards Perspectives in the Business Econ track if the students wishes.

I’m an incoming first-year student at UChicago, and I could really use some advice on my course schedule. I’m planning to major in Political Science and potentially double major in either Philosophy or LLSO, as I’m aiming for law school in the future.

Here’s what I’ve picked so far:

• **HUMA Core: Philosophical Perspectives**

• **MATH 15200: Calculus II** (to prepare for future Statistics courses)

• **PHSC 12400: The Chemistry of Big Problems with Prof. Bozhi Tian** (This will fulfill my Physical Science requirement combined with my AP Chem Credit)

I’m looking to add a fourth course that aligns with my intended majors and sets me up well for the future, especially since I’m trying to balance two majors. Here are a few courses I’m considering:

• **HIST 11301: Global British Empire to 1784: War, Commerce, and Revolution with Steven Pincus** (I’m hoping to petition for this to count as a PLSC elective)

• **PHIL 21002: Human Rights: Philosophical Foundations with Ben Laurence**

• **PLSC 25215: American Presidency with Howell**

• **SOSC 18400: Democracy: Equality, Liberty, and the Dilemmas of Self-Government I with McCormick**

My main concern is whether these courses might be too difficult for a first-year student. especially considering I couldn’t find detailed feedback on the professors’ grading practices. I want to avoid courses that might be overly challenging and could potentially affect my GPA.

Do you have any recommendations for a fourth course? Are there any introductory PLSC or LLSO courses or professors you’d recommend for someone in my situation? I’d really appreciate any advice or suggestions!

Thanks so much for your help!"

I’ve looked over the book used in the class and I know I can follow it. I think the hardest part will be convincing the school to let me take it. Can anyone give me some advice? Who would be a good person to talk to? Okay with hell, but is this absolutely impossible?"

I had a chipotle order for delivery when I was in North Campus Residentials, and another student took it within the few minutes it took me to get it (I over-obsess on time and walk over the second it's marked delivered). That means some girl swiped her card at the front desk and still decided to take my order. It couldn't have been a mistake because there was no other Chipotle order (I had to keep going back for updates with the desk worker).

I know it was a girl because the person who was working the front desk remembered who had taken it. He said he would speak to her the next time he saw her, but I highly doubt any student stealing food orders from inside the building after swiping in cares much for responsibility.

My family has gotten things stolen from bikes to our family car (yes, the entire thing, and yes, we got it back ditched and unusable) and now book bags, lanyards, and food. I despise personal thefts because there's no rationality for taking others' property.

Goes to show shitty people exist everywhere, even in more guarded areas like UChicago dorms.

I have never felt such a visceral disgust from petty theft, and I just hope karma exists.

by the way, I wanted to put this on a thread closer to when it happened but I didn't have side chat because it wasn't compatible with my phone

I'm an incoming first-year planning to major in physics, and I'm having some second thoughts about what classes I'm preregistering for. Initially, I was going to take a SOSC sequence in my first quarter, but after talking with my advisor, she recommended that I preregister for a CIV sequence instead. She mentioned that SOSC sequences tend to have more writing and a heavier workload (?), so it might be better to save it for my second year.

On second thought, I'm not sure if I really care about pushing SOSC back to my second year, and I've heard people say/post that taking SOSC before CIV helps with the writing skills needed. 

I’ve also read some posts where people advised against taking a first-year CIV because it could limit study abroad opportunities. But since studying abroad seems unfeasible with the three-quarter sequences required for the physics major, I'm wondering if that would even be an issue for me.

Is it a bad idea to take CIV instead of SOSC in my first year? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!"

CAAM or Econ Data Science?,https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/1esdh6k/caam_or_econ_data_science/,0,3,2024-08-14 21:36:33,"I'm a rising sophomore at UChicago, and I'm set on majoring in cognitive science. I'm interested in AI and machine learning and I want to get a PhD in cognitive science or computer science and do research in AI and machine learning.

However, I want to double major as well. I'm considering CAAM, standard Econ, or Econ spec Data Science. Which one should I choose?

The downside of CAAM is that if I choose CAAM, I won't be able to take many econ classes (I took Principles of Micro and I will only be able to take Principles of Macro in the future). However, I feel like majoring in CAAM will look better on my resume when applying to grad schools.

The downside of Econ/Econ Data Science is that I'm not planning on doing anything related to Econ in my future job. I'm not particularly interested in finance and stuff. But I do feel like I should take some econ classes because it's UChicago.

If I major in Econ/Econ Data Science, I'm also planning on minoring in computer science because I enjoy computer science. I don't want to major in computer science because I don't want to take systems classes.

Btw, math classes I've taken are 15250, 15300, and 19620.

Any thoughts?"

As you can probably tell already, I am a prospective Classics major, but I am also considering a second major in Art History or Religious Studies. I am hoping to knock out Latin right away while it is still fresh in my mind and to tackle Greek early on so that I can take Greek electives as an undergrad which I don't think would otherwise be possible if I want to study abroad my third year. I should also mention that I have two years of Greek experience from high school. 

  
Greek is the course I am the most uncertain about, and I am considering taking a SPAN or petitioning to take a RETH course instead.

Seeking Transfer Students' Support for Petition on New Transfer Credit Policy,https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/1epsj40/seeking_transfer_students_support_for_petition_on/,17,8,2024-08-11 18:59:54,"As transfer students, we received our credit evaluations last week and discovered that most of us received credit for only 1 or 2 quarter courses applicable toward the Core or our majors, with the majority of our credits designated as general electives, despite having taken 8 to 24 courses previously. We understand that the school has been denying calculus and writing credits for a long time, **but the new policy of not even considering transfer credits for CIV/SOSC/HUM sequences makes the situation significantly worse.** In previous years, major courses, especially in the humanities, were often counted as one of the CIV/SOSC/HUM credits, as it was generally hard to find an exact equivalence within the major. This year, 1) the new policy was not communicated to us a cycle earlier. Such a policy change should be announced well in advance to allow us to make informed decisions. 2) This policy change essentially forces us to complete all major courses and the Core in three or even two years, which is a significant and unanticipated burden.

As a result, I drafted a petition that proposes: **1) Reconsideration of the eligibility of rigorous courses for Core credits in HUM, CIV, and SOSC. 2) If this is not feasible, we propose that departments adjust their standards to reflect these changes in Core requirements**. **It is unfair to close all avenues for credit recognition. (Please see a more detailed explanation in the following Google doc.**

If you are in a similar situation, please log in with your .edu account to sign the petition at the end of the Google doc. **Reddit wouldn't let me post it here so please dm me for the link.** I'll also grant access requests if you can't log in to your UChicago account after confirmation. We believe that our collective voice can make a stronger impact than individual petitions.

Thank you for your support. Hopefully, together we can change their minds and build our education at UChicago on our previous efforts. (Please sign at the bottom and don't edit other contents or others' signatures! If there's anything you want to change please dm me!!)"

The UChicago Coptic Reading Circle has just begun talking about what we're going to be reading this coming year. If you read Coptic (even very poorly!) and are interested in doing so with others, we'd love for you to join us.

At present, there is no regular Coptic instruction at UChicago. Nevertheless, the language is relevant to some of us for our research or our religious lives, or is simply something in which we find great enjoyment. There can be a little bit of a gap between textbooks like Lambdin's or Layton's and independent reading of untranslated texts. The Coptic Reading Circle is a friendly and supportive group of readers who enjoy helping one another to cross that gap. Members include UChicago masters and doctoral students, faculty, and unaffiliated community members. Last year we had no undergraduate participants, but undergrads are very welcome.

Last year we read monastic correspondence from the sixth century, an as-yet-untranslated ostracon from the same period, a sermon by Apa Shenoute on necromancy (tl;dr: don't do it), and a fifth century meditation manual. We've just begun talking about what we'll read in 2024–2025. We usually prioritize work that contributes to members' research, so if there's some Coptic document that you'd *really* like to read for your doctoral dissertation, your BA thesis, or a paper you're working on for publication, there's a very high chance that we'd be happy to read it with you.

If you'd like to join us, please send me a DM with your e-mail address and I'll add you to our communications. If you don't yet know Coptic but have a *serious* interest in learning, let me know: There is *some* possibility that we'll organise a Coptic learning group.

I'll post to this subreddit again in early October as we're scheduling our first meeting for the year. Enjoy the rest of your summer!"

I was wondering how much that would matter for someone who, by winter of 2025, wouldn’t have taken calculus since junior year of high school (2023). Or would it be worth racking it on in autumn. Planning to be a biological sciences major. Thanks!"

I saw on another post that it wasn't offered in spring. 2) Assuming I do well in the higher level math placement and qualify for 20250 abstract linear algebra, should I replace 14200 in Spring or make any other adjustments? 3) I've heard that numerical linear algebra helps more with economic applications, and since both numerical and abstract LA fulfill CAAM requirements, should I even take abstract linear algebra in my first year? 

If I want to improve my chances of getting internships (finance, data science) for next summer, should I take harder and major oriented courses as opposed to completing core requirements? Or is this really risky cuz it would hurt my gpa and hurt my odds instead. On the other hand, if I want to optimize my chances of landing summer math research and REU the year after next, should I study for the placement to take analysis in my first year.

I got an A for calculus 1, linear algebra, and business stats in my previous uni, but I have minimal experience with calc 2 and above.

Super stressed as I’m switching from a business school and am considering this path only recently. Still uncertain about what I want to pursue academically/career-wise. Here’s some questions I have:

1. Would it be okay to take the 150s calculus sequence (starting calc 2)? I don’t think I can do the honours sequence, as I’ve learned minimal calculus 2 and higher in HS and only calculus 1 in my previous uni. This means I also won’t take honours analysis (but can take advanced num analysis and relevant electives for master’s and/or quant), so I’m worried, as people recommend maximum rigour.

2. Since I’ll only complete the calculus sequence this academic (second/soph) year, I will start the analysis sequence only in my third year, which I heard is bad for graduate school applications. What are my options? Will I have to take a gap year to apply? If so, would the gap year put me at a disadvantage? I’m considering master’s in financial mathematics, statistics, or CAAM.

Edit: By the end of my junior/third year, I could complete calc 2-3, intro to proofs, analysis 1-3, numerical lin alg, disc math, intro CS 1-2, theory of algorithms, and maybe intro to prob + elective. Could also do mechanics and magnetism courses

3. What are the key differences between the 4+1 programs and standard master’s programs? Would it be wise to apply for the standard programs, since they’re longer (meaning extra internship) by a year, I believe, especially because I don’t have an internship for my first summer and started considering quant only recently? Since the 4+1 programs are internal, shouldn’t it be okay to take analysis only in the third year, since UChicago knows that I will eventually finish all the relevant coursework?

Thank you!"

What Does UChicago Think of St. John’s College?,https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/1edzkv5/what_does_uchicago_think_of_st_johns_college/,13,8,2024-07-28 04:52:05,"Hello, Chicagoans!

One of the most interesting things I found out while researching St. John’s College in Annapolis was how the college is linked with UChicago over the formation of the Great Books Curriculum (or Core Curriculum for UChicago) back in the early 1930s. Even more surprising was that when I looked up great books colleges, UChicago and St Johns have always been at the center of the conversation.

This led me to wonder what the students of UChicago think of when they think about St John’s, that is if they even think about it. What comes to mind of over-stressed students of UChicago when they look to the college which is always at risk of becoming a war trophy for the Naval Academy? What comes to mind to the sleep deprived urbanites of UChicago when they come across their equally sleep deprived counterparts in Santa Fe and Annapolis?

Problems with BedLoft rental of Dorm refrigerator/ microwave….,https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/1e7khn9/problems_with_bedloft_rental_of_dorm_refrigerator/,7,4,2024-07-20 01:50:42,"Has anyone had problems when renting a dorm fridge/microwave unit with BedLoft, the company that UChicago works with to supply ‘approved’ units? Have you been contacted that your unit is missing and you are being charged $400? I got this unpleasant surprise last week and am wondering if I’m being scammed? 
   
I moved out of Campus North, as required, on Saturday, May 25 by 3 pm. On July 11th, I received an email from BedLoft informing me that the unit I had rented for the 2023-24 year was missing, claiming it was not in my room when they went to pick it up, and they are charging me $400!   My fridge/ microwave unit was ABSOLUTELY in my dorm room when I moved out on Saturday, May 25th at 3 pm (my roommate had moved out the previous day).  I confirmed with my RA, when she came by my room on 5/25 to inspect, that the way it works with BedLoft is you leave the unit in your room and BedLoft picks it up, no need to arrange pick up with them. This very process and convenience BedLoft touts as one of its selling points  — pay in advance for the year, tell them your dorm and room number, and they deliver it before you arrive and collect it after you move out.   I believe dorm access is turned off after 5/25,  so there was no way I could stay around and confirm the unit was picked up, which is ludicrous anyway. 

This feels like a scam or at best BedLoft has internal problems with their “on-site team” which
does the pick-ups. After many frustrating emails and calls, nothing is resolved — they’ve created a new ‘ticket’ for their team to go back to Campus North to look for the unit. No budging in waiving the $400.

UChicago’s housing department, which I contacted, said there is nothing they can do about it. 

So I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar situation with this company or has any thoughts on how to proceed?

Careers in Business vs Careers in Entrepreneurship ,https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/1dihrdb/careers_in_business_vs_careers_in_entrepreneurship/,1,3,2024-06-18 04:09:07,"Overall I like the Careers in Business better because of the Trott Business Program/Emerging leaders and Financial/Private Market Programs. However, the College New Venture Challenge and Polsky Center access through Careers in Entrepreneurship seem great. My questions are:

1: Is it possible to take part in more than one “Careers in”?
2: Is it possible to take part in more than one program inside careers in Business? (Trott + Financial Markets, for example)
3: Is it possible to participate in the College New Venture Challenge and access the Polsky Center without being in Careers in Entrepreneurship?

Thank you!"

chemistry: gen chem vs honors chem (non chemistry major)
