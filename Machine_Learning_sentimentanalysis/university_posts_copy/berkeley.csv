If a tree falls on me on campus can I get compensated?,https://i.redd.it/9a9qh81h152e1.jpeg,207,44,2024-11-20 23:07:00,"Asking because today I was walking to discussion when I heard a big cracking noise. I turned around just in time just in time to watch a tree - not just a branch, but the entire tree - tip over and fall right where a bunch of students were walking. Thankfully nobody was hurt, but the closest guy couldn't have been more than three feet away and given that the weather will be like this for another week or so it got me wondering. I'm definitely a person that notices trees more than most people already but now with this context I can see a lot of potential accidents waiting to happen with the trees on campus, especially the Coast Live Oaks which have very precariously twisted branches. Will the university at least cover my medical bills if I get hit while walking to class? 


P.S. the tree that fell is an American Sweetgum! Surprising to me because I've never seen that species fall before"

So as I reiterated last time, greek life in general at Cal is pretty dead compared to other colleges but it‚Äôs really the only place where you can have both the work hard mentality and party hard, especially if you‚Äôre in greek life and into the ‚Äúsorority and fraternity‚Äù experience. **Just a warning**, these are all just my personal opinions and what I think the general idea is of greek life fraternities at berkeley. Even though I dropped my sorority recently, I won‚Äôt do sorority rankings rn since it may be biased, but pls drop them in the comments.

Disclaimer: these are all my personal opinions and each fraternity has its pros and cons and this list does not reflect everyone's opinions!

**T1**: Zete\*, SAE\*, KA, Phi Psi

**T2**: ATO, Pike, TKE, Fiji\*, DKE\*

**T3**: ~~Chi Psi~~, SNU, ZBT, PKS

**T4**: Phi Tau, Sig Chi, AquaDelt

**T6**: PhiDelt, PiLam, Sigma Pi

**T7**: Theta Xi, ~~PiKapp~~\*, ASig

\*Unaffiliated with UC Berkeley

If the name is crossed out that means that they were disbanded.



Rising üìà - frats which their reputation has been improving (more social events, better brothers etc.):

KA, Phi Psi, TKE, SNU, ZBT, PKS, AquaDelt, Theta Chi, Theta Xi  


**Falling** üîΩ - frats which their reputation has been worsening (less social events or rapey etc.):

SAE, Fiji, DKE, Chi Psi, Sig Chi, AEPi, DU, PiLam



Once again, these are my personal opinions and as a junior I've seen these house rankings fluctuate a lot but those are my rankings for this semester. **Honestly each house works for different people** but if you're thinking about trying it out you should definitely check out rush in August or Janurary and as many houses as you can. There are some good brothers and also the bad in every house but see what fits your vibe and go for it! I know that this sub hates greek life but I just wanted to put this out there for anyone who might be interested. Let me know your comments and if you want a more detailed explanation and the general vibes of each of these houses.

I‚Äôm a student food service worker, The people that will benefit from this action are my colleagues, people that I know personally and people whose character I can strongly vouch for. They‚Äôre the people who clean the floors you walk on and cook the meals you eat. The least you can do for them is to not eat at the dining halls for two days. 

There should be food and water at the protest spot itself, if you need to eat and can‚Äôt afford Berkeley prices (understandable). Furthermore, if you need a cheap meal (<8 dollars) you can get the chipotle kids build your own for like 5 bucks with a free drink and chips, and fresh rolls is also super super cheap. Both can be found on Telegraph right in front of sproul plaza.

Unrelated, but I‚Äôve come down with a terrible cold and will not be coming to work on those days. What a wacky coincidence!

Dr. Oz is Trump's pick for Administrator of the U.S Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gvj0oc/dr_oz_is_trumps_pick_for_administrator_of_the_us/,116,37,2024-11-20 06:07:26,"And WWE co-founder¬†Linda McMahon¬†is his pick for education secretary. Along with all the other picks (Gaetz for Attorney General, and RFK Jr. for head of the Department of Health and Human Services)‚Äî well, I think we're off to a rolling start. 

Absolutely nothing can go wrong here, right? I mean, Matt Gaetz only has witness testimony against him saying he paid a 17-year old for sex, but it's not like we need a law-abiding citizen to occupy the most important legal position in the country, no? RFK Jr. is famously (or perhaps infamously) an anti-vaxxer, but I'm sure that's not going to affect how he runs things at the health department. Oh, and who wouldn't want someone known for hawking bogus supplements to seniors on his show through the use of the 'MD' next to his name to run the federal healthcare programs which primarily cater to the same age group as his old audience? I mean, the man has experience.

Everything is absolutely fine. I'm just going to go plug in my toaster next to my slowly-filling bath, and then contemplate how relaxing the next four years of competent administration are going to be. Yep... it's all going to be good.

  
Note: You can disagree with the sarcastic sentiment behind this post, and I'd love to be proven wrong in this upcoming presidential term about how things will go. However, you can't deny the picks are kind of ironic in a bad way, and thereby cause for at least some concern. That is all."
Just another Berkeley history fun fact:,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gvhw4h/just_another_berkeley_history_fun_fact/,136,44,2024-11-20 04:59:13,"Not many people know this because much of Berkeley's academic fame is tied to STEM and more traditional humanities like english, poli sci, history, and sociology.  Berkeley's philosophy game is top notch as well, and they actually had two of, imo, the top six or seven greatest philosophers America has ever produced: John Searle and Judith Butler.

John Searle was very famous back then. He was known for the Chinese Room thought experiment, which we can definitely use right about now with the threat of AI.

Judith Butler was probably the originator of the pronoun/gender phenomenon that has taken over the world.

Just another reminder of how incredibly well-rounded and important your school is.

My APR says that my ‚Äúsenior residency requirement‚Äù isn‚Äôt fulfilled, that I must have 2 semesters at Berkeley AFTER I reach 90 units. I‚Äôm currently taking 5.68 units from CC this semester, and 17 units from Berkeley, so after this semester I will have 106.36 units. 

After next semester I will have more than 120 units and meet all my other requirements to graduate. I‚Äôm really stressed and freaked out because I can‚Äôt figure out what the senior residency requirement is and if this semester counts or not, because it exceeds 90 units this semester (not sure if this means I need to take another sem after the next one??)

I'm thinking of pursuing a simultaneous degree in chem bio and microbial bio (CoC and CNR). However, I have a question regarding the semester limit for CNR. CoC doesn't technically have any semester limit/unit cap and so I was planning to extend my graduation date when time comes, but CNR has a semester limit of 8. On the CNR website, a requirement for pursuing a simultaneous degree in that college is to ""Be able to complete the major within the semester limit. Students who entered as freshmen are expected to graduate in a total of 8 semesters (summers excluded).¬†"" Does that mean I'd have to graduate with my simultaneous degree in 8 semesters or I ONLY have to complete the CNR major in 8 semesters? If it's the latter, I was planning to prioritize completing the microbial bio requirements within 8 semesters and whatever is left for upper divs for my chem bio major would be completed within an extra semester or two.

Any input is greatly appreciated!"

I'm an applied math major and am currently taking math 55 with Professor Srivastava. So far, I've done pretty badly on both midterms even with a good amount of studying and effort for both. I enjoy math and writing proofs, but to be honest I suck at it. I feel its difficult to do the creative step and make astute observations that advance your proof, and this is only exacerbated through the intense time pressure of exams. I'm not sure if it's my studying strategy or simply because I'm not intelligent enough to be logical or creative for math. Some people have told me that math is difficult because it's fundamentally changing the way you think, and honestly I feel that sort of premise is impossible for me.

I've heard from some friends that your performance and enjoyment in math 55 determines your performance and enjoyment in upper-div math classes, which is making me super worried about whether or not I should still be a math major. I know there still is the final which can clobber a midterm, but at this point I don't even know if I'll get a B-, which might be my lowest grade so far.

Genuinely, what should I do???"

Most of them are outdoors, and it's going to be a week of on-and-off-again rain, but still worth keeping in mind. There are both campus and off campus events. 

A historical note: A century ago the Big Game was held at Memorial Stadium on November 22, 1924. That's exactly a century ago, this Friday. Both teams came into the game undefeated. Cal was 7-0-1, Stanford was 7-0-0. Cal had won the previous five Big Games. The coaches were two legends in college football, Genn ""Pop"" Warner for Stanford, and Andy Smith at Cal, in his 9th coaching season. This was the era of the ""Wonder Teams"" at Cal who were essentially playing at perennial national championship levels most of that time.

It was a warm day, and very hot inside the Stadium during the game. A lot of people passed out from the heat, and had to have medical assistance. An estimated 78,000 people crowded into the Stadium itself (including seating on temporary bleachers erected above the east rim, behind the student section), and another 20,000 people without tickets trampled down ""Tightwad Hill"" above the Stadium to watch.  This was thought to be at the time the largest crowd that had ever watched a college football game to date.

The teams battled to a 20-20 tie (no overtime in that era, so the game ended at 60 minutes, whatever the score was). 

That left Cal with a 7-0-2 season, and Stanford with a 7-0-1 season. 

Stanford went on to play Notre Dame in the Rose Bowl, losing to Knute Rockne and his ""Four Horsemen"" by a score of 27-10, and finishing 7-1-1.  Cal set up a final game against Pennsylvania, also at Memorial Stadium, for New Year's Day, 1925. Cal beat Penn 14-0, so the Bears ended the season 8-0-2. Penn finished the season at a very impressive 9-1-1, so both Cal and Stanford were playing the elite in that era.

Data C8 vs Stats 20,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gv3c1w/data_c8_vs_stats_20/,1,2,2024-11-19 17:54:56,"I‚Äôm trying to decide whether to take Data C8 or Stats 20 in the Spring. I‚Äôve heard that C8 had a larger course staff and that it‚Äôs generally more enjoyable, but also that Stats 20 was recently modernized.

For more context, I‚Äôm planning on applying to both CS & DS in the fall, meaning I need to take Data 8 to finish all the prereqs. I‚Äôve already taken CS61A and CS61B, and I have a lot of programming experience, although not with stats visualization admittedly. So, I‚Äôm worried Data C8 programming instruction will be mostly redundant for me. Conversely, I‚Äôve never taken a stats class (even in high school).

I am taking Calculus 2 and my first C++ class. My math class is going great, but my programming class not so much which is my major prep class.

I currently hold a high D, fortunately my professor graciously gives us extra credit opportunities which I have been taking advantage of so with what I have as of now with extra credit included, I am at about a mid C, but the semester isn‚Äôt over. 

I want to transfer to UCI, UCLA, UCB, or SJSU all for Computer Engineering. I don‚Äôt know what would look worse, a C or failing it and retaking it. I feel confident I can at least get a B next semester, but I don‚Äôt want that F on my GPA or transcript. I already have 2 W‚Äôs, one of which from this very semester. I am also worried about my financial aid because I am non traditional and I really need it.

My current GPA as it holds is a 3.8, assuming my grade in my math class is stationary and I get a C in my programming class then I will be at a 3.5. I know the UC‚Äôs are holistic based on their admission decision. I still have a chance to at least pass, but would a C in a major prep course be fine or fail it and retake it next semester for at least a B? These past several months outside of school has almost killed me, very brutal life is. I do plan to talk to counselor as soon as possible, from what I can see on my college‚Äôs website, I can retake the class, it probably won‚Äôt affect my GPA, but I am not sure if that F will be on my transcript or GPA.

How many EE classes does one take in EECS compared to CS? Are EE classes required for the 40 credit upper-level classes? Are all of the classes traditionally available in CS available to EECS majors?

(Also, more practically, how does the acceptance rate differ between the two colleges?)

My nest mate is convinced I'm trying to hook up with him on Squirrelr,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gs3fkv/my_nest_mate_is_convinced_im_trying_to_hook_up/,103,8,2024-11-15 18:42:22,"So apparently my nestmate thinks I‚Äôm trying to hook up with him on Squirrelr.

Here‚Äôs what happened: I was at Sproul Plaza late last night grabbing food out of the garbage cans, minding my own business, when he starts blowing up my phone. First, he sends me this weird screenshot of a Squirrelr profile that, according to him, looks like me. Okay‚Ä¶ bold assumption, but sure. (I mean, the guy in the profile had brown fur and a big tail--I mean, it's true, I have a pretty big ""tail"", too--and fluffy ears, but all of us look like that...especially on the days like this week that a researcher studying Furries comes to campus and gives a talk). 

Then he claims that because I was ‚Äúat Sproul‚Äù at the same time as this random squirrel, it must be me. Like bro, squirrels skitter through Sproul Plaza all the time, climbing the sycamore trees and people's legs and rooting through garbage and doing cute begging for handouts‚Äîit‚Äôs not some exclusive private tree for just me and your Squirrelr matches.

The acorn on top? He confronts me about it when I get home to our shared tree hole, chittering at me like some detective interrogating a suspect. I tell him I was at Faculty Glade (which I was earlier, thank you very much, the nut crop is great there this year), but he‚Äôs still stuck on this Squirrelr fantasy like it‚Äôs the Da Vinci Code.

Now he‚Äôs talking about a tree transfer because he thinks I‚Äôm the weird one? Honestly, I‚Äôm just trying to live my life (which, TBH, is only going to last another year or two, squirrels don't have long lifespans) without getting dragged into his delusions. Should I transfer trees, maybe move down to the oaks near the Track Stadium, just to avoid whatever this is?

P.S. This is also not the first time he‚Äôs done something like this‚Äîhe‚Äôs got some kind of knack for turning normal situations into these conspiracy theories like someone is secretly picking all the good acorns on campus and taking them to feed to Stanford squirrels.

Sign up now: [https://center.houserabbit.org/get-involved/foster](https://center.houserabbit.org/get-involved/foster)¬†

We only ask for 2 week foster commitment. We have so many sweet rabbits who would love to spend time in a foster home with you and your family! We'll match you with a rabbit who's right for your interest and experience. Help make this season brighter for an HRS rabbit!

**What We Provide**: We'll equip you with all the supplies you need to get started‚Äîincluding an x-pen, litter box, bedding, food pellets, hay, blankets, and bowls for food and water. As a foster, you also receive a 15% discount at the HRS Hop Shop if you'd like to purchase any additional toys or treats while you foster.

**What You Provide**: The time, space, love, and care your foster rabbit needs, along with their daily greens (approximately $5-10 per week). Getting socialization in a foster home is so important, especially for rabbits who are shy or have other behavior needs, and helping them become more comfortable with people. You can help a foster rabbit blossom into the wonderful house rabbit they're truly meant to be!

I would feel so bad dropping out after showing them videos of commencement and seeing their excitement and them saying they can't wait to see me walk the stage... But, my whole time at Berkeley I have not found my passion nor do I have any interest in the classes I take. I've changed major many times already and still haven't declared. I was ready to push back my graduation date, but now I think I might fail the pre reqs this semester again... I can't blame my grades entirely on everything that's happened to me this year but I just can not focus for the life of me and I do badly on exams even though I know the material. it's like everything goes away from my mind the moment I have to do an exam. 

  
I don't know what I want to do with my life. But I know not getting a degree right now would be bad. Of course, me trying to get a degree right now, would also be bad. I'm so depressed and i'm too scared about failing my courses, every time I think about my grades I get a panic attack. It's not looking good no matter what.  
I was thinking of maybe leaving for a year and then trying to come back? Maybe take some  CC courses or just a break. It sounds silly but I only came to college because everyone I met in my life has said ""go to college"". So I did. but now I fear that I am too far in to just drop out... I don't know. I'm just scared. lol I spent 4 years here already. I feel so wasteful of my time. Especially since my parents are relying on me to graduate so I can ""start making money"".

Any advice? :( or am I just dumb..."

1.

In my home uni we did not explicitly study calculus or economics.  Given this exchange will be during Junior Sophister is it a guarantee that these courses show up and if/so, how challenging are they given minimal prior knowledge.  Does it differ from campus (UC San Diego is another option).

I'm a full-time student at UCI and was looking into taking an upper division Summer course at Berkeley this last Summer. I had added the class to my cart but to my understanding, never even checked out or enrolled. I eventually never even ended up taking the class because my Regents and Middle class scholarships from UCI wouldn't transfer and the course was absurdly too expensive for me to ever take (my current tuition at UCI is about $200 per unit and this was ten times more expensive). I don't even remember what the class was for. I never once enrolled, opened canvas, or completed a single assignment. To my knowledge, I didn't even know that I was enrolled in that course. 

Last month, though, I received an email from Berkeley billing saying that I owed $2,311.50? This is a complete shock to me as I don't even believe I enrolled in the course and if I had been, I should have been dropped for not participating in it.

Can't you drop a summer course beyond the deadline + Can professors or staffs at Berkeley be evil?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gqvi70/cant_you_drop_a_summer_course_beyond_the_deadline/,0,2,2024-11-14 03:17:48,"Hi, this is a complicated issue and may involve some overthinking, but if anyone has insights or knows of similar situations, please chime in.

I believe it should be possible to drop a summer course retroactively, especially since my course lapsed into an F due to an administrative error.

According to the summer program website, it says, *""You may seek to drop a summer course beyond the deadline after discussing it with your college advisor.""*

However, my advisor seems suspiciously opposed to this, even though an administrative error gave me the wrong deadline, causing the course to lapse into an F, and despite the fact that I was dealing with medical issues at the time.

He mentioned that both the deans and the UHS are also against allowing me to drop the course.

Could this be some kind of covert punitive measure specifically targeted at me?

I feel they‚Äôre being retaliatory and want to retain that F as a way to prevent me, as a victim, from filing a formal complaint.

For example, I had previously warned the school and a tenured professor that I might pursue a lawsuit for not honoring my DSP accommodations, which led me to take extra years to graduate. The professor in question holds the title of Chancellor's Professor and seems influential to Berkeley‚Äôs academic reputation. I‚Äôm worried I may have ""pushed the wrong button,"" and now the school is intent on protecting her, I think.

Some might call me paranoid, but I already saw this professor ""turn the tables"" on me when she was accused of violating DSP accommodations. Every DSP staff member suddenly began siding with her. She teaches Abnormal Psychology.

I acknowledge that she‚Äôs influential and has contributed much to the school, but are Berkeley undergraduates merely resources to be used?

Why does the school keep breaking rules and promises while punishing victims to cover up their own wrongdoing?"

"America Sold its Soul, and it's Our Fault",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gqq8jf/america_sold_its_soul_and_its_our_fault/,0,10,2024-11-13 23:01:18,"The main reasons why people voted for Trump were attributed to the state of the economy and ""lofty social issues"", referencing LGBTQ+ interests and reproductive rights. However, state-level abortion rights were passed in 7 of the 10 states. Among those were two swing states, Arizona and Nevada, which both passed ballot measures to approve abortion rights in their respective territories. Missouri and Montana, both red states, also approved access to abortion.

It's a fair assumption that Americans do care about reproductive rights enough to vote in favor of them, but still continue to support Trump. Trump's most effective campaign ad was the ""Harris is for They/Them, and Trump is for us."" Which shifted voter opinions drastically in swing states.

Not to state the obvious at this point but I think America is tired with the war on culture, and I agree with the sentiment that the divide in this country started before Trump. Let's be real, it is that Trump continues to divide this country but it was woke culture that kicked it off.

When you have a demographic that does things like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gelcdg/activist_dumps_tomato_juice_all_over_conservative/) and fundamentally works to alienate those that don't share their same views, it should come as no surprise that the ones you shunned are going to form their own ""losers club"", which makes up a significant portion of the population, and work to oppose your, let's face it, *imposing* agenda.

In the face of oppressed speech and a war on culture, America turned to someone unafraid to speak and say outlandish things because, to them, it is liberating to see the expression of a counter-counter-culture in action. People want to speak their minds without fear of being shunned or ""canceled"" for it.

The following are facts, truths that are unalienable aspects of the reality we live in: Trump is a narcissist, Trump is a racist, Trump is a rapist, a pathological liar, convicted felon, he incites violence, spreads misinformation like it's COVID, pressures foreign powers into election interference, and was way too close to Epstein than any one of us should be comfortable with.

...but America still voted for him. We've elected a morally bankrupt narcissist to office that's apart from your typical politician. With the onset of Project 2025, time will only tell what Trump's plans have in store for us. If it's anything like last time, we can expect more civil unrest, a fraudulent executive branch, the normalization of racism, sexism, misinformation, and much more degeneracy.

And make no mistake, Trump is a monster but it was not the right who made him who he is today. Trump's biggest ally was the far left."

Campus speaker claims online video games lead people to cybercrime. (WTF),https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gpv3v9/campus_speaker_claims_online_video_games_lead/,22,9,2024-11-12 20:50:29,"I'm having trouble thinking how this talk is happening at Berkeley. The premise is that video games are bad because when people play games, they then mod the games, and then they start using cracked games, and that all leads to hard core cybercrime. IMO, it's a load of garbage that stereotypes all game players to be immoral hackers. It's ignorant and discriminatory.

  
The Usable Security and Privacy Group at ICSI proudly presents:  
  
**Title:**¬†XP points to level up: Gaming as a ‚Äògateway‚Äô activity to cybercrime.  
  
**Speaker:**  
Yanna Papadodimitraki, Cambridge Cybercrime Centre, Dept of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge  
  
**When:**¬†Nov. 14, 2024,¬†2:00-4:00 pm PST  
  
**Where:**¬†International Computer Science Institute, 2150 Shattuck Ave, Suite 250, Berkeley, (in the SkyDeck Building next to the Downtown Berkeley BART station)  
  
**Abstract:**¬†Law enforcement in the UK (and the EU) often cite gaming as a ‚Äògateway‚Äô activity to cybercrime, especially for young people and hackers. This follows the hypothesis of a linear progression from gaming to cybercrime, based on the gateway drug theory. Drawing from interviews with and documentary material by law enforcement and the notion of criminalisation, Yanna explores the conceptualisation of gaming as pathological and the role of police practitioners and police practice in this process. More specifically, she examines how gaming is thought to introduce young people to game modification and, subsequently, to low-level and serious cybercrime, and how such perceptions are popularized in law enforcement and operationalized in cybercrime interventions.  
  
**Bio:**¬†[Yanna Papadodimitraki¬†](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/yp301)is a Research Associate at the Cambridge Cybercrime Centre (Dept of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge), an interdisciplinary research centre hosting computer scientists and criminologists focusing on security, cybercrime, and digital harms. She has worked in criminal justice both as a researcher and a practitioner during which she developed an interest in interdisciplinary research and research-practice collaboration. Through the years she has been involved in research projects on cybercrime, security, history of hacking, youth offending, and offender rehabilitation.

Reasonable schedule for EECS transfer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gq71ja/reasonable_schedule_for_eecs_transfer/,0,6,2024-11-13 06:50:47,"Hey dawgs,

I was planning on taking the following classes upon transferring to EECS (**not guaranteed of course** but if successful, I've already done EECS 16A and the Ethics / AC / 2 upper div H/SS). Would this be a reasonable schedule to graduate in one year, or is extending it good?

I'm aiming to use my free units for the 120 for graduation to get a data science minor (I have Data 8 articulated):

Entering with 82 units total:

# Summer 2025 (82 + 8 = 90)

* CS 70
* EECS 16B

# Fall 2025 (90 + 16 = 106)

* EECS Upper Div 1/5
* EECS Upper Div 2/5
* Data C100
* DS Minor - Tech Elective

# Spring 2026 (Final year, 106 + 16 = 122)

* EECS Upper Div 3/5
* EECS Upper Div 4/5
* EECS Upper Div 5/5
* DS Minor - Ethics Course

The upper divs I was planning to take were:

* CS 189 in Spring (heard its better)
* CS 184
* CS 170
* CS 162
* EECS 126 or 127
* Possibly INFO 159

Open to other suggestions, I want to pursue a masters but am open to going into industry. Worried if grade will tank from pushing all these classes in one"

"Let's be clear: Harris did not lose because of ""the woke""",https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gptsij/lets_be_clear_harris_did_not_lose_because_of_the/,3,89,2024-11-12 19:56:10,"Other than the obvious, what's been bothering me over the last few days is the assumption that Kamala Harris lost the election because she was ""too woke"" or because the left is ""too woke"". ""Wokeness"", or at least the popular conception of it, is almost entirely defined by right-wing spaces that cherry-pick videos or media of people they deem to be unreasonable. 

In reality, Harris ran an extremely ""un-woke"" campaign. She almost never mentioned her heritage or her gender, she never talked about representation, nor did she ever mention the fact that she would've been the first female president or that she would've broken the glass ceiling. She mostly talked about vague economic policies, ""turning the page"" on Trump, and ""moving forward"". Her campaign message was basically, ""aren't you sick of this guy?"". A great campaign to have run in 2020, but after four years of post-pandemic inflation, Americans, like everyone else in the world, were primed to despise their incumbent party, regardless of political affiliation.

  
Remember, a whole bunch of Americans didn't even realize that Biden had dropped out. Do you really think that they cared about minute identity politics and defeating ""the woke""? They care about putting food on the table. They care about the price of gas and eggs. They care about their stagnant wages. All of those things have a common denominator, and let me give you a hint: it's not immigrants. It's corporations and neoliberal politics stretching back to the Reagan era. But dems are too spineless to run on anything real and are therefore the party of the status quo. Right now, there is nothing worse than the status quo. 

We do need to turn the page, but not on the country, on the party. The democrats need populism. They need a real message and real policies with material improvements for working class Americans. They need to EARN peoples' votes. 

The republicans' economic plans will likely throw this country into a deep recession, which will turn uninformed voters against them. That gives progressives a clear opportunity to counter-attack and actually help people with policies that improve their conditions. Remember, it's not ""the woke"". It's the economy. Always has been."

Questions from a prospective international student,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1go8ijn/questions_from_a_prospective_international_student/,1,3,2024-11-10 19:22:34,"Hi everyone, I am a high school senior from Turkey doing the IB Diploma Programme and the Turkish High School Curriculum. I am considering applying to UC Berkeley and have a couple of questions in mind, if you can help me with them I would greatly appreciate it.

  
**1. When applying, is it safer to use IB predicted grades or my GPA?**

My school predicted me a 44/45 and my gpa is around 96-97 for the four years. Since the predicted is not a solid score, I feel like it might be a bit risky to use in my application but it might also make me stand out so I am not sure which path to take. What do you think?

  
**2. Are there any databases for external scholarships for international students?**

As I saw on the website, there are almost no scholarships (except for the 2k merit scholarship) and I need support from a scholarship/financial aid to go to Berkeley. Does anyone know any databases for international scholarships for Berkeley? If you got an external scholarship, could you share your application process and stats? 

Overall, applying to the UC's raises a couple of question marks as I believe none of them offer scholarships/financial aid for internationals (except UCI). Can you guys share your experiences as international students at UC Berkeley? Thanks."

Also, some first questions:

1. How does housing in Berkeley work like? I suppose student dorms, co-living, fraternities and sororities. What do you deem to be a good idea to be affordable but still close to the campus experience? Currently, thinking about applying to the I House, but not sure as it's rather expensive.
2. Some stuff I should absolutely do when in the Bay Area? Football games, SF Visit, Golden Gate Bridge, etc..?
3. How does access to the sports and food amenities work? Do you get a sort of UCB matriculation card where you get access with?
4. Which places should I avoid during day and night time? Heard Oakland and Berkeley can have a rather big amount of unwanted homeless people walking around.
5. The typical reputation back here in Germany about US schools is that you have pretty crazy student parties. I would ofc try to take some of that experience with me when I'll be heading back home. Any recommendations on where to go out at night? Do faculties and students organize a lot of stuff?

To the White students who didn't vote for Trump,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1go70x6/to_the_white_students_who_didnt_vote_for_trump/,0,168,2024-11-10 18:18:56,"(respectfully) no TL;DR, not accommodating for short attention spans. That's what got us in this mess in the first place.

I'm male, African American, a senior double majoring in the social sciences, and I'm fifty-five years old (never too late to get that degree). I didn't vote for Trump (shocker).

In a conversation with one of our academic senators we discussed the election. I said to him that my main concern is that I feel angry and I don't know who my friends are. I love this school, I love the challenge,, and I love the person that it is shaping me to be. Similarly I have as much affection for all the students here and before last week felt that we were all one big golden bear family, but I'm not so sure if that's the case anymore?

While I am heartened that white people ages 18 to 35 came out in mass against fascism, racism, and an attack on democracy, many in that age group still did, (not to mention the older people in the White demographic). In my mind if 50% of the country voted for Trump, that essentially means that every other white student that I see either voted for fascism or knew someone who did. This is fucking heartbreaking for me.

As an older Golden Bear, I grew up in a time when educators filled our heads with this audacious idea that all you had to do was do right by yourself and others, and at some point the social dynamic would bring us all together. It would not be a society in perfect harmony, but not friggin divided through the middle like now. Part of me feels stupid and naive for believing that, but this is not a therapy session so moving on.

For many of us the message that the result of the election shouted was, fuck you Blacks! If you thought that there were any bonds between us, let us make it clear, fuck you. And after hearing a message like that, I don't know many Blacks or minorities that have any desire to engage. My father was white so this is doubly painful for me.

But I know...  no, I want to believe that there are White people who  believe in the same things we do and are probably as pissed and confused as we are, I think?

So, I'm not asking low-key, I'm asking high key, where are my white brothers and sisters at who stood with us? Lately the disheartening part of my days is trying to figure out wheather the smiling frat guy walking by is greeting me or gloating.

I want to at some point talk to you guys, but I can't figure out where you are. So I hope I get a chance to meet chill and just have conversations with you guys. I know it's intuitive for a lot of us in marginalized communities to want to isolate ourselves, but I want to friggin do something! So comment and/or message. Maybe if I'm lucky I'll make some new friends, and find camaraderie amongst kindred spirits. So for now , it's the best idea I got because it's going to be a rough four years."

My problem lies in that econ 100a completely filled up before my enrollment time, and I got the other three classes that I wanted, but I need a micro econ class, My only other option would be to enroll in econ 101a(Math intensive microeconomics). I looked at the amount of students enrolled in both and there are 82 spots left in econ 101a, and 496 spots lefy in math 54.I feel like I should drop math 54 in order to enroll in econ 101a to ensure my spot in the class however I am not sure if I will be able to get back into math 54 by phase 2 of enrollment because more freshman and other majors will be looking to take the class.

Doing research has made me feel like I don't belong here...,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gmctn9/doing_research_has_made_me_feel_like_i_dont/,351,77,2024-11-08 07:05:17,"Hey everyone, I just have to get this off my chest. I‚Äôm a senior, and I‚Äôve been working in this lab for around a year now, but recently I got some unexpected news: my PI wants me to continue on as a PhD student under him. It‚Äôs the kind of thing that people dream about for years, right? Getting picked by a top researcher to lead your own projects? But the more I think about it, the more it feels like a joke, and I‚Äôm the punchline.

I didn‚Äôt exactly come into this program with a prestigious background. Before I transferred to Berkeley as a junior, I worked at my family‚Äôs noodle shop, spent most of my free time trying to make ends meet, and only started doing research in my junior year after transferring from community college. The fact that I‚Äôm even here feels like a fluke sometimes. I barely knew what a pipette was when I first started, and now I‚Äôm supposed to be leading cutting-edge research? How did I go from being just another student trying to figure out the basics to being given this major responsibility?

What really hurts is how this news has affected my relationship with my 5 other lab mates, who all got admitted as freshmen and have been working the lab much longer than I have. They have multiple publications, presented at major conferences, done internships at prestigious FAANG companies, and they all generally have their lives together. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm just sitting here hoping I don‚Äôt spill my coffee on the lab notebook or accidentally blow up the centrifuge. Every time I ask a question, it feels like I‚Äôm interrupting their flow. I feel like the awkward outsider who was accidentally allowed to stay after the tour. Somehow the news is out that I got selected to do the PhD. and they didn't, and they all seem to resent me for it. One of them even told me that I ""don't really belong here"", and I makes me just want to throw away everything I've worked for and all the opportunities I've been given and leave the lab. 

Up until now, I've tried my best to keep my head down, do my lab work, and try to learn something along the way. I‚Äôve been given this huge responsibility, but it feels like no one actually thinks I‚Äôm up to the task. The Professor keeps talking about how he sees potential in me, but honestly, I have no idea what that potential is. He‚Äôs so calm and wise, like he‚Äôs always ten steps ahead of everyone else, and I‚Äôm just scrambling to keep up. He‚Äôs been here forever, while I‚Äôm just this... noodle shop kid with no real training. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs just waiting for me to prove that I belong, but it feels like I‚Äôm the only one who hasn‚Äôt figured it out yet.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on my Postdoc advisor. He‚Äôs been tough, but fair, I guess. He doesn‚Äôt give a lot of praise, but when he does, it‚Äôs always about how I need to step up. I've noticed that he tends to play favorites  with the other undergrads, and now that he found out that I got selected for the PhD, he expects me to have become an expert overnight, while simultaneously telling me I'm not cut out for the job or how ""its not my destiny""...

I don‚Äôt feel ready. I don‚Äôt feel qualified. I‚Äôm just waiting for the moment when someone realizes I‚Äôm not the right person for the job. It feels like I just dropped into this situation as some kind of cosmic accident. When I talked to the Professor about how I feel, he simply smiled and told me that ""there are no accidents"". I know it‚Äôs an honor, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs mine to take.

So now, I‚Äôm stuck here, doing my best to convince everyone (and myself) that I actually belong in this lab. I don‚Äôt want to be the one who lets everyone down, but every time I look at my peers, I feel like they‚Äôre so much more prepared than I am. They have their lives together. I have this huge project to manage, some advanced genome sequencer called *DRGN warRIOR*, and no idea how I'm supposed to be qualified enough to fulfill this destiny I have been given.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready, but I also don‚Äôt know how to get ready. Some days it feels like I‚Äôm just playing pretend.

Is Berkeley good for premed/ Is Berkeley a good public university?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gnorfb/is_berkeley_good_for_premed_is_berkeley_a_good/,0,8,2024-11-10 00:56:49,"Please delete if not allowed

I've been interested in UC Berkeley for several years, specifically for pre-med. I'd like to know if the people going to Berkeley like it there. I really want to eventually go on to med school to become a neurosurgeon, and I looked into Berkeley and it seemed like it is a really good public uni for pre med.

Obviously Johns Hopkins is a no-brainer for future medical careers, but in order to have my tuition paid for (my mom is a veteran), I have to go to a public university.

I also want to know if the people, specifically the  ones studying something like biology or chemistry, that attend Berkeley actually like being there. Do you think it was a good selection for your major/career focus or do you wish you went somewhere else? 

I'd really love some feedback, any advice would greatly be appreciated! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Secondly, if it was ever funny it certainly no longer is. Maybe it could be a good pro-social tune if you travel to new areas a lot, but in the same community it becomes less a quirk and more a frustration. 

If the honker is reading this, I'd ask you to please consider minimizing laying into the horn so much. Doing something aggressive in a cutesy way merely dresses up the aggression. If you think it's funny to annoy people or if you believe other people genuinely enjoy this repeated bit every single day, then disregard. Had to finally attempt a post though. "

Hello my peeps,

I am a nontraditional (older) student who is attending University of Tennessee at Chattanooga to finish a bachelor's(I have an associate of applied science in programming from Nashville State Community College). I was a software developer for a few years but got laid off and decided to go back to school. I am thinking to try to go into digital media/animation/game design and have interests in music, film, performance, and related disciplines, and I understand UC Berkeley has good programs and I think may be a good environment for me personally. I have tooled around with things like Unity, Godot, and Blender in the past but never really created a project.They have no such programs here at UTC so I am considering my options. I have always been a doodler and was in middle school band and but that was awhile ago and I was planning on taking some basic art and music courses in the Spring but I don't know how much of a portfolio I would need or be able to have by a certain date for Fall 2025. I skimmed the sub and it seems scary, which I totally get, but does anyone have any insight into UC Berkeley, the related programs, or the area (I've never been to California)? Your assistance in this matter will be greatly appreciated. Most humble and gracious thanks to you üôè"

Transfer student: do I need to take differential equations to fulfill math 54 for the CS major transfer requirement?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gmtjyk/transfer_student_do_i_need_to_take_differential/,3,14,2024-11-08 21:25:39,"I am a transfer student at de anza and I have read the transfer requirements on assist and at the same time I noticed a small line:

‚ÄúComputer Science does not require full equivalence to Math 54 and will accept just the Linear Algebra course of an articulated Math 54-equivalent series .‚Äù

And on Berkeley website: [https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/academics/requirements-lower-division](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/academics/requirements-lower-division)

Transfer Courses:¬† ""Linear Algebra: We accept linear algebra without differential equations from California community colleges in all cases where the course is included in¬†a Math 54 articulation agreement. Linear algebra courses from non-California community colleges may be considered by individual petition.""

Does this mean I don't need to take differential equations even though our transfer catalog lists it as a series

https://preview.redd.it/9j1kd491wqzd1.png?width=2404&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd468da8b11facef37e966b28b85fbefa7f2b05a

If so, or if not, can I take math2a and math2b separately at two different community colleges.

UCLA allows math2a and math2b to be taken at different schools, but is it a hindrance to the UCB application if this is done.

Computer Science is part of the CDSS faculty, so the transfer course math54 policy should be the same for CS and DS. Has anyone successfully transferred into CDSS this year and only taken linear algebra, even if it was in the same course series as pictured above?

\---

# BIG UPDATE

I emailed to ds adviser and cs adviser and they said they only need math2b linear algebra and can put math2a and math2b in both schools.

""For CS at UCB, we only need linear algebra without differential equations. You only need to take Math 2B from the screenshot you provided. It is fine for UCB to split the classes between two different schools.""

""In regards to the Data Science linear algebra requirement, we only require the linear algebra portion of Math 54 articulation agreements, so in your example Math 2B - Linear Algebra is all that is needed. You are welcome to take differential equations as well if you want, and from our perspective it doesn't matter where you take it at. If you do take it from two separate schools it won't articulate as Math 54 (articulations are specific and set by school), but that again is not an issue or problem from the Data Science major side of things.""

Thank everyone and the school counselor for answers and concerns, and I hope this message will help upcoming transfer students.

When you vote, you take responsibility for that vote. Anyone who voted Republican had more than enough information to know they are voting against women's rights, gay/LGBT rights, and in favor of massive tax breaks for the wealthy. You can't expect to vote that way and then respond angrily when others take that vote as you intended it. It's totally fair to hold people accountable for that vote - making a vote is making a decision, and making a vote has consequences. If you voted Republican, you voted for prejudice, racism, and misogyny. This is just the truth. If people don't want to take responsibility for that, then that's on them. Maybe they aren't those things and felt they voted for another reason - but you can't have one without the other; you can't say I want to vote for Trump just for economic policies, and not also be voting for him to send in the ICE teams to separate families, or make a nation-wide ban on access to reproductive health.

I would actually say that if Dems don't hold Republicans accountable, then they are assuming they are too stupid, homophobic, etc. to be responsible for their vote. These are m-fing adults - you, if you voted that way, you are an adult and when you ticked the box for Trump you ticked the box for hate and division. You did that. Dems didn't do that. I didn't do that. That was you, and you are responsible for that choice.

I agree that saying all these voters are stupid is wrong - most of them are 100% smart enough to know they were voting for a potential dictator and they chose to do that anyway. They sat down, thought about it - or chose not to really think about it - and made that mark. When this goes badly, they should take that responsibility and wear it.

Not to say Dems didn't fk up - can you imagine how bad at your job Biden has to be to think he should have run again? - but never, ever give the Trump voters a free pass. They knew. They know. I know that's the truth, and I hold them to it."

As there is yet much more to do and the game is not over until January. What I want to write about is how awful I feel about the way this election is won. I feel deeply ashamed, for the Democrats. This is not a post to boast or in ""in your face"" type of deal. I am genuinely embarrassed by how the election turned out for the Democrats. I feel as they got cheated.

The fact is, the DNC has been cheating the Liberal voters for years. I have heard the argument that ""America is not ready for a woman president"" and I disagree. I don't think Kamala Harris lost the election because she's a woman. I think she lost because she's Kamala Harris. I was talking to a friend who's mother runs a Democrat campaign on a major swing state on the east coast as a state officer( official staff). she told me that many registered Democrats did not show up to vote and when asked why, they explain that they were hesitant to vote since Harris was not voted on during the democratic primaries this year.

If the DNC had simply stopped lying to their voters from the beginning(about Joe's health and wellness) and promoted someone respectable and likable ( such as Tulsi Gabbard - Hawaii Senator, minority women, military service, extremely intelligent and charismatic) and have her run through the DNC primary, Trump would not have stood a chance.

However, Tulsi Gabbard was not chosen to run with the DNC, just like what happened to Bernie Sanders in 2016. You know why? It is because these candidates people like are unwilling to play nice with the Democratic elites and their corporate donors. So they get taken down and people like Harris or Clinton get pushed into the spot light, and people dislike these candidates so much they would rather not vote or vote for a obviously flawed candidate like Donald Trump ( I voted for Trump but he is obviously flawed, and still got elected. What does that tell you?).

Stop voting on identity politics, stop lying to your constituents. Select a candidate because they are likable and have good policies, not because they can check off more boxes on a FAFSA form.

Here is a link to The Young Turks on why DNC keeps losing:

Edit: I am doing this to help people. I don't want to have this happen again because if you keep playing this game and Trump keeping winning the game it becomes boring. Please don't make this game boring! I want to next election to be exciting with an actually good Democratic candidate and good campaign strategies. Please! "

Rant: Why are Upper Division Econ Classes so terrible?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1gjyv67/rant_why_are_upper_division_econ_classes_so/,43,17,2024-11-05 04:44:38,"Note: I have not taken every single upper-division economics class, and do not doubt that there are great classes among the rough. However, I am mostly referring to the required classes (Econ 100/101 series (except 100a, love Campbell) and Econ 140/141 series, alongside other more theoretical-based econ classes)

It's so strange to me knowing that Berkeley is simultaneously one of, if not THE top-ranked school for economics, and yet nearly all of the upper-division classes are taught horribly. I've talked to other people taking these classes, and I think this generally seems to be a common sentiment. I think the biggest issues I have with these classes are the following ones:

1. Completely confusing course material. I've taken difficult classes in other departments like CS/DS and Stats, but nothing comes close to the level of carelessness I've seen from econ classes. It's hard enough that they barely release any practice exams, if at all (and often without answer keys making them practically useless without OH), but the kicker is half these classes don't even bother to create decent SLIDES. I've taken multiple classes (Econ 155, Econ 144 etc) that release nearly empty slidedecks, with most of the content consisting of really scattered and unclear pieces of information. Even when these classes *do* create slides, they are often just mostly consistent of random statements, formulas, and proofs without any sort of context or explanation written. If you miss a class and don't have a friend's notes? You better pray the GSI, who's probably as confused as you are, knows how to help you in Office Hours. 


2.  Lack of communication between course staff. It is such a surreal experience going into office hours, trying to find the answer to a practice question without an answer key, and finding the GSI to be as stumped as you are. I do not blame the GSI's (for the most part) for this: from what I have heard, this is often because GSIs are often not even given an answer key from the prof, and have to create one themselves. Not only does this lead to a lack of support, but it ultimately makes grading on homework a complete dice roll as to whether you got ""the nice GSI"" or not. It also has led to feeling a significant disconnect between discussions and lectures, with course material being taught in different ways in both domains. 


3. Unbearably boring lectures. I think this is probably the most subjective out of my points here, and I totally get if people find these lectures fascinating, but holy hell. While I am sure the lecturers do fantastic research and love their field very much, their passion does NOT come across during lectures. Whether it is highlighting random formulas without any indication of their practical application or purpose, writing down absurdly long proofs that aren't even going to be tested on, or just the monotonous tone that turns the lecture into white noise, I cannot stand them. It's no wonder the lecture halls for my econ classes all turn to barren wastelands halfway into the semester. I don't believe this is an issue exclusive to the econ department, but it is especially pervasive here.


I'm sure everyone has their own stories with these classes, so feel free to share. The saving grace to many of these classes is that they aren't that hard to get a decent grade in, but that's mostly because everyone is as confused as you are. There are definitely good classes in the major like 100a, but the bad massively outweighs the good IMO. Rant over."

I was doing fine the first half of the semester, but now the classic impacting-sleep-and-work is starting to show up again.

Everyone passed him over as joke, clown, and a celebrity stunt. Lost in 2020, cared so much about winning couldn't accept it. In the end, it helped him to not accept defeat allowing him to win again in the next term. Essentially allowing him to have a run of 8 years of being one of the most followed, influential person. And the only president since 1900s to pull off return to White House after losing as incumbent. Like him or hate him, he's mastered life and knows how to win and get what he wants. Not easy to become a multi billionaire and pull off stuff like this as a non politician and someone never seen in a serious light. A man of unconventional paths, that loves to work and figures his way out and goes after what he wants and gets it. Surely everyone can find it inspiring in some light. "

Plenty of Trump supporters love our country and its people. Everyone does it differently. It can be hard to see the love amidst the hateful campaign ads and speeches, tactics, and tense climate.

But it‚Äôs there, and it‚Äôs strong.

If we all focus on that simple truth, regardless of our affiliations, then our government will represent our collective heart.

So fuck the results, let‚Äôs be the best we can be for our nation and beyond.

EDIT: I‚Äôm not surprised many of you are scared, feeling unloved, and angry. It‚Äôs a challenging time to be an American, no matter what side you‚Äôre on. When you‚Äôre ready, look deep into your opponent. Almost always, you will find that they love, just differently than you. That‚Äôs the nature of life. Love that too.

EDIT: If you or your loved ones are part of the non-white Christian group, I know it sounds crazy to say that a Trump supporter may love you, and vice versa. In most cases that‚Äôs only because neither has tried to bridge the gap. If you try, you will see another beautiful person on the other side of the aisle.

I didn't get into CS for the money, I genuinely wanted to major in Computer Science after my exposure to programming in HS. Now I'm wondering if maybe this isn't right for me? Like, I really don't want to do projects in my free time. I don't actually enjoy how abstract CS is. I want to go into a field that affects people in a more tangible sense. Yes, I understand that CS is incredibly impactful, but the impersonal nature of the work leaves me feeling unfulfilled.

I would've wanted to do medicine, but the 10-14+ years of schooling is so daunting. Still, I have a lot more excitement, drive and energy when thinking about medicine than I have had for CS in a long, long time.

How do professors generally feel about students who turn things around?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1giscdd/how_do_professors_generally_feel_about_students/,30,12,2024-11-03 17:35:16,"I'm in a class where I have honestly not been doing great. Believe it or not, I enjoy the class content and I like my professor, but for some reason I can barely find motivation to work hard this year. I just failed an exam in the class horribly because I didn't study nearly as hard as I should have, and I wasn't as transparent and upfront with my professor as I should have been about it either when they wanted to know why. I have also been delaying submitting assignments, and I feel like my professor has an overall negative image of me as a student now.

I really want to turn this around by the end of the semester if possible. I'm going to do my very best moving forward, showing up to office hours frequently, getting all my homework in on time, studying my ass off to do well on the next exam, etc, but I want to know if this would help at all with fixing my image of myself in front of my professor, or if I have permanently fucked up. This is an important class for my major and I wanted to build a good relationship with my professor, but I'm worried there's no going back now. I take full responsibility for all of this and I know it's entirely on me, and obviously it would have been better if I was just consistently good and hardworking from the start.

But is it likely that it could leave a good lasting impression on the professor if I clearly work hard to turn things around and do better for the rest of the semester, even if I started on the wrong foot? Or will the professor still most likely think of me as just an apathetic student who dodges responsibility and doesn't care about their class? I'm so worried and I have so many regrets about how I have handled everything so far, and I feel so bad. I‚Äôm very concerned I have permanently ruined our relationship, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs even worth trying so hard to do better moving forward if this current impression of me probably won‚Äôt change much."

Thoughts on Proposition 33?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ghpvc4/thoughts_on_proposition_33/,0,7,2024-11-02 05:47:18,"Trying my best to be an informed voter and I'm searching for arguments for and against Prop 33. I understand Prop 33 will only repeal the Costa-Hawkins Act which [sets limits](https://caanet.org/topics/costa-hawkins-act/) on rent control. When I mention ""increased rent control,"" it's under the assumption a number of cities already have laws on the books that without Costa-Hawkins preemption, would cover more units; or would pass new rent control laws.

**Con:** Proponents of rent control will contend that moderate rent control policies can mitigate unintended impacts such as landlords selling the rental properties to become condos, or regulations allowing maintenance costs to be passed down to tenants (incentivizing them to take better care of their properties) could alleviate the concern that housing stock quality would go down under expanded rent control. But a yes vote provides no guarantee cities will pass sensible rent control.

**Con:** Overall, I think it's easy to convince oneself of the argument that increased rent control will curtail new development as developers would face lower profits, and thus worsening the root cause of high rents: a shortage of housing in California. **Pro:** In a KQED [podcast](https://www.kqed.org/news/12007197/transcript-proposition-33-would-end-state-limits-on-rent-control) on the issue, they had an economist on air bring up an interesting point: economists as an academic community have a bias against government intervention, and this can be seen in their general opposition to minimum wage laws‚Äîbut we haven't seen the job losses that were feared when municipalities or states pass higher minimum wages. **""Pro"":** Cities couldn't pass ludicrous rent control laws that would stop all new construction, as California courts [have ruled](https://calmatters.org/housing/2024/10/prop-33-2024-fact-check/) developers must be able to earn ""a just and reasonable return on their property.""

**Pro:** Also mentioned in the podcast is the fact that homeowners benefit from a form of price control in the form of federally subsidized fixed-rate 30-year mortgages, and so a similar protection should be extended to renters.

**Con:** Some contend rent control is too broad of a brush to use if the goal is to reduce displacement. While rents in rent controlled units would go down or stay the same, not all those living in rent controlled units would've been at risk of displacement anyways. Conversely, people at risk of displacement will still end up living in non-rent controlled units through no fault of their own. This begs the question, why can't we just give money to people at risk of displacement instead of using the bludgeon of rent control if our goal is to reduce homelessness? It seems like the trolley problem, where people have better feelings towards rent control than giving away more housing vouchers, even if they're means-tested.

**Personal Experience:** Although I mentioned I live in an ostensibly rent-controlled building, I'm still embittered at being a renter, paying $4300/3 bedrooms (3 people total). Based on a selling price of \~$900,000 for the duplex, the average mortgage rate when the home was sold in 2014, and a down payment of 20%, our monthly rate is still twice my relatively small landlord's monthly mortgage payment for our ""half"" of the selling price. Let's be generous and assume property taxes and home insurance take up the rest. That means my rent payment is generating equity for my landlord into a property now worth an estimated $1,300,000 *at no cost to him*. After I move out, and whenever he sells, I won't see a dime of that sale price. The insult to injury is how many material improvements I've made to the property as a tenant out of necessity (replacing window weatherstripping, sealing gaps in outlet boxes and baseboards), because this shitbox has no insulation in the walls and costs more to heat in the winter than my parent's house in New York State.

**My takeaways:** Renting sucks, there is a severe housing shortage not just in California, but the entire country, and it doesn't seem clear on how to fix it. I'm still undecided after writing this. Part of me wants to vote yes to give the opportunity to cities to pass thoughtful rent control legislation; part of me wants to vote no to keep the gravy train rolling for national developers building giant boxes in Berkeley that my fellow students will dearly overpay for, putting less pressure on the housing stock I live in.

Stayed in my room and started working on a presentation. Then went for breakfast and going to class. Got ladle stuff, and went home early. No GDD meeting. I saw a bunch of costumes in MLK before going to class. A bunch of sugar and some shirts that I drew on. I wish I could do more at halloween. 

Afterwards, I was full, but still ate dinner. Went to a performance(and saw some poeple I knew)(I probably went to the wrong event). The performance is about our time here, and who will be remembered and are we all actors of a stage of the leaders. I think the takeaway was that people should be able to not stay in the present. That concept doesn't really exist. 

I was spoken French out, and did a jesus cross move, but nothing else happened to me."
