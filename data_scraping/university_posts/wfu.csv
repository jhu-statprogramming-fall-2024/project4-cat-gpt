How should I report this silent discrimination experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/wfu/comments/1fa1piq/how_should_i_report_this_silent_discrimination/,0,32,2024-09-06 00:12:37,"Hey everyone, I wanted to get your thoughts on something that happened recently. I'm an Asian female international student at WFU, and in one of my classes, I usually sit next to a white American girl. At first, everything seemed fine, but recently the vibe has changed, and I can feel her being dismissive towards me. I know my spoken English isn't at a native level, but my communication is clear and I’ve had no issues connecting with other American students.

What makes me uncomfortable is that during class discussions, she often stays silent or gives me this dismissive look whenever I try to engage in conversation. It's like she's intentionally shutting me down. This week, she even went as far as moving to sit with a group of American students during discussion time, completely avoiding me. To me, this feels like silent discrimination against international students — no outright words, but her actions spoke loudly, showing no consideration for how it might affect me.

I don't believe I deserve to be treated with this level of disrespect just because I’m an international student. It’s upsetting because I thought WFU, a university that prides itself on equality, diversity, and respect, would foster a more inclusive environment.

I’m also worried that if this continues unchecked, other international students might experience similar treatment. Do you think I should report this to the school or a relevant department? I don't want others to go through what I’m experiencing. Would appreciate any advice.

Update: And can people stop twisting the issue? Does someone have to be liked in order to be treated decently? What kind of twisted logic is that? I don't like this girl, but I would never treat her the way she treats me—completely ignoring a classmate sitting right next to her. Stop trying to pin things on me with false accusations."

I want to attend Wake Forest, but I have some questions and concerns that I cannot find answers to online. It would be awesome if someone could answer them for me. Thanks!

1. I heard that Wake Forest is very hard academically and there is a lot of grade deflation. I currently have a 4.5 weighted GPA in high school, but I saw that the average freshman GPA at Wake Forest is 2.9 out of 4. This seems to be very low, and I feel like if I attend Wake Forest and get a low GPA, it will significantly hurt my chances of getting into a law school. Is it true that Wake Forest is extremely difficult, and many people receive low grades?
2. I plan on applying to law school after undergrad. In terms of law school admission, does graduating from Wake Forest undergrad heighten my chances of getting admission to Wake Forest Law? I have read mixed reports on how going to undergrad at the same institution affects your chances of getting into the same school for grad school.

Wake Forest University or William and Mary???,https://www.reddit.com/r/wfu/comments/16rvvqg/wake_forest_university_or_william_and_mary/,9,17,2023-09-25 15:55:13,"I am torn between applying ED to William and Mary or Wake Forest University. Both are good match schools for me (according to my guidance counselor). I like what I hear about the welcoming and friendly student body at WM but have been a bit turned off by the reports of bad housing, poor dining facilities and food, construction that will go on for most of my time there, lack of on and off campus housing for upperclassmen, and the growing class sizes. I know WM provides a world-class education but am just worried about quality of life while there. Wake Forest has amazing facilities, dorms and dining options, small class sizes, guaranteed on-campus housing for at least 3 years with options for a fourth, a ton of quality, close-by ,off-campus housing for seniors if that path is chosen, and a culture where the professors know you well. However, I cannot get a great read on the what the student body might be like. I have read reviews that say the student body is cliquey and it can seem like high school 2.0 and others have said it is a student body made up of really smart engaged students who like to work hard but also have a lot of fun to create balance. I would appreciate any feedback from anyone who has knowledge/experience with either or both of these schools. Do I sacrifice quality of life for a great student body at William and Mary or go in to the unknown as far as the student body goes at Wake Forest knowing that the campus, facilities, housing, food, and systems are top tier? To note, I am OOS for WM and Wake Forest is a private school. I will not be eligible for any financial aid. Major is undecided but possibly bio or chemistry--but most likely not pre-med. I would most likely try to join Greek life at either campus."

Look no further than the NZCFL, an 120-team college football simulation league, where many teams, including Wake Forest, are open! Our league offers a unique combination of a realistic coaching and recruiting experience, with the flexibility that allows you to put in as much or as little time as you wish! Our recruiting system, designed to emulate the real-life football recruiting process and comprised of three sections, allows you to sign a program-changing class in just one cycle. If you’re looking for that more casual experience, it’s easy to get the process knocked out in one sitting, but you’ll still be able to go even farther if you’re able to put the time in. That’s what makes this league such a great experience - you’re in control. You have the ability to build a legacy and leave a lasting impact on these teams.

As someone who's been in the league for nearly two IRL years, it really is a great community. Everyone is willing to lend a hand to a newbie, the mods put a ton of time into running things smoothly, and there's plenty of casual activities and banter to keep things interesting. 

Come join us by claiming a team in the Reddit reservation thread at r/NZCFL and joining the server![ https://discord.gg/vJnYPFd](https://discord.gg/vJnYPFd) If you have any questions, DM me, or join the server and ask in ⁠newcomers. We'll be happy to help."

Best bar to watch Wake Forest football games? Why is it the best watch party bar?

Best postgame bar after Wake Forest football games? Why is it the best post game bar?

Any information is extremely helpful and appreciated. I can’t wait to see some of the responses.

BU has a better environment in my opinion. College town, diverse student body, bigger school which I think I'd like, and easy to switch majors

My biggest con are the grade deflation rumors that I've heard

**WFU:** perhaps a better business program, open-curriculum, better campus, small class sizes which may make class quality better

cons: no diversity (predominantly white), location is meh not much to go and see

As a conservative leaning person, is Wake Forest a place where I can talk openly about politics. It seems to from what I’ve read but there doesn’t seem to be a better place than here to ask. At my high school, I have right-wing and left-wing friends and none of us dislike each other for it (we are friends after all). I’ve talked to people who go to schools like Georgia Tech and Northwestern. They both said they have to pretend to be liberals or else they’d lose all their friends. I am also worried about the teachers being extremely biased. I am okay with both teachers and students being liberal but I want to learn from unbiased lessons and not be shunned by my peers. 

To sum up this post, is Wake Forest University a place where I would have to worry about my political beliefs?

One thing I can't find is whether or not Wake Forest has accepted nontraditional students. From my research, it appears that some colleges look for older students to add diversity to their campus, but other colleges find that nontrads would not be a good fit for their student body, accepting virtually zero. If there are no nontraditional students at WFU, I don't think it would be worth my time to heavily research the school and write essays.

""We will start the semester with all of us, regardless of vaccination status, wearing a mask indoors, with exceptions that are defined below. We anticipate this will be a temporary measure to allow for a smooth transition back to the classroom and campus environment. We will evaluate this decision weekly and make adjustments accordingly. Beginning Monday, August 16, masks are required indoors except while actively eating and drinking and with the following exceptions:

Students who provided proof of vaccination may remove masks when in residence halls. 

Note: Due to the presence of families with unknown vaccination status in the residence halls, we encourage our students to wear masks during hours that the building is open to visitors for move-in.

Anyone alone in a private office may remove their mask. 

Faculty and staff who have provided proof of vaccination may continue to remove masks in private shared workspaces. 

Note: Private shared workspaces above refers to areas where a supervisor is aware that all colleagues occupying the work space have been approved by Human Resources to be unmasked. Examples of a private shared workspace include small conference rooms, research labs and offices shared by two or more people reporting to the same supervisor.

Masks are required in all classrooms.  

Note: Faculty who provided proof of vaccination may opt to remove their masks when teaching or presenting if they are able to remain at least 10 feet from the audience. Classrooms will not be set up or assigned to accommodate any further distancing from the presenter than currently exists in the assigned space. The Provost’s Office will provide further information about classroom guidelines.

Students who received a medical or religious exemption will remain masked in all indoor settings except when in their personal residence hall room. 

All visitors to campus will continue to wear masks indoors until further notice. 

Masks are not required for anyone in outdoor settings."""

Last week, we paused the implementation of the renaming of Wingate Hall to become May 7, 1860 Hall. This proposed change generated a critical and difficult conversation among our students, faculty, staff and alumni. I have listened and heard the need for further discussions about the intent behind our decision and the impact such a name has on our community members. I am sorry for the pain this has caused many Black students, colleagues and alumni. We are committed to understanding our community’s reactions to the renaming of Wingate Hall, and as such, I reported that Trustee Donna Edwards (’80) and Vice President José Villalba agreed to chair an advisory team focused on both clarifying our intentions and the process for finding a new name.

Today, I am pleased to share the names of the advisory committee members and to reiterate the committee’s charge. The advisory committee is intentionally a small group representing major stakeholders who have voiced concerns or questions about the proposed new name and process to date. The small size of this group will be essential given the relatively short time frame they have to accomplish the charge: (a) to clarify the objectives in selecting a name for the former Wingate Hall, and (b) to collect and understand our community’s concerns, reactions and suggestions regarding a new name.

The Advisory Committee includes:

Kelly Starnes (’93, MBA ’14)
President, Association of Wake Forest University Black Alumni

Alex Reyes Schroeder (’06, JD ’09) 
President, Wake Forest Alumni Association

Erica Still 
Associate Professor
Associate Dean for Faculty Recruitment, Diversity and Inclusion
Co-Chair, President’s Commission on Race, Equity and Community

Jacob Thomas (’22) 
President, Black Student Alliance

Ally Swartzberg (’22) 
President, Student Government

Tim Pyatt
Dean of the ZSR Library
Co-Chair, Slavery, Race and Memory Project

Roommate situation,https://www.reddit.com/r/wfu/comments/nbj97j/roommate_situation/,12,3,2021-05-13 15:27:28,I’m going to wake next year (class of ‘25) and I was wondering about the roommate situation. Is it entirely randomized? Like you can’t chose your roommate? I’m not from NC and I don’t know anyone coming in my year so I wouldn’t necessarily have someone to choose as my roommate I’m just wondering how the process works. I’d love to hear what you guys thought about your freshman roommates and if it worked out well. Thanks :)

It seems like the perfect school for me although the only thing I’m worried about is how hard the academics are (it sounds like). I’ve talked to a few family friends who attended but wanted to get another opinion. I know the classes are small and professors are super accessible and wake doesn’t accept students who won’t succeed- but I’m still worried about the difficulty. For reference, I’m a decently bright kid but I’m not a total book worm. I love sports and going outside and stuff. I DEFINITELY don’t want my college experience to be spent in the library 100% of the time. I get that college is hard but I really want to have time and energy to spend on other activities- not constantly stressing over grades or doing homework all day. I want to be more well rounded and have a better balance. I was just wondering how students typically find the academics and How possible is this sort of balance at WFU? Thank you guys!"

I got admitted into Wake (class of 2025) and I am currently making a decision between it and another school. My other school option is an incredibly liberal environment with an incredible amount of acceptance and love for the LGBTQ+ community, and although I am personally not the most transparent and open about my sexuality, it definitely is a big part of who I am. That being said, after reading a good chunk of posts on this sub and visiting \~2 years ago, it seems that Wake's absolutely more conservative than my other option, and I was just wondering what it's like living as an open student there. I've read the emails I've received from the LGBTQ+ center and will attend the session later this month, but I just want to hear from some students what it's like.

I've been accepted to Wake Forest and am really excited to go there, but before that I want to make a deep research on various aspects that are important to me since I've been accepted to some other universities as well.

I'm a recent immigrant from Eastern Europe and although I picked up English in these 3 years I've been living in the US, I am still conscious about my accent and pronunciation. It is easier for me to talk to people who are or have ties to international students/immigrants on psychological level for these reasons, I suppose. Knowing that Wake Forest isn't a huge school I am curious on the amount of non-native English speakers (immigrants/international students). And also I think meeting people from backgrounds different from what I've experienced is very interesting and educational at the same time."

Hey y’all - please bear with the long winded story lmao - i’m considering wake class of 25, have one concern that eats me up a bit. tl;dr of my personal history is that i have a rough history with drugs and partying and near death (i’m sober and healthy and honestly doing pretty good rn) and the partying scene makes me incredibly anxious. i’m aware fraternities aren’t all like this or big evil bullying groups or even that bad or anything, I just don’t like being in massive groups of drunk people or bright lights or loud music one bit anymore. 

that said i wanna have like a normal college experience. im not a shelled up introvert, i’m just kinda a weird nerd. i don’t mind the concept of drinking games with close friends or getting high on a weekend, i just don’t want to go back to what my life was like when i was spiraling. is it possible to toe that middle ground at a school that’s so dominated by greek life? anyone weighing in on their experiences would be hugely meaningful to me as i make the decision. go deacs :D"

I don’t expect everyone to want to go to every game like me but I want to know what the culture is like. Do most students really just go to the football tailgates and then leave without even stepping in the stadium? Is there a big student section? Do kids go to basketball games? How many students go to football and basketball games? I know the energy around sports isn’t as much as most big time schools or even like Boston College, but I was just wondering what your experience has been like and if sports could easily be a big part of my experience at Wake- or would I be on my own with these interests.

These questions are probably more relevant to Wake in 2019 as opposed to the COVID era, but I'd love to hear your perspective. Thanks!

&#x200B;

1. What are freshman dorms like (best and worst dorms)? Is there a lot of dorm camaraderie, and do people tend to form friend groups with their dorms?
2. What does the psych major look like? Do psych students tend to be as stressed as pre-med students (bio, chem, physics, engineering)?
3. Is there a huge divide between students in Greek life and students in regular dorms? What do parties look like for non-Greek kids?
4. How common are small, discussion-based classes? Are most of your classes large as a freshman?
5. What does social life/student life look like at Wake? Are there any weekly traditions that everyone tends to love? Do dorms host specific events, and what are some examples of these?
6. How is the food at Wake, and what are some of your favorite meal options?
7. What's the November-March weather situation--how cold does it get, and does the weather get depressing at any point?
8. (For anyone who graduated or is a senior) How easy was it to find a job after graduating? Do you feel prepared for the rest of your life, and is there anything you wish your high school self would have known?

I'm a student at UNC-Chapel Hill and I'm working on a consulting project for a business writing class. For our consulting project, we are working with the Office of Off-Campus Student Life and Community Partnerships to address the tensions between students living in historically marginalized/Black neighborhoods and the non-student residents in those communities. 

As part of our research, my group and I are wanting to learn about how other colleges in the area are dealing with this issue. So, to those of you at Wake Forest, have you had to take any kind of training to learn about how to be a good neighbor? Have you had to learn about marginalized neighborhoods in Winston-Salem? What is WFU doing to promote good will between students and non-student residents in these communities? Any other information you have to share on the topic would be appreciated!

“Additionally, preparation for the fall semester remains fluid as the University works to navigate student health. Today University leadership decided that all undergraduate students will have to be tested for COVID-19, and quarantine if necessary, before returning to campus. This expectation includes RAs.”

It seems that all returning students will be required to be tested for COVID-19 before we get back on campus, and if you test positive, you will have to quarantine. I’m not quite sure what else will be required, but I will edit this post when I get more information. One thing to mention is that you can get a financial waiver from the school for the cost of the test if necessary.

Edit: New email just sent out, here’s a pastebin for anyone that didn’t get it

&#x200B;

I'm writing this post to let you all know that you can now create and apply your own user flairs! We ultimately decided that having to apply flairs to every person was going to be too much effort, and this also allows users to be more creative, because your flair can be anything you want. You can include your year, major, residence hall, favorite place to eat on campus: the possibilities are endless! For anyone that hasn't edited their flair before, this is how you do it:

&#x200B;

1. Go to community options and click the dropdown window.
2. Click the edit button (it looks like a little pencil) next to ""User flair preview""
3. Select ""Sample Text""
4. Delete ""Sample Text"" and type whatever you want your flair to be in the text box.
5. Make sure the box that says ""Show my user flair on this community"" is checked and then click ""Apply""

You can change this at any time or remove it if you want. Also, we added the requirement for post flairs, so when you go to post, you will need to choose a post flair in order for your post to appear on the sub. We hope this will help categorize some of the posting and make it more clear about what type of content should be on here (although basically any type of content is encouraged).

I’m picking history as one of my humanities courses as I took IB History HL in high school but I have absolutely no idea which other course I should pick for my other humanities course, no cap.

Can any upperclassmen in this subreddit offer any insight/advice about which humanities courses to pick when you’re a bio major with no background and knowledge in any of these humanities course options?

Also, I realize that dorms for freshmen are communal-style, rather than suite-style. I read that there is only one dorm building that offers suites for freshmen.

“Dear Wake Forest community, 

Our mission to open the doors of opportunity, seek truth and cultivate a community of people of good character and mutual support has never been more important, and perhaps has never been more deeply challenged. The communities in which we live are under great stress, as we cope with the pandemic, an economic recession and painful reminders that we, as a country, have repeatedly failed to live up to our ideals.  

Wake Forest must continue to stand as a place of hope, supporting our community members, especially those most vulnerable among us. I remain ever grateful for how you have served one another and our greater community. You have shown compassion, flexibility, unwavering patience and steadfast goodwill in the face of the unknown. Your commitment as faculty, staff and students has proven that our mission is worth every effort to sustain.

Our Vision for the Fall

As previously shared, it is our intent -- and our earnest daily work -- to reopen Wake Forest’s campus with confidence this fall. We will announce our full plans for how we intend to do so by June 30. Significant planning and preparation remains before details are finalized; however, thanks to the exceptional work of multiple planning groups, I am able to share several insights into our current thinking. First, I would like to draw your attention to a new website, ourwayforward.wfu.edu, where you can follow the planning process, see updates as they become available and submit ideas to help us build a fall semester that exhibits the character and will of the Wake Forest community.

Insights into the Fall Academic Calendar

Planning teams of faculty and staff have evaluated several options for the fall calendar. This work is driven by our dual commitment to protecting the health and safety of our community and sustaining a vibrant learning and living environment. 

On-campus undergraduate courses will begin on August 26 and run through November 24. Students will return home for Thanksgiving and not return to campus until the start of the spring term. Concluding academic activity, including final exams, will be conducted remotely from November 30 to December 18. The Law School will have a slightly different schedule, beginning classes on August 17 and concluding all on-campus activity by November 24. Any other slight deviations to graduate and professional school calendars will be communicated by degree program leaders. We also anticipate forgoing a fall break this year; Reynolda Campus students and faculty will be asked to limit travel outside the local area in accordance with forthcoming guidelines to help preserve the health of our community.

Innovation in Course Design

Wake Forest is consistently ranked among the top universities for teaching because of the commitment our faculty make to providing the best learning outcomes for each student. True to form, we are determined to make this fall academic experience as dynamic and engaging as usual. We have invested in faculty development programs, and over the course of the summer, our faculty will participate in peer-to-peer learning communities to prepare and share innovative pedagogies. 

Recognizing that everyone may not be able to physically return to campus, we are preparing our course design to include face-to-face, blended and online classes. Teaching will use technology where necessary and where it enables students to engage more fully in the academic experience, depending on disciplinary and pedagogical best practices and public health guidelines.  

The fall course schedule, including updated information about course modalities, will be finalized by July 15. The Office of the University Registrar, faculty advisors or relevant graduate academic service areas will contact students to provide information about updated registration processes before this date. Undergraduate students will be able to build or adjust their fall schedules, taking into account our new, rich mix of offerings. Graduate and professional school students can expect some additional options for course access as well. Academic advisors will guide students through the process as in typical years.

Educating the Whole Person

While a strength of the Wake Forest experience is the deep connection among students and between students and faculty, we will have to learn to make these connections in new ways. Modifications to our signature undergraduate residential experience and some new approaches to our extracurricular activities will be needed to account for health and safety requirements.

Housing

The health and safety of our community remains our top priority. We are working closely with public health experts to review the possible configurations of our residential communities and to offer off-campus housing options. We expect to outline our plan for University housing by June 30, including any necessary and temporary revisions to the University’s three-year undergraduate residency requirement. The Office of Residence Life and Housing will contact new and current undergraduates soon thereafter with additional information regarding the on-campus application process and related housing options. 

Dining

We will offer a revised and flexible set of dining options, including enhanced take-away service and delivery offering, while self-serve buffet-style meals will likely not be possible. Our focus on sustainable ingredients, nutrition and performance will continue to be a mainstay of our program. We successfully managed this approach with a limited number of students in the spring and plan to scale those functions for the fall. We anticipate that all of our retail and residential dining offerings will be available to our campus community with added locations to address distancing and capacity expectations that comply with public health guidelines. The number of people allowed in the common spaces of the Pit, Benson Food Court and North Dining Hall will be managed appropriately.

Recreational Sports and Activities

We anticipate that the Wellbeing Center will be open with appropriate distancing measures and increased infection control measures to enhance safety. We expect to offer intramural sports activities which are low health risk, and we will pursue creative new options for friendly competitions among our students. We will also work with student leaders to create a robust offering of outdoor activities on and close to campus to enjoy North Carolina’s lovely fall weather. 

Lectures and Club Activities 

We expect a vibrant campus this fall with numerous ways for students and faculty to engage their minds and spirits. A planning team is devising a special schedule for the semester, using our beautiful campus as a backdrop for many outdoor events, public performances and art that work within the public health guidelines for indoor gatherings and social distancing.

Investing in the Health of the Community

Public Health

We trust that each community member will understand that measures will need to be taken to keep one another healthy. One lesson of the pandemic is that individual actions are interconnected. Our ability to sustain a viable fall semester will depend on each of us doing our part.

We will communicate the health, safety and hygiene expectations necessary to create a successful semester before students arrive on campus. We do not anticipate pre-screening COVID-19 testing of all individuals coming to campus, as national public health guidelines no longer support that as an effective strategy. We will provide education and seek your support on such practices as:
  
Wearing face coverings to limit infection and disease spread;
Maintaining social distancing to minimize infection and disease spread;
Vigilance in personal hygiene (hand hygiene, avoid touching your face and eyes, and cough/sneeze etiquette); 
Participating actively in self-reported daily symptom screening and of staying at home when you are sick or may have been exposed to COVID-19; and
Following guidelines on travel, indoor gatherings and isolation requirements.

We know that this semester is going to be different, but we believe that together we can create an engaging and fulfilling living and learning experience. We will be tracking key metrics for our community that will provide data on COVID-19 activity and use this data to inform the public health response. If all do their part, we will be able to minimize disruptions caused by COVID-19 outbreaks and keep the semester on track.

Student Physical and Mental Health Services 

Wake Forest is investing in the most effective health management technology and training to prepare for varying circumstances. Our academic medical center will provide testing strategies and protocols, care for the sick and expertise from nationally renowned epidemiologists. Faculty, staff and students will have the option to participate in clinical studies that will advance our knowledge about managing this pandemic and draw on latest research to improve community health.

Additionally, we will expand our capacity in the student health center to provide patients the broad medical support traditionally available. Mental health services available through the University Counseling Center and psychiatric services in the Student Health Service will remain accessible to those in need. 

Supporting the Demon Deacons 

Student-athletes are voluntarily training remotely and staying connected with their coaching staffs and teammates. The NCAA approved the return to campus for student athletes effective June 1. Wake Forest is moving cautiously, keeping the health of our student-athletes and coaching staffs our top priority.

On June 8, we welcomed back to campus a very small group of student-athletes who are rehabilitating from injuries so that they can access our state-of-the-art sports medicine equipment and training staff. They will be joined by another limited group later in June with additional groups returning in July, consistent with approved reentry procedures for campus.

The ACC and NCAA remain in discussions about the parameters for competitions and schedules. Updates will be forthcoming.

Our Way Forward 

As you can see, there is much to consider about how we will approach the fall semester. I encourage you to visit ourwayforward.wfu.edu to understand the ongoing planning process and to submit your insights and ideas for a successful fall.

It is my commitment that we will do the work -- with care and critical thought -- that will result in the best possible experience for our community. Thank you for supporting Wake Forest and helping us navigate these challenging circumstances. I am grateful to be working alongside you as we take these steps forward together. 

More than anything, I want to see our campus and spaces filled with life and learning. Our calling to provide opportunity and pursue knowledge for the benefit of society will go on, and we will meet the challenges of the day together, as one community, dedicated to the principles of openness, respect, honor, friendship and integrity.

Please continue to stay healthy and safe. 

With gratitude, 

Nathan O. Hatch

&#x200B;

I'm making this post to let you all know that u/efdmbo and I are new mods for this sub, and we are very excited to hopefully grow this community and connect with fellow Deacons!

&#x200B;

To start things off, there are a few flairs that already exists on this sub. They are as follows: ""Young Deac"", ""Old Deac"", ""Alumni"", and ""Deacon"". I will be stickying this thread so that when new people (or current members) join the sub, they can ask for a flair to indicate whether they are upcoming, current, or former Deacons. In addition to having people assign their flairs, we are open to suggestions for other flairs as well.

&#x200B;

As regulars on the sub may have noticed, this sub isn't nearly as active as other college related subs, and we would like that to change. Wake is a small school, but I would love to see this community grow, and it has been over time. One thought I have as of now is to try to recruit some people from ogboards, since that is still a very active community, and hopefully we could bring some of that traffic here. If anyone else has thoughts on how to expand our community, please let us know in the comments.

&#x200B;

Finally, we are both new to moderating, so if you have any general suggestions or improvements you would like to see made to this sub, feel free to let us know. Other than that, comment your preferred username flair in the comments, and Go Deacs!

&#x200B;

edit: u/efdmbo and I have just changed the banner, background pattern, and general color scheme of the sub."

I got an email notification today (since they recently finished sorting that out for c/o 2020)  reminding me that I still have the option to create an alumni handshake account. Wondering if this has any real advantages, like companies on there will give me some kind of special consideration for being a WF alum that are worth the trouble of setting up an account."

Is there a good resource for rentals in that area that students or even non-students use? 

Also, would anybody recommend a good area for somebody around 25 that has already started a family... That is maybe close to the med school?

There are shockingly few university resources allocated to helping people in this situation. 

I'm trying to help him as much as I can and I figured you all might have some good insight.

I am currently a high school senior (female) in southern california. I am thinking about applying to wake forest by January 1. However, I wanted to know what you all think about the internships and jobs post graduation the university has or hasn’t set you up with? Also do you think being in North Carolina possibly isolates you from businesses and other large employers? Lastly, overall what do you believe to be the pros and cons of the school.

Thank you!"

We have now added post flairs so that people will have a better indication of what you are posting, and so we know what to expect from you. There have been individual flairs for quite some time now, but you can make your own now as well.

We have not decided on whether to start cracking down on discussions if they get out of hand, however, they will be locked if needed. If out of line and disrespectful, members may be banned or suspended. We don't really want to do this because we think it has been pretty respectful in previous posts, but you can help us by appropriately reporting when need be.

We are client focused, which means we do not engage with the protesters. Basically, this is a great gig for anyone who wants to do more direct access work on the abortion issue who also won't feel super compelled to just come to argue with protesters the entire time lol.

We are an incredibly easy to get involved with and FLEXIBLE volunteer group! While shift times are firm, we do NOT have commitment requirements or shift signup requirements. We simply ask for folks to come out and join us when they can and as often as they can handle.

Option 1: 4BR/3BA. 1.2 miles from campus. $1200/mo rent. All of the rooms are pretty different, so individual rent could potentially range from $240 to $450. I room in the attic (which I would claim), and 2 rooms on the main floor (one of which Michele would claim). The bottom floor is really spacious and could technically fit 2, but those two people would have to be really comfortable with one another; due to the way the rooms are set up, one roommate would have to travel through the other's room to get to the stairs/bathroom. If just 1 person stays down there, their rent would be $450 because they'd have the entire floor to themselves.

Option 2: 4BR/2BA. 1.7 miles from campus. Really cool house, buffered from the neighbors with a big lawn and a forest in back. It also has a pretty cool ""party basement"". We negotiated the rent down to $1050/mo the first year, $1095 the second year if we agree to sign a 2 year lease and clean the place up ourselves before move-in. Rent would be split pretty evenly among all 4 roommates.

Your roommates would be 1 woman and 1 genderqueer person, and 2 cats, plus whoever else decides to sign with us. We are openminded and just ask that you be respectful and chill. We would like to have at least one male roommate because we prefer co-ed living arrangements to single-sex.

My roommate is buying a house and will be moving out at the end of October so I'm looking for a new roommate.

The house is a newer (10 yrs old) 3BR/2BA home near Stratford Road and Silas Creek Parkway in West W-S. It's situated in a quiet neighborhood with a small, but private back yard. All on one floor with an attached 1-car garage. Has central A/C, gas heat, washer/dryer, and dishwasher. Mainly carpet with vinyl floors in the kitchen and bathrooms.

I graduated college ~3 years ago and work full-time so mid 20's-30's is preferred. Grad student would be ideal but certainly not required. Looking for someone who is very laid-back, honest and a dog-lover (have a 3.5 year old, well-behaved, ~45 lb, very short haired dog). No preference on gender.

Currently, the third bedroom is not being used (other than to store some music equipment) so moving in sometime between now and November 1st is an option. Rent is currently $470/mo for the master BR & BA and $425/mo for one of the other rooms (however, this can be negotiated if need be).

PM me for more details and info. Thanks!"
