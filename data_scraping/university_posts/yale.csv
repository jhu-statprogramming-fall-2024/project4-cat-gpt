Do full-time staff members have any education benefits?

Tangentially, if I were extended an offer, I'd be relocating from another state. Do they offer relocation assistance? Which NH neighborhoods do you recommend for young professionals/families?"

 Currently I use BCBS PPO in another east coast state without hiccups or referrals to see a doctor in Boston. Almost everywhere is in network. I'm trying to keep my doctors and be able to access clinical trials around the country if need be.

I see there is Anthem BCBS PPO on the marketplace but I wouldn't get any subsidies since Yale would be offering Aetna.

Some pee also leaked onto my mattress topper, but I'm not even asking her to wash/replace that. I talked to my friend about it and she said I should just compromise and have her wash the sheets for me, but this is crazy, right?

Burner account for obvious reasons. I’m a freshman at Yale right now living in my dorm and am very upset with the lack of goth girls at this school. It seems like all of the girls here are just interested in getting drunk every weekend and listening to Taylor Swift (Who doesn’t even make good music btw). Not much variety of women at this school and it’s honestly disappointing, I was hoping for more. I know for a fact that there are many men here that feel the same way as I do about the shortage of goth mommies at this school. Maybe I’m just looking in the wrong places, but based on what I’ve seen, there are barely any goth girls in Yale. I have been strongly considering transferring because of this issue, so if any of you know where I can meet goth girls on this campus or near it, please message me. Thanks!"

Math Requirement for Econ Major,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/1ftdj2v/math_requirement_for_econ_major/,6,6,2024-10-01 02:28:08,"Hi all! 

I’m a prospective double major in History + Econ. 

I understand that calculus is a very integral part to understanding many of the fundamental terms/concepts in economics, but I’ve heard varying opinions on how much calculus is actually needed for the econ sequence at Yale.

On one hand, many people swear by the math sequence (up to 120) to be successful in majoring in econ, while many others say that the highest level you need is just Calc 1 (110/111 or 112) as Intermediate Micro and Econometrics teaches you all the calculus (eg lagrange multipliers) you need to succeed in those classes. How true is this? 

I’m not the best at math. I tested into 115, but I will definitely need to drop to 112 as I need to brush up on my Calc 1. I also am incredibly terrified of Calc 3, and I don’t want to put myself through it if it will not benefit me increasingly in Intermediate Micro & Econometrics.

If the math requirement is a too much, I am scared I will be swayed to just major in history (lol)! I am definitely interested in the humanities leaning side of the econ electives and not so much the heavier finance-math side. So the question also comes down to if the econ major is even right for me.

I'm a rising high school senior that's applying to college for the 2025-2026 school year. Very recently, I had the privilege of visiting Yale University for a week, and I loved my stay (by the way, we got to stay at Silliman College. I was told that it was one of the nicer ones on campus? I figured it was the case but if it is, what are the other rez colleges like?). I had never even considered applying until now, but I know that I want to. The only thing that I have my doubts on is the major I want to pursue.

I'm interested in many academic topics from the arts to phycology and neuroscience, but when applying to school, I want to major in computer engineering fist. Yale does not have that, however. Their version of computer engineering is a collaboration between the electrical engineering department and the computer science department, ""Electrical Engineering and Computer Science."" A lot of school whose main focus isn't engineering has something like this, but they usually call it something like ""Electrical and Computer *Engineering*, ""clustering it with Electrical engineering under the same department, so here's where my question for Yale engineers come from:

* Is this major ABET accredited or is it just a bachelor of science? The overview doesn't specify.
* If you have this major, know someone that has this major, or are simply an engineering student, how would you describe your experience as an engineer at Yale? And do you feel like the classes you're taking what you were expecting when picking your major?
* That second question should have really been two bullet points
* With this major specifically, does it feel like a mish mash of the two other majors? Or would you say that it's its own stand-alone academic major unique from ELE and CS?

I truly appreciate your time, thank you!"

Freshman Course Schedule Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/1el6gmp/freshman_course_schedule_advice/,3,4,2024-08-06 02:29:41,"Hi everyone!

I'm an incoming freshman, and I was wondering if the schedule below would be manageable. I'm choosing between majoring in either Economics or Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Economics, or maybe a double major. I've put dashes next to interchangeable classes. Could anyone please give me advice on which classes to take (out of the dashed ones), whether this course schedule would be manageable, and whether I should change the order of my classes (like moving one class to second semester and another to first)?

For context, I've already taken Calculus II, but I didn't pay much attention to learning because it was my final year in high school. I'm primarily concerned about the Intro to CS class and whether that will take up too much of my first semester as I meet new people and adjust to college life.

FALL SEMESTER:

1. ECON 115: Intro to Microeconomics
2. MATH 115: Calculus II
3. CPSC 100/ENAS 130: Intro to CS
4. First-Year Seminar

SPRING SEMESTER:

1. ECON 116: Intro to Macroeconomics
2. MATH 120/ENAS 151: Multivariable Calculus
3. Language (not sure if I want to continue Spanish or take a new one)
4. ENGL 114/120

Thanks in advance for your advice!

Edit: Let's assume that I move Intro to CS to the spring semester (replacing CPSC 100 with CPSC 112). What would you suggest I move up then? Also, do you think it would be a good idea to make this change?"

Apologies in advance for what probably seems like a really stupid, stuck up post, but I thought posting made more sense than continuing to overthink and get stuck in my own head. This might be a longer post. 

I chose to commit to Yale over Harvard this year. While I know I definitely won’t regret being at Yale in any capacity, now or ever (or literally as soon as I get on campus), I keep wondering what if I made the wrong choice by turning down Harvard. I chose Y over H mostly because of community, intellectual atmosphere, and general vibes from faculty and students. I’ve also been fortunate to talk to quite a few cross-admits who also chose Y over H, and found everyone to have similar reasoning. 

But now weirdly my mind is wondering “what if I made Harvard seem worse/scarier in my head than it actually is?” “What if it’s really not as cutthroat/competitive as some of the stories I’ve heard, and turned Harvard down because of irrational fear?” And so forth. People keep asking me why I didn’t choose Harvard, almost as if it’s absurd to choose Yale in this case. I hate feeling this way because it completely undermines how much I love Yale and how I genuinely saw myself thriving here.

I come from an international background (did HS in the US), and I got into quite a big fight with my parents when I told them I wanted to stick with Yale. Though they ended up supporting my decision and have started to come around, they kept insisting that I was “settling” for a brand that’s “lesser.” I feel like I’ve since internalized a lot of their arguments—mostly that Harvard > Yale in prestige, and that it will somehow open more doors. To them, the Yale name will never match up because Harvard just has that “halo” or mythology surrounding it—that, if I just made it thru these 4 years, I would be a part of that myth too. Though I know that it’s a faulty argument and college should be way more than brand/prestige (like, come on, it’s YALE), it does weigh on me. As stupid as it sounds, it’s like I gave myself an inferiority complex by presupposing Harvard as “better,” even if I know I’m splitting hairs here.
 
TL,DR: I chose Yale and not Harvard because I didn’t want the H name to be my biggest reason, but now that I go to Yale for real, I don’t know why I’m suddenly second guessing it. I guess I’m wondering if anyone has advice on how to stop thinking this way. Harvard horror stories might help (jk). I’m sorry if these thoughts offend anyone—that is not my intention.

Does anyone here remember JD Vance at Yale?,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/1e7ilz4/does_anyone_here_remember_jd_vance_at_yale/,0,4,2024-07-20 00:14:18,"Anyone remember JD or Usha at Yale law school? What were they like?

>After graduating from Ohio State, Vance attended Yale Law School on nearly a full-ride.[21] He became close friends during Yale's orientation with future Canadian Conservative member of parliament Jamil Jivani.[22] During his first year, professor Amy Chua, author of the 2011 book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, persuaded him to write his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.[23] He was an editor of The Yale Law Journal, and graduated in 2013 with a Juris Doctor degree.

>Around 2011,[270] Vance met his wife, Usha Chilukuri, while both were graduate students at Yale Law School,[271] and described her as ""my Yale spirit guide""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance

Vance's inspiration was Yale law professor Amy Chua!

>It was at Yale where Vance gained a mentor in the form of his contract law professor, Amy Chua, 61. Chua, who earned her bachelor’s and law degree from Harvard, pursued a career in corporate law before leaving for academia. She first taught at Duke Law School before joining Yale in 2001.
Chua, who gained notoriety for her 2011 memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, encouraged Vance to write Hillbilly Elegy.
“I always thought J.D. was destined for great things, and that going the conventional route would actually slow him down,” Chua said of Vance in a 2017 interview with The Atlantic.

As the title says, I’m an incoming freshman, and I feel like I made the wrong choice by committing. Yale was always my dream school and when I got the acceptance letter I never felt anything like that before I mean I literally cried over how happy I was I didn’t even know I could do that.

So later I got an invite to attend their admitted students weekend and I was ecstatic. But when I arrived I for some reason didn’t share that feeling of disbelief or excitement from walking on campus and seeing the fruits of labor finally manifest before my eyes like everyone else did. Instead, I felt so alone. I couldn't relate to anyone, and many of the people I met seemed pretentious. Of course, not everyone was like that; I met some of the nicest and coolest people there as well. But I’d be lying if I said the pretentious ones didn’t sting.

I remember walking to an event and overhearing one of the upperclassmen say, “I guess they’re just admitting anyone now,” and they also claimed that the prefrosh were ""midgets"" this year. Compared to the people at Yale, she wasn’t entirely wrong—everyone there seems so tall. Coming from someone who’s 5’8 from the Bay Area, where the average height is like 5'8"" or 5'9"", but was still a crazy thing to hear and kind of made me insecure about my height for the rest of my stay.

I mean yes it was amazing to be around people who were driven like me who wanted to accomplish bigger things but I also felt like I couldn’t relate to anyone. It seemed like everyone came from an elite family or a family with incredible accomplishments, while I was just a first-gen, low-income student who came from a family that owned a small liquor store.  The whole time during the event I didn’t feel like exploring campus I just wanted to stay in the dorms and count the days until I went home and to make matters worse I missed my flight because Yale booked the shuttle to drop us off off 10 minutes before my flight.

 I feel like I only committed because I didn’t want to give up this opportunity, but now I’m scared I made the wrong choice. I mean, I literally live across the country. I’m scared of packing up and moving so far away. I’m scared of being alone. I’m scared of not fitting in. I’m scared of going to this school and not being able suffice for my parents sacrifices. 

Even now I know I should schedule my plane ticket and pack my stuff and meet with my advisor but I just can’t bring myself to do it this was my dream school for so long but it just didn’t turn out to be what I wanted. 

I know I’m rambling, but I just can’t help but feel like I made the wrong choice. If anyone’s been in this place before or in a similar situation, I would really appreciate some advice."

First-Year Math Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/1e1gbiw/firstyear_math_question/,2,4,2024-07-12 12:22:38,"Hi everyone,

So I’m still very much undecided about my first-semester math course (prospective econ major here), and I’m wondering if someone can give me some guidance. I’ve got a 5 on BC, and I’m thinking the placement exam should go pretty smoothly based on what everyone else says. Now assuming I don’t bomb the hell out of it — in which case this entire question is irrelevant anyways — what would the best course of action be as far as multivariable calc/potentially linear algebra? 

It seems other threads say 120 is hellish and poorly taught, and anyone with enough foresight will take enas151 for the better teaching and lower competition levels. I don’t think I plan on doing a math major (I’m definitely not math Olympiad material or anything), but I did have a calc teacher who inspired me enough to make me faintly consider it. In that case, 120 would obviously be the best course of action. Nevertheless, I still think it’s really unlikely that that math major theory will actually withstand the test of time. In that case, would I simply be better off on enas151? I know they say 120 emphasizes econ applications, but I wonder if the extent of that emphasis makes it worth it despite the complaints about poor teaching quality/excessive competition. Or who knows; maybe those complaints are completely outdated anyways. The threads are relatively old, after all. "

Best Jobs for Grad Students?,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/1dtcox8/best_jobs_for_grad_students/,9,3,2024-07-02 03:58:21,"
Hi everyone,

I'm starting my graduate studies at Yale this fall, and I'm looking for some advice on the best job opportunities for grad students on campus or in the surrounding area. Ideally, I'm hoping to find something that balances well with a demanding academic schedule, offers decent pay, and perhaps even relates to my field of study.

Are there any on-campus positions that are particularly sought after by grad students? How about off-campus jobs that have flexible hours and are grad student-friendly? I've heard mixed things about working as a TA, research assistant, or in administrative roles—any insights on these?

Additionally, any tips on where to start looking or who to contact for job openings would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!"

Hello! Yale '23, have been living in New Haven post grad.

I urgently need to rehome my 6-month-old female Syrian hamster, Soli, as due to a family emergency I am moving back home (internationally) **the 28th of June**, indefinitely. I want to find her a **loving and responsible new home** where she can thrive.

**I can deliver her to your location to ensure she transitions smoothly to her new home.**

If you're interested in giving Soli a loving home or know someone who might be **(within a few hrs radius of New Haven)**, please reach out. I want to ensure she goes to a home where she'll be well cared for and loved.

Thank you!

What's included

* **One very cute hamster.**
* **Niteangel Vista Habitat**: A spacious and well-equipped enclosure perfect for her needs (4x2x2 ft).
* **Gear**: All necessary accessories, including her wheel, hideouts, toys, and other essentials.
* **Bedding**: I have 1 month ish of bedding left, which will be all yours.

She is so much fun to watch as she goes about her foraging and exploring of her habitat! She's very curious and smart, has very strong likes and dislikes, has a refined palate (loves: Timothy hay sticks, hates: non organic carrots), and has grown comfortable and happy in her environment and with humans being around, but with limited physical interaction. We have a very peaceful and quiet home together, and she is a very comforting and charming presence, especially if you are a night owl.

I just graduated high school and I committed to going to Yale. I'm planning on doing a double major with mechanical engineering and economics, but I do have a few questions about my major and Yale in general, so if you guys could help me out, that would be great!

1. Am I still able to get an ABET-accredited Engineering degree while still doing a double major with economics? If so, how feasible is that to do? (I don't plan on working in America)
2. Will I be able to do a semester or year abroad  in my junior year if I were to do a double major?
3. Are the placement tests to skip Math 112 and Math 115 difficult?
4. How are the internship opportunities at Yale? I want to either be a petroleum engineer or an engineering consultant when I graduate, so how are the opportunities in that regard?
5. If I were to pursue this double major, would I still have free time to do extracurricular activities, go to the gym, have a relationship/social life, and get enough sleep?
6. How hard is it to maintain a good enough GPA (3.0+ hopefully), especially with this double major?
7. Kind of related to the previous question, generally speaking, how are the final exams at Yale?
8. If anyone has used Yale's counseling service, is it good, and how frequently can we meet with them?
9. In general, how are the dorms?

I'm an international student and I'm pretty anxious about moving across the globe to go to Yale, so sorry if I have a lot of questions; you don't need to answer all of them. Any help would be great. Thank you!"

What are some disciplines or majors with the most difficult reading requirements? By difficult I mean

* the quantity required to be read per day. I am an electrical engineering major and had on average 50 50-odd pages per day of textbooks, research papers, technical manuals, etc.
* the difficulty of the text. I would assume majors like philosophy will have nuanced writing whereas fields like sports science will be relatively less dense and more facts-oriented (no offense intended)
* task requirements.. fields like mathematics where you have to produce proofs from first principles require a deep understanding of the material. In contrast, in my field Electrical engineering, it was more of a plug-and-chug problem and designing things practically.

I know there may not be a single answer to this. I am asking to benchmark my reading skills against folks from the most in-demand discipline and see where I stand. I'll try reading some of their stuff and see how many pages I can get through in a day vs how many they're able to breeze through."

We're FGLI and I just think I could better prepare her a bit better for some of the dumb stuff I had to deal with early on. 

Has anyone noticed that being a sibling made it easier (e.g. a younger sibling getting into Yale and not other selective schools)?

Both students and faculty here lost a lot of confidence on her in the recent times. As she is moving to your university now, you might want to have a look at the following things. 

1. [May 6th 2024 university senate](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/univ-senate/senate/minutes.php#2023-2024) She kept contradicting herself in the recording while the faculty are grilling her. She allowed university police to seize mobile phones without warrants. Favoritism while enforcing policies. Mischaracterized [university-wide emails](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/pres/from_president/messages.php). 
And many things more. Faculty have collected evidence for everything :)

Edit: police chief has [previous substantiated](https://www.50-a.org/officer/S8RK) complaints about illegal use of force and frisk/search

She called in state troopers. She said that's the right decision. But at the same time she admitted in the senate meeting that protesters were very non-violent and had no physical threat. 

2. [May 13th 2023 university senate](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/univ-senate/senate/minutes.php#2023-2024)

Summary- Maurie McInnis has faced considerable criticism during her leadership roles at UT Austin and Stony Brook University, particularly for her authoritative and non-consultative leadership style, which has led to strained relations with faculty. She has been criticized for poor communication, a perceived dismissive attitude towards faculty concerns, and handling sexual misconduct allegations inadequately, which resulted in confusion and protests. Additionally, her restrictive free speech and protest policies at Stony Brook have been contentious, culminating in the arrest of student demonstrators. Her departure from UT Austin was also mired in controversy, with some believing she lost the confidence of the university's board and president.

I have only listed the known cons. There are many pros such as her fundraising abilities, support for liberal arts, and efforts to diversify faculty.

Good luck! :)

The posts from u/trstne are an interesting edge case because I don't think they are a Yale student, but the photos are interesting and presented without obvious bias -- though they do lead to predictable shitshows in the comments.

I'm an incoming freshman filling out the housing form! I'm lucky enough to have the option to choose Hopper, JE, or Pierson for my residential college and I'm wondering if anyone has advice on which to pick, or if I should just go random.

I've heard good and bad things about all three- Hopper has great location but terrible dining, JE is loaded but a bit pretentious, Pierson is beautiful but has some rat issues(???) I'd love to get some more insight. Specifically:

* How does the dining differ between colleges? Is it significantly better/worse in any particular college?
* What specific amenities does each college have? I think I heard that Hopper has a pottery studio- do the others have cool things in their basements?
* Are any of the facilities significantly more run down than the others? (Especially in terms of bathrooms)
* Any general vibes that each college is currently known for?

I'd also be down to go random for the full sorting experience, my only hesitation is that I'd like to be on Old Campus freshman year and I'm not the biggest fan of Morse & Stiles architecture.

By no means am I trying to sound less appreciative of the opportunities that I have, but I’m so confused on what to choose at this point. I’m first generation and my parents are sweet, but not the greatest when it comes to helping pick colleges. 

For context, I’m planning on majoring in engineering (CBE at Princeton, BME at Yale, or MENG with Bio concentration at UChicago) on the pre-medical track. My main focus is pre-med, so I am not really focused on prestige. I also got similar financial aid offers from each school and am in the process of appealing. 

I feel really scared that I’ll mess up and won’t succeed because of any mistake that I make. I feel that I’m not up to par with so many other students that have done such amazing things and are already miles ahead in terms of academics due to coming from a rural public school. 

Princeton Pros:

* stronger in STEM 
* more undergraduate research opportunities
* great undergraduate focus
* one of the best engineering departments in the world
* great alumni network
* beautiful and safe campus

&#x200B;

Princeton Cons:

* grade deflation (as a pre-med major I heard that GPA is a big concern when applying)
* students seem to be more stressed out about grades
* not as many premed opportunities
* eating clubs give me an off vibe
* secluded campus

&#x200B;

Yale Pros:

* great for premeds (lots of opportunities to volunteer and shadow)
* access to town and transportation 
* happier student body? more relaxed and collaborative
* grade inflation (good for med-schools and less stress for grades despite similar academic rigor)
* residential college system has better community
* great interdisciplinary approach

&#x200B;

Yale Cons:

* weaker in STEM areas, esp engineering
* heard a lot of bad things about New Haven
* not as big alumni network
* equal graduate and undergraduate populations
* not as many opportunities for research

&#x200B;

UChicago Pros

* great interdisciplinary approach to learning through CORE
* good access to opportunities within Chicago
* has medical school on campus 
* friendly faculty 
* pre-med advising I’ve heard to be pretty great

&#x200B;

UChicago Cons

* grade deflation or lack of inflation
* Hyde park is not the best for students
* little bit more expensive than the other two
* MENG is relatively new
* uchicago is where fun goes to die T-T
* terrible weather
* relatively more humanities focus? has been focused on STEM in recent years 

Everyone is saying to just go with whichever one feels better, but they all are so amazing in my opinion and have their own pros and cons that make them less or more favorable. 

I don’t know where to commit right now and find myself switching schools every other day and overthinking about everything.

To current students, current premeds, and anyone available, why did you choose Yale? Why should I?

Deciding between Yale and Stanford CS.,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/1c6evx2/deciding_between_yale_and_stanford_cs/,16,26,2024-04-17 16:52:14,"TL;DR: please convince me to choose Yale over the best CS school

I am grateful to be accepted to all of my top choices!! I am heavily leaning towards Yale right now.

I love Yale’s collaborative, tight-knit environment and residential colleges. It really feels like home. Stanford feels too isolated, and the campus is too spread out to have any meaningful spontaneous encounters with friends.

I’m from the Midwest so both schools are equally far from my hometown.

Here’s a list of what I like about both schools:

Yale:
+ Small classes, ability to get to know professors personally
+ Rich liberal arts education 
+ Music opportunities 
+Food
+Residential colleges
+Beautiful gothic architecture 
+Proximity to NYC

Stanford:
+Weather
+ VC and startup opportunities 
+ Best school for CS and AI 

I’m thinking of founding my own AI startup in the future, so there’s that for Stanford.

Yale is a little more affordable too.

I’m also thinking of getting a Masters degree in CS or going to law school (potentially at Yale)

So, where would you suggest I go?

I'm planning on majoring in neuroscience and going pre-med, and online UPenn is apparently a more 'pre-professional' environment, and better for pre-med. But it's YALE?? I honestly liked Penn's campus better, but my Yale visit was a lot less recent so that could also account for it. The financial aid at Yale is also better, plus almost every family member is leaning heavily towards Yale. I've been told that Yale will open more doors, and has a more collaborative enviromnment, but the only thing keeping me from committing is the fear that I will regret turning down UPenn. I should also add that UPenn was one of my dream schools, whereas I applied to Yale just on the off-chance I would get in. My Yale interview went great though, and I was actually more hopeful that I would get in afterwards. I don't know if I would completely fit in at Yale, it seems very artsy and has a light academia aesthetic if that makes sense? And I don't think that completely fits my vibe. I DO know that it has one of the highest international student populations, and I can't judge the school (either schools) off of my own preconceived notions, which is why I'm here. I'm international and can't attend BDD as well, so asking students is really all I have. Thanks for reading/helping!

I was accepted to Yale RD and am concerned about my chances of being rescinded. I have taken numerous Dual Enrollment courses with a local college in addition to one being taken at the college on campus.

For Mid-Year Reports, I did not send the transcript from this college as I didn't think I needed to (every other course was listed on High School Transcript). However, I now realize I will be sending this college transcript for the Final Report (which includes the grade from the on-campus class).

My issue is that I got a C in this course. The rest of my grades on my Final Transcript will be A's (potentially one B), however, I am concerned since this was a college course taken outside of High School and I hardly passed.

However, I haven't contacted the financial aid office ever.

Yale/Stanford Cross-Admit Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/1btibol/yalestanford_crossadmit_question/,7,11,2024-04-01 22:46:52,"Hi everyone! I was recently blessed to be admitted to both Yale and Stanford (and Columbia, Cornell, and Williams), but it would seem that any choice would likely boil down to those two. I know Stanford is kind of the stereotypical tech/startup school and Yale is generally perceived as slightly more of a humanities school. Obviously you can’t go wrong with either school, and everyone I’ve talked to says it basically boils down to personal preference. Now here’s the thing: I’m not really certain of my own preferences. I’m definitely planning on attending Bulldog Saturday (can’t make Bulldog Days, unfortunately) and Stanford’s admitted student days, but I realize May 1st will be here before I know it. I plan on majoring in the social sciences/humanities sphere (likely a combination of Econ and possibly philosophy or history), but I’m certainly open to falling in love with a STEM subject and potentially changing that plan. Yale certainly attracts me with the EPE major and its prowess in the more humanistic spheres, but I wonder if I’d potentially feel like I missed out on Stanford’s STEM niche if I end up really liking certain STEM fields I’m curious about (EE and physics come to mind).

My main consideration right now is whether it is worth to spend around $80k/ year (Yale, JHU, MIT) for a top-notch biomedical engineering/premed program, or instead opt for a full-ride to UVA as a Jefferson scholar, which comes with a lot of additional benefits (funded study abroad, strong alum connections, priority registration, stipend) but not as strong a BME research/premed program.

Yale or Harvard!,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/1brlm9l/yale_or_harvard/,23,38,2024-03-30 16:16:50,"Hey everyone! I don’t post a lot but I’m really conflicted right now and I need some input. Besides my interviewers, idk anyone who went to harvard or Yale and I was lucky enough to get into both! But now I’m struggling to choose :(

I can’t go to bulldog days or visitas (I might be able to go 1 day) because of my school musical, so I most likely have to decide without getting that experience! A little more context— I’m mixed (black+white), so diversity and finding a strong black community is important to me :)

Yale pros:

-beautiful campus (I’m a writer, so I really want to feel inspired by my surroundings but it’s not the most important thing obviously)

-food is really good; I’m also plant-based and dairy free so food is probably an important factor

-I’ve heard Yale is a collaborative environment (I’ve connected more w people from Harvard so far, however, so I’m a little worried about finding friends!)

-I’m a theater kid and Yale is Yale haha

-yale is less expensive (not by a crazy amount)

-yale has a better undergraduate experience. I love the idea of the first year dance and first year dinner and the residential college system😍

-overall Yale has been my dream school since like middle school, but I just don’t know anymore

Yale cons:

-location? I know people have said that New Haven is made out to be worse than it is so I would love some more opinions on the area!

-I wanna major in math maybe engineering, and yale isn’t the best with engineering if I go that route

-the biggest one: I feel a little more intimidated? It may just be in my head? If it weren’t for this feeling, I’d probably commit to Yale without second thought



Harvard pros:

-this is the biggest one: so far I’ve felt less anxious talking to people going to Harvard— and I was added to a smaller gc so I got the chance to get to know people better!

-harvard is better for stem and almost every subject minus theater and maybe economics and law for grad school.

-my AO already reached out to me and my interviewer is one of the best people I met! (I think I just feel way more welcomed at Harvard so far idk. But idk if I should choose a school based off that?)

-MIT or Berklee music school dual enrollment (I sing and do music along with theater)

-the Boston location has more opportunities and Cambridge seems a bit safer?

-Harvard has a stronger name, but only by a little?


Harvard cons:

-the food, I’ve heard some bad things

-the campus? (Not super important though)

-I’ve heard it can be more competitive

-theater is so important to me, so if anyone has more to say on the theater scene, I would love to hear!

Yale or Harvard?,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/1bs0nhl/yale_or_harvard/,0,17,2024-03-31 03:27:35,"Hi! I was accepted to Yale REA and to Harvard during regular decision. As the title suggests: I’m thankful I get to make this choice but I’m really, really torn, and I thought I’d post on here to hear others’ thoughts (any and all are appreciated!).

I will be attending both Visitas and Bulldog Days. I’m an Asian international student and being part of a supportive, welcoming environment/community is really important to me. I’d like to think I’m more of a laidback person, and I thrive on collaborative engagement as opposed to competition.

As I’m writing this, I’m thinking about why I’m posting on the Yale subreddit instead of the Harvard subreddit. I guess it’s true that I’m subconciously hoping for people to tell me to choose Yale, because it’s just been my dream for so long. I’m aware that a larger proportion of people end up choosing Harvard over Yale, but I’m really scared of the prestige factor tipping it over for me.

I’m a writer/poet and I’m planning to double major in English and something else (undecided). For now, it’s probably Econ or something adjacent to Econ. Since I’m not pursuing STEM, academics at both H & Y are looking pretty level to me. Some of my biggest questions are: 1) the difference in quality of undergrad life and 2) opportunities if I go into law school or consulting.

**Yale Pros**

* **Vibes**. In my mind, Yale is really collaborative and community-minded (again, not that Harvard isn’t, but that’s not its overarching rep or at least my impression of it). During my visits to campus, I felt this inexplicable, all-encompassing sense of belonging. In short: I love Yale, but I just don’t know anymore.
* **Gut feeling.** I applied REA to Yale because it’s my dream school, whereas I only applied to Harvard on a whim because I could. But I can’t help but think that I REA’d to Yale because I thought Harvard would be “impossible.” In a way, before getting accepted, I’ve never thought of getting to know Harvard in the same way I’ve come to know Yale.
* **Academics & literary scene:** Yale has the higher ranking English department, but I know I won’t be missing out on anything at Harvard, either. Yale is also home to *The Yale Review*, which I’d very much love to get involved with as an undergrad, especially since it's a professional (and highly regarded) publication.
* **Undergrad experience.** From what I’ve learned, Yale has more of an undergrad focus than Harvard. For example, more direct access to professors. The residential college system is also so, so appealing, and I guess I’m wondering if there’s a Harvard equivalent?
* **I have more friends at Yale.** A trivial reason, I know, and I can always make friends at Harvard, but I find it comforting and honestly exciting that one of my best friends is going to Yale next year too. But, interestingly, someone I know IRL brought up how I technically have more friends at Yale because they only got into Yale (or chose Yale over Princeton/Stanford, etc.), not because they chose Yale over Harvard.
* I know that New Haven isn’t NYC, but I’d love to be close(r) to NYC. The campus is also just so so so pretty omg im tearing my hair out

**Yale Cons**

* **Location and safety?** Is Yale really a “bubble” like some say because there’s not much to do off-campus and/or it’s relatively unsafe?
* **Name recognition?** I’m under the impression that Yale doesn’t make people go “woah” like Harvard does. I know that logically this shouldn’t matter, but it’s still on my mind. I sound like such a snob; please bear with me.

**Harvard Pros**

* **Boston being a bigger, safer (I believe) city.** However, I attend high school in a town close to Cambridge and I don’t feel that attached to the city, so to speak. Will the difference between New Haven and Boston really be a disadvantage with respect to opportunities, people I’m going to meet, etc.?
* **Brand recognition.** Time and time I circle back to how Harvard is \*Harvard\*, if that makes sense. Coming from an Asian country, more people know Harvard, not Yale, and I guess I feel like I’d be “missing out” on that immediate wow factor? Not sure if this feeling will ever go away.

**Harvard Cons**

* Similar to someone else’s post earlier, I’m just really intimidated by the thought of being at Harvard. Imposter syndrome, “what if my acceptance was a fluke,” all that.
* Atmosphere/culture. I’ve spent the longest time thinking Harvard is more competitive and cutthroat, and while I know it’s not true for everything/everyone, I do wonder if that argument has merit.
* In general, I feel that people often choose Harvard just because of its brand name. But frankly, I think I’d hate myself if I let that be the biggest (if not only) reason.

Yale vs Columbia (Egleston Scholarship),https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/1brlxuk/yale_vs_columbia_egleston_scholarship/,7,8,2024-03-30 16:30:53,"Columbia (Egleston Scholar) vs Yale

Hello! I genuinely need people’s advice for this. I realize I’m INCREDIBLY blessed to be between these two, so don’t want to come off as “braggy”. I genuinely am at a loss for what to do. I got into Brown, Vandy, Rice, and Imperial College London too, but I’ve narrowed it down to Yale and Columbia for my top two options.

I love basically everything about both of them; for instance, love the NYC life at Columbia, but also love the more relaxed, traditional American college/spirit-based experience at Yale. 

For Columbia, I was named an Egleston Scholar (you can read more here: https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/academics/undergraduate/egleston-scholars). So happy about it! Tons of academic benefits regarding research that probably counter the fact that Yale probably has a stronger investment into research and undergraduate work opportunities for STEM majors (from what I’ve seen).

Love the core curriculum at Columbia, but I also found out that at Yale you can choose classes of interest outside of your major, which still allows for a humanist approach to a STEM major, but perhaps even better because you get to choose the classes. However, for Yale, I’ve also heard it’s hard to get into some of these classes that are outside of one’s major due to high demand.

I know this is like choosing between two fine wines; you can’t really go wrong. I also don’t want to seem like I’m complaining about having to make it. I realize tons of qualified applicants got rejected or waitlisted due to, at the end of the day, pure chance. But I also want to ensure I have fun and make lifelong friendships/put myself in the best environment to succeed in my career (as does everyone).

*In terms of prestige, don’t care tooooo much, but is it a general consensus that Yale is slightly more prestigious? To me, they’re equivalent, but that’s what I’ve garnered recently from people.

*The financial aid packages I got from both are essentially equivalent, so that’s a non-factor in the decision!

*Intended major: Electrical Engineering

Would appreciate any thoughts/advice. The scholarship seems to good to pass up on at Columbia, but Yale is probably my favorite atm. :)"

This is a rant/sort of personal. I was recently admitted into Yale, and I'm not sure how I'm feeling right now. I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunities this school represents, however at the same time, I feel as though I don't deserve it. I reread my essays and looked over my resume and I just don't understand how I could get in. I'm seeing some of my other friends get into other incredible institutions and they're taking it in stride, but I can't but wonder if there's something wrong with me. Idk what response I'm hoping to get, but if someone else has had a similar experience, please let me know (if you're comfortable). Sorry if this seems pretentious to those who want to be in my position right now.

Yale states that they waitlisted some 700-800 people this year, meaning a little less should accept the waitlist offer, and in the past few years they’ve admitted as few as 9 and as many as ~100 students off the waitlist. I know it’s more dependent on who declines Yale’s offer of admission and what kind of students they need to craft the class, so my own control over this is really limited.

I will be visiting Yale from Europe this coming academic year and I'm a bit lost in terms of housing. I've been looking at Airbnb and it seems that the rent for a room in a shared house varies from 1300USD to over 2000USD. Is this normal (for someone coming from Europe that is a LOT!)? Are there neighborhoods that I should avoid? And how much should I set aside for food/groceries per month? This will be my first time in New Haven (the US in general) so advice and/or recommendations are greatly appreciated!

Yale Bands -- How selective?,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/1b4kg03/yale_bands_how_selective/,6,4,2024-03-02 09:33:16,"Hi all! I'm a prospective (international) student interested in doing a PhD at Yale. One greatest passion of mine is to play the saxophone in bands, and I hope to continue the fun at Yale 😄. I'm just a little worried if I can get in one of the bands, since I'm not professional and I wasn't practicing a lot recently lol. So m**y question:** How selective are the bands at Yale?

Some background about my previous band experiences: High school bands weren't a thing at my country, so my only band experience is in my undergrad. I did my undergrad at a heavily STEM-focused university. The school had an orchestra (with strings, woodwinds, brass, percussions etc etc) but our players were largely unprofessional. The orchestra was hardly selective at all, so people easily join. We lacked double reeds (bc most double reed players seem to prefer a professional career so they wouldn't consider our school 😭). I used to play the oboe part with soprano saxophone. I would say I have quite good tone quality & intonation for an unprofessional, and I was quite good at my job of imitating an oboe.

I listen to a lot of jazz and I'm interested in joining a jazz ensemble. I'd also be happy to be in some orchestra but AFAIK, ""real"" orchestras don't usually feature saxophones as part of their woodwind section, so maybe that wouldn't be possible."

I come from a low income background, had very poor schooling till 8th grade when I went to a decent school but struggled a lot since education was much tougher than before. I worked a job after failing 11th grade when my parents went through their divorce, I worked, supported my family and my siblings got jobs, I enrolled for bachelors in Architecture at the top university on scholarship in my city Karachi. Again I had a very hard time but I managed to do very well in my first 2 years at university. Then I started to learn all the things I had missed out in my education earlier and recognised that my decision to enroll in architecture was misinformed and naive. I have taken 3 gap years at university and one between 10th and 11th grade. I interned to document a low income housing project that my professor did, interned with world bank's Karachi 2050 Vision document where I conducted extensive user and expert interviews and formed insights and am now volunteering with an NGO that teaches underpriviledged children and supports them throughout their education journey as a councellor. I also did well at Liberal Arts courses and have already written my Final Research Paper where I conducted a research for relevance of heritage buildings in the old city area to the immediate users of their localities.  Studying architecture, I realised that while I have a lot of respect for architectural education, I do not enjoy the fact that a lot of it relies on subjective matters where I find myself more compelled towards emperical truths, hence I am now interested in computer science. I have taken the CS50 course and researched a lot about what computer scientists do.

So I am a prospective high school senior awaiting all of my RD decisions, and I'm trying to get more insight on my top schools! So I LOVE YALE... I fell in love with it when I was a little girl and it feels like a fever dream being a senior and actually applying now. BUT. When I was initially finishing up my college search I didn't see my #1 choice of major at yale, and didn't really look into other major choices, and I gave up on that dream. A few months ago I decided to look through the majors, and I fell in LOVE with their poli sci program. I am usually NOT a girly who loves to talk about government (which leads to a later question), but as I was scrolling through the courses I realized that a poli sci major wasn't necessarily solely based on government but more so how government/politics affect many aspects of our lives such as psychology, education, Healthcare, etc. I would love to pursue a career in advocacy, and I feel that this could give me a good starting point. BUT I still have so many questions about the major!

1. Am I wrong about what I said regarding this program not per-se focusing on government/its functions, and it actually is? Moreover, are the classes insightful ?

2. How is your work life balence? Obviously Yale is an top school, and I by no means am expecting an easy ride, but I was wondering how your work life balence is, and how long on average do you spend on school work (homework, essays, studying, assigned readings, etc).

3. This isn't necessarily a major specific question, but it would be helpful if a poli sci student did answer it since this experience would likely differ per major. How was the transition from hs to yale as a low income student? My high-school experience has been super easy, and I haven't felt challenged because our programs aren't very well developed and tbh they are more concerned with simply passing students on to the next grade instead of genuinely teaching. I am terrified of going to a super prestigious school in general and feeling like I always have to play ""catch-up"" because I've never had to deal with genuinely being challenged.

4. How would you describe your classes overall/experience overall with your major?

5. I know that this is a B.A and doesn't have any specific math/science requirements (right??), but Ik that yale has a quantitative reasoning requirement, so any recs for someone who is TERRIBLE at math and sometimes science?

Thank you all so so much in advance for your help!!"

I took both AP Econ courses in high school and placed into ECON 121/122/117, so I was planning on taking ECON 122 this semester but I was told that there is multivariable calculus content. I haven't yet taken MATH 120 so I'm worried about how feasible this is. Because of this I ended up registering for ECON 115 instead; unfortunately this means I will be taking ECON 116 in sophomore fall, and I've heard that for the global affairs major it's really important to have finished intro econ classes by the time you applyy, so I'm worried this will affect my chances negatively.

An alternate option is to take MATH 120 this semester and then take ECON 122 fall of sophomore year, but I'm worried that since apps for the major start in the fall it'll look bad if I haven't yet taken a single ECON course at yale.

What should I do????"

I know there are people who got rejected after receiving the SID but my theory is that although people who received it can still be rejected only competitive applicants gets sent to the FinAid Office and get their package done but I don't wanna get my hopes up- 

I searched through College Confidential and Reddit (💀) and out of all 11 people I saw who posted about receiving a SID 7/11 were accepted while 4/11 were rejected/waitlisted... But I also suspect that because it's the first round they may just send more to the FinAid Office since less files and applicants to review. Most SID receivers who got accepted I saw were from RD and not REA.

Harvard - dated a computer science major from here, he came to my state for an internship at some FAANG company. He was very passable aggressive, and condescending but tried to play it off like he was giving me “advice”. He always wanted to talk about his code but tbh I never gave a shit. Wasn’t a virgin (I was shocked) but was kinda awkward and kept saying he was good in bed. Terrible kisser,  but payed for every meal at dates. Would I date him again? No and I have him blocked 

Cornell - Econ major, really handsome but clearly was a playboy who was not looking for anything serious. Really good at playing the victim, kinda narcissistic but I thought I could fix him. Every hang out involved a bed and he never wanted to go to a restaurant. Was too “busy” to send good morning messages when it was legit the bare minimum. Had a girl best friend who commented on all his posts, had WAAAY too many insta followers and posted way too many selfies. 

UPenn - my favorite 😍😍 10/10 would date this guy again If I could but distance issue. He was hilarious and super creative. Would be the type of guy to say “hey wanna hear something cool?” Instead of texting me “wyd” he had amazing art and literary skills and we would talk for hours about our favorite authors (we had a lot in common) he was sooooo sweet and throughout with his words and honestly biggest green flag of a guy I’ll ever meet (I’m still not over him)

Columbia U - fuck him. He’s a little rat ass bitch who just wanted to hookup and got annoyed when I wouldn’t let him hit. 

Princeton - BIGGEST FUCKING NARCISSIST IVE EVER MET. I’m not even kidding. He gaslighted me so much and would always find a way to blame me for HIS insecurities. (He had money tho 🤑) would offer me to come to his apartment and stay over if I needed, he was always so considerate whenever I’d be sad but idk he gaslit me so much so I feel like it was an emotional tactic 

Yale - okay I really liked him but he was way too busy. Pre med and never had time to hang out so didn’t work out 

Brown university - he was goofy, had a TikTok personality and we got  along really well. I thought he was gay at first tho cause he knew too much about women. He knew what an “everything” shower was. We’re still friends 

I have not dated someone from Dartmouth yet but working on it

At the same time I applied to some colleges in the US to have a plan B in case I don‘t like medicine. After finishing my first semester, I got an offer from Yale. Although I enjoyed medicine, the offer obviously seemed too tempting to reject, so I at least wanted to try it out, so I would not regret it later on. After putting my medical education on hold upon finishing my first year, I am now 6 weeks into my first semester at Yale, studying Computer Science and Economics. Though, it sometimes feels like what I‘m learning is lacking the “substance” or “meaning” that the material in medical school had.
I now basically have a couple of days left to decide if I want to go back to Germany and continue studying medicine where I left off.
I genuinely do not know what to do or where my passions lie, but I do know that I have been starting to miss medicine recently.
The costs are not a factor since medical school is basically free in Germany (which is also why I would not want to study medicine in the US), and I have a full ride for Yale.

I would appreciate any thoughts on this, and what you would have done in my case for some thought-provoking impulse!

In light of increases in electricity costs and the affordable housing crisis, I think it is reasonable to suggest to NHC a public benefit or cost-reduction from local energy production.

I believe Yale people hope to do good in the world, so please consider locating or routing power from such a project in or to an area of need, rather than central to the Yale campus. Or, both, of course.
