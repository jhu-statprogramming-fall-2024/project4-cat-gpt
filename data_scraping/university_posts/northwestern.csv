not that i regret it, yet i want to make sure the program is worth the crazy amount of loan. i wanna be a LMFT in california (where i live rn), and i wanna know if the program prepares students not only for counselors but also for LMFT. i also plan to pursue PhD in psychology (not sure which), and i was wondering if this is a common route? 

i did some research before i applied, but i would like to hear from the folks here who know better than i do! thanks in advance, and i apologize if the post doesn't make sense in some places :/"

Is anyone a Humanities Major in the NU School of Professional Studies?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/1gw8tht/is_anyone_a_humanities_major_in_the_nu_school_of/,4,4,2024-11-21 05:20:31,"I attended the NU *University College* 28 years ago, and studied Classics, Art History, Econ, Stats, Logic, Baroque composition, Early Christian History, etc.. I **loved** the rigor, more dedicated senior faculty time, smaller classes, and more serious students than the day school.

I transferred to the day school then for 2nd yr Latin and was discouraged by the lack of discipline, untrained grad student teacher, and lower academic caliber than my HS (New Trier), so I transferred to Cal College of the Arts, then just proceeded with an Ad career in SF. *I'm sure most NU undergrads were, and still are more dedicated. :)*

Moving back I see they've dropped most liberal arts majors w/the *SPS* rebrand. So I'm considering resuming/finishing my Bachelors w/ the now generalized Humanities or Psych major. I'd prefer Hist / Phil / CogSci if they were offered, though it seems one can no longer transfer SPS-to-Weinberg.

**Is anyone here enrolled in the SPS Humanities or Psych undergrad programs?**

Any insights on the SPS experience, culture, and student body today would be much appreciated!

I'm also considering the Columbia U *College of General Studies* and Harvard *Extension School* degree programs, both of which have richer course and major offerings, but really prefer being able to attend and engage with classmates and profs in-person."

" A guide to eating lactose free at Northwestern

Cow piss lurks at every corner. It is meted out indiscriminately and without purpose. Outside of the sacred halls of pure eats, don‚Äôt trust anything that isn‚Äôt explicitly vegan. Don‚Äôt even look at the desserts. The vegan brownies are great though.¬†



Norris: Mod pizza has dairy free cheese. All the other toppings might poison you. Pepperoni? Who knows‚Ä¶ Honestly, if you are really lactose intolerant you‚Äôve already scoped out the allergen menu online for the place and know what‚Äôs ok. 847 Burger‚Ä¶nope. Don‚Äôt even bother. The fries are fine, everything else is tainted. Taco place?? I don‚Äôt know the name. Avoid the obvious and you‚Äôll be ok.¬†



Frans: Vegan tenders and fries. That‚Äôs it. Do not trust the burger buns. In fact, don‚Äôt trust anyone. Cow piss is insipid and dangerous. It‚Äôs everywhere. It corrupts the soul.¬†



Lisa‚Äôs Cafe: You‚Äôll get tired of saying ‚Äúno cheese, no sour cream‚Äù but your idiotic stomach decided lactose was enemy #1 so deal with it



Eating Out in Downtown Evanston: Evanston Chicken Shack dips and marinates their chicken in cow piss. Their fries are also suspect, probably from being fried in the same poison the chicken is. Siam Splendour‚Äôs pad thai is great and completely dairy free. I haven't tried anything else bc it's so good. 10Q chicken is a no. Honestly, in general, if it‚Äôs fried just move along. It‚Äôs not worth the risk. There is a mediterranean place with great hummus by 10Q, idk the name of it though.



Snacks: Just give up and eat healthy.¬†



Final Notes: You will eventually end up eating extremely clean. The moment you are off the idiotic, overpriced dining plan, your world will open up. Cooking for yourself will remove all worries about being poisoned. Do not tell people you are lactose intolerant. When out with friends, don‚Äôt ask about allergen menus or if there‚Äôs milk in something. Just order the fish and ask for no butter. Just order the vegan trash. Don‚Äôt play with the lactaid pills. It‚Äôs not worth the stress of whether or not you took enough. Cut the dairy. No matter how good it tastes in the moment, it will burn you long term. The white poison will either teach you self-control, or beat it into you. Regardless, in the end you must submit to its absolute and utter control over this broken, poisoned world.¬†Good luck, and frick cows."

E.g. Should non-MSE-undergrad students be expecting to do a lot of ""catchup"" work to fill the several pre-requisites listed on the core PhD classes? My undergad was in mechanical engineering, and I'm curious if this is common.

Does anyone know if all the listed pre-requisites for the core PhD classes are difficult to sub other university credits for? Are they really useful and necessary pre-requisites or should I try to get out of them? (MSE 301; 314; 316-1,2; 332; 351-1,2)

I do want to experience more rigorous MSE growth, but I am also interested to spend more of my ""extra classes"" on interdisciplinary study. I have been working in materials R&D for several years, and in an undergraduate materials research lab for a couple years, so I have core interest in MSE, but also in policy and data systems. I am wondering, what is the sense of interdisciplinary collaborations at Northwestern? Is this generally encouraged or ignored or discouraged?

My two top choice schools are Northwestern and Columbia, and I'm not sure yet which I'd rather attend. But Northwestern I have a significantly better chance of getting into if I apply ED, while Columbia I'm not sure either way.

My stats are something like this:

Decent classes, 7 APs taken, all 5s and As in the 3 I have taken so far.

Decent essays imo, I did them with an advisor.

ACT score 35

GPA (unweighted): a little less than 3.9

Mid extracurriculars: one season of track, stage crew on one production, some student gov. Doing more clubs now but not putting them on because they haven't really started up yet

So my dilemma is if it is even possible for me to get into Columbia with this. I think Northwestern I may have a good shot at with ED, but without it I'm not sure. I only want to do ED if I'm sure I can't get into Columbia, because it's the only school that contests Northwestern for me. Could I get into Columbia with those stats, or should I full send Northwestern?

I am not super familiar with the hiring process of private universities.

However, they don't fund students to stay in Air BnBs, and I'm unsure how else to find accommodation for 6ish weeks that isn't a hotel. They would fund a hotel, but I've previously stayed in a hotel for 9 weeks, and I'd rather have a studio or one bed apartment. 

I'm still in the early stages of planning; I just need an okay from the staff who will be my supervisors while I'm there. They have a very close relationship with my own research group so this shouldn't be an issue. I will ask them once we hear back, but thought might be useful to ask here in the meantime.

How are the lessons? Are they going to turn you into beast like Berkeley or Carnegie

What are the internship and research opportunities that a normal (not an extra ordinary) student gets 

Generally which companies tend the graduates go. How is this for international students . I tried to look the first destination form I could not find something that pinpointed how much an ME or EEE major made on average (or I am stupid)

I'm just not sure how much I can handle considering other factors of myself. I've always been up for a challenge but for the past few months I haven't been very mentally stable and it's making everything hit twice as hard and making everything so difficult to adjust to or even hold interest in.

I know I'm not the only one going through this type of feeling since it's common at such a rigorous place but I feel like I've done horribly on everything so far (like 50-60s range) and it's just so exhausting.

Is NU Worth it for Me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/1ga56ij/is_nu_worth_it_for_me/,7,5,2024-10-23 08:01:47,"Hello everyone,

  
I've really been struggling with what I want to do in terms of application at NU recently, I've been heavily thinking about applying ED as it increases my chances of getting in by a large percentage as I have a good amount of legacy and above average stats and extra-curriculars. 

  
For some backstory I'm graduating in OR with an IB diploma a 3.8 unweighted, and plenty of good extracurriculars. I'm planning on doing premed into a surgical career and a bio-chemistry undergraduate degree. After using the University's net price calculator it would cost around $90,000 per year with room and board and other fees. 

  
I'm really wondering if applying ED is a good choice as I know it's where I would like to go but the price is quite high for the amount of time I'd be there. I'm wondering if attending somewhere such as OSU, UO, or UW would be better for the much lower tuition and then later applying to NU or the UW med schools and premed. 

  
I understand that NU allows for the pull out of the ED contract for financial reasons but my counselors have made it clear that after the contract is void NU will put you on a hypothetical black list and will not accept applications in the future for things such as graduate or med school.

please ask if you need more details or anything, the application is due Nov. 1st so I'm in a little bit of a crunch on my decision.

Seriously, I was expecting it to feel like I was visiting a high school but NU really got this right. I'll be honest, it does feel a little quaint but it's such an intimate atmosphere, and compared to games at Ryan I felt like it was easier to mingle. And oh my god the view ü§åüèΩ


Do we *really* need the new stadium? Throw a little elbow grease onto this one to upgrade the concessions and bathrooms and I think you have the best little stadium in the FBS.


As a student I would have certainly preferred walking to North Campus than the trek to the stadium (although, I did love the obligatory pit stop at D&D on the way back). As a visitor, definitely slightly harder to get to but more enjoyable because you're made to walk through part of campus. It really made it feel like you're properly visiting NU as opposed to Ryan where it feels so disconnected being nestled in the residential area. Since every B1G game almost feels like an away game, the Indiana game being no exception, I thought it was great to make them walk through our campus.


Really curious to hear others' opinions, not that it really matters because the work on the new permanent stadium is going ahead but I'm still curious and looking forward to next season's visit."

I am currently debating on whether I should swap from Math 220-2 to Math 230-1 or not.

Just had my first 220-2 lecture, after reading through the syllabus, I realized that I learned everything in 220-2 in high school alreadyÔºàall the integration techniques for this class covered. my calc skills might be a bit rusty tho coz I haven't done a single bit of calc during the summer after all my high school exams ended). 

My intended major requires the 230 sequence. My friend in 228-1(to my understanding the engineering version of 230) showed me her syllabus, it contained a lot of topics that I haven't seen, which makes me a bit hesitant and worried. I am the type of student who would study and do problems from the textbook, but honestly I'm still figuring how things work best at college. My advisor said I can switch if I want to tho. My high school is an overseas non-AP school, but I got 2 units of math 2XX for the curriculum/external exams I did. 

Basically:
Easier class, revision, an extra quarter of calc, getting bored in lectures
Versus: harder class, learning new materials, one less quarter of calc, possibly a lot more busy and with more small mental breakdowns

Would you recommend me to switch?"

I‚Äôm looking to leave a program as a practitioner, and am not as interested in pursuing research.

The MFT coursework is more interesting to me, and seems more relevant to what I want to focus on (systems-framework, multiculturalism) But, I notice that most therapists in IL are LPCs. 

I want to set myself up for success after school to eventually be in private practice, working 1:1 with adults and potentially couples.

Deciding between major on Common app,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/1fj4j0j/deciding_between_major_on_common_app/,0,4,2024-09-17 17:00:21,"So I am a prospective student planning to apply ED to Northwestern university. I grew up loving physics and my main ambition has been to become a physicist. Now, the thing is research is really grinding and although I love physics, I am not sure if I am entirely cutout for the other stuff about research, like getting grants and stuff. I also discovered that I like electrical engineering and computer science, and that I am good at programming. One particular thing that gets my attention is quantum computing, being at the intersection of computer science and physics. Now, my plan was to dabble in engineering a bit. take some courses and then decide if I want to proceed with engineering or stay with physics. However, I recently discovered that it is almost impossible to transfer into the school of engineering at Northwestern but is easier to transfer out of it. I also discovered that I can do a BS/BA dual degree or a double major but most are accessible to only McCormick students not Weinberg. Logically, it seems like the best thing to do is to apply as an electrical engineering to Northwestern and switch to physics later on. But this doesn't feel like it accurately represents my application. Also, I heard about ISP which sounded great, but there is no guarantee I will get in even if I get accepted to Northwestern. Is there any way I can mention this in my Common app without disadvantaging myself? One thing that attracts me to apply to engineering is that I have no foreign language requirements and comparatively less social sciences requirements"

GAP YEAR INQUIRY,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/1fa5u5r/gap_year_inquiry/,3,1,2024-09-06 03:44:06,"**Situation**

I'm currently an entering third-year computer science student and I'm thinking about taking a 12-16 month internship between my third and fourth year of studies, effectively for 2 semesters not including summer. The internship in question will be at a well known company, and its for a software developer role. I'm planning to take a couple of courses during the internship, so one a semester. I'm a bit worried that this might negatively impact my MBA applications in the future due to the year-long transcript gap(2 semesters), which has 1-2 courses each semester. Effectively Ill also have to take a fifth year too. But I think the nice work experience would be nice. My GPA right now is 3.61, but I know the letters of recommendation and work experience matter more. I just don't want to shoot myself in the foot down the line. Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

**Questions**

1.) Do you think the internship experience outweighs the potential drawbacks of the transcript gap? 

2.) Will the year long transcript gap disadvantage me from being admitted to the MBA program?

* **How academically rigorous (will it be too hard?)**
* **The depth of classes and options**
* **Why did you choose that major**
* **Who is successful and who is not successful in that major**
* **Career path options (or grad school options) post-graduation**
* **Any other things that tipped you in the direction that would make you recommend (or not recommend) that major**

Theater Lighting designer prospect,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/1evplxl/theater_lighting_designer_prospect/,1,0,2024-08-19 01:24:46,"Hi all!

I'm a rising senior and Northwestern prospect, and have been heavily considering applying ED to Northwestern. The main things I wanted to ask about are the curriculumn for technical theater (specifically for lighting), ease to double major in EE, and the overall enviornment for the theater tech classes.

I've heard great things about the grad programs, but significantly less about the undergrad programs, and from what it sounds like, it seems more hands on/production jobs rather than just classes. While I love the idea of having more time to explore other fields/have more of a life outside theater, I'm scared about the logistics, like if only grad students are allowed to work on mainstages, or something among those lines. My ""second"" top option is looking to be CMU, but the main thing holding me back is not being able to delcare a specialty after a full 3 semesters, and essentially not being able to design until then. Another big concern I have is the the application doesn't allow for a portfolio, which for something as visually/design focused like lighting seems kinda crazy. Is academic strength weighed more importantly than artisitc? Do they just look more at your resume and interviews? How do they evaluate admitting you as an artist without a portfolio?

Several of my friends are going to NU in the upcomming year, and have plans to double major or switch from what they applied into, and I'm curious about any restrictions. From what I can gather, most say it's pretty easy but I'm wondering if EE is too ""extreme"" or far of a reach from lighting design. The required curriculumn for lighting looks pretty light, with only a few lighting specific classes so I think timewise I should be set, but wanted to ask about how the process itself would work (sign up for EE classes and pray, consult a counsuler if I get in, etc)

From the past schools I've toured, each seems to have a certain ""type"" of tech students in the program, and I wanted to ask what the majority of tech (or just theater) students at NU are like. Additionally, I'm wondering what the alumni network is like; I know CMU's presence throughout the industry is insane, and wanted to know how much weight NU holds in the industry. I'm also hearing a lot about others transferring into theater/from other programs that do technical theater, which makes me curious about how important the degree in technical theater itself is-- is there a notable difference in calibar between those who got into the school for theater tech and those who didn't (or in other words, would it be worth applying through EE instead of technical theater or switching out of the major but working on shows)"

I understand that both UChicago and Northwestern have very competitive acceptance rates, so I‚Äôm not assuming he will get into either school. However, I have a few questions:

1. Is there difficulty registering for desired math classes at these institutions?
2.

4. Should he consider the honors track at Northwestern? Does it require a separate application? What are the pros and cons?
5. How difficult is it to transfer credits to Northwestern?

I visited Northwestern earlier this year, and was charmed by Evanston, the overall atmosphere, and the beautiful view of the Chicago skyline and Lake Michigan. I would be happy to go here.

That being said, I may be considering ED for either of these places, but these are definitely my top two for RD. I also want to note that I will be pre-med and definitely want to go to medical school in the future.

In terms of prestige, I'm aware that the program at JHU is great and almost impossible to get into, and I like the layout of the BME 2.0 program and how you can choose from different concentrations (neuroengineering for example). 

I'm less knowledgeable about BME at  Northwestern, but I heard about the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab and I'm wondering if that has been a valuable experience for anyone, and whether or not it's available to undergrads. Overall (from word of past mentors) Northwestern would be a great place to study, but I would like to hear more about why I should come here.

Also, are there any notable study abroad programs and programs/opportunities in general for BME majors at both schools? As a BME major, do we ever have projects associated with Feinberg?

Northwestern MA Clinical Psychology - thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/1etj2jd/northwestern_ma_clinical_psychology_thoughts/,2,1,2024-08-16 07:58:26,"Hi! I was researching about the MA in Clinical Psychology program at Northwestern, and I read that they've changed it from being ""designed to prepare students for doctoral study"" to ""prepare graduates to deliver science-based services at the master‚Äôs level."" 

Since the first cohort starts in Sep 2025, I understand that people may not have prior experiences about it. However, does anyone have more info about what this program is comparable to (e.g., other psychology programs at other universities)? 

The program says it equips students for licensure as Professional Counselors and Clinical Professional Counselors within the state of Illinois. Can we still take exams to be licensed in other states? What can a student who graduates from this program be equipped to do in terms of psychological research/clinical practice?

Also, if anyone knows of profs that have worked in the program before, please let me know! I just want to see what the work of the faculty in the program looks like. 

Any other thoughts or comments about the program would be super helpful! Thank you so much! "

710 Emerson - 2nd floor, with 4 rooms dedicated to continuous housing (new this year, also isn't published on housing's website. I've got proof of this if you need extra assurance)

2303 Sheridan - Historically 3rd floor in GREEN House, but has likely switched to all of GREEN House (even if it hasn't, the rest is mixed-gender and a lot of the rooms are singles). Not sure if CCS has any all-gender housing

Allison - 1st floor (Correct me if I'm wrong)

Elder - 2nd floor L-wing I think (Correct me if I'm wrong)

Slivka/Lincoln/Kemper - I've heard suites are assigned as all-gender or not, and don't have a specific location

Plex/Foster-Walker: No specific area because the whole building is singles

Chapin - 1st floor

Buildings with all-gender housing but I do not have floor information: West Fairchild, Willard

Does anyone know to what extent the 1994 Northwestern Team's players fixed their games? Seems like this scandal is lost in memory/media completely...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/1ed8ilr/does_anyone_know_to_what_extent_the_1994/,15,8,2024-07-27 05:05:44,"This scandal seems to be completely lost and almost completely forgotten about in the world of american sports. When trying to google the scandal, the only results are few single articles back from 98' regarding the legal proceedings of this case/scandal.

What happened in 1998 apparently with the FB team at northwestern seems to be very interesting and peculiar in regards to sports rigging for gambling surplus. According to the articles in 1998 (4 years later legal proceedings) 4 starters from the team were found guilty of betting on themselves to lose. 1 of the 4 starters was alleged to of intentially fumbled on the goal line by feds during a game against iowa. There were other games bet on by players that included suspicious activity from NW players as well. This article from the Chicago tribune lists out a lot crazy shit about the incident: [https://www.chicagotribune.com/1998/12/04/us-indicts-4-nu-players-on-94-team/](https://www.chicagotribune.com/1998/12/04/us-indicts-4-nu-players-on-94-team/)

Wondering if there is anyone who may of payed close attention to the team in 94' or anyone who just knows more on the scandal. No one even speaks of this event and I find that kind of shocking. I mean... We do have players who get busted gambling these days, but even then, its always just the single player being dumb (like ridley and others). NOT ACTUALLY RIGGING games... In this case, it seems like there was convictions, and a whole lot of evidence of the 1994 northwestern FB team betting on and even fixing games with little to no media attention (at least WAY less than other smaller single player cases these days).

Anyone who wants to give input, please do

A Tale of Ghosting by Northwestern‚Äôs edX / 2U Bootcamp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/1eazwej/a_tale_of_ghosting_by_northwesterns_edx_2u/,5,2,2024-07-24 12:11:50,"My journey with the Northwestern / edX / 2U coding boot camp, which began in May, has been far from smooth. I was looking forward to starting the part-time coding classes at the end of July, supported by the WIOA program‚Äôs educational voucher.

The initial interaction with the edX representative (whose name escapes me) was promising. She was diligent in following up, ensuring that all necessary paperwork was completed, and the entrance test was taken.¬†



During June, I was also navigating the WIOA program‚Äôs processes to secure the voucher, which included interviewing a developer and comparing edX / 2U with another coding institution. ¬† But this time I had some challenging questions for her and she asked if should call me back but all she did was end up ghosting me.



By the start of July, I had received no word from the admissions team, prompting me to call again. This time, I spoke with Sam. Despite his initial willingness to address my concerns, Sam‚Äôs actions fell short of his promises. He even went as far as setting up a Zoom call to discuss my concerns further. However, when the day of the call arrived, Simon was nowhere to be found. He had ghosted me, failing to show up for the scheduled meeting. This lack of professionalism and disregard for my time was deeply disappointing.



Frustrated, I called them the next day and I insisted on speaking with a manager, leading me to Candy, the admissions manager. I explained my situation, only to be assigned back to Mary, who turned out to be the original admissions representative who had previously ghosted me. With the course start date fast approaching, my primary concern was their receipt of the voucher, especially since the WIOA program had not heard from edX / 2U and the form they had filled out was incorrect.





Two weeks before the course start date, I was still uncertain about my enrollment status. Despite the WIOA program‚Äôs attempts to assist, edX offered nothing but unfulfilled promises of callbacks. A week before the course, I had yet to hear from anyone at edX / 2U. When I called, I found out that Candy was out of the office, and there was no backup so after some pushback, I was eventually transferred to Sandy, the Director of Admissions, who, despite promising to investigate my case and listening to the taped calls, also ghosted me‚Ä¶. I mean we are talking about the head of admissions.¬† In the end, Candy called to inform me that as a matter of fact, I would not be able to join the current cohort and would have to wait two months for the next one due to an error made by the social impact team on their end in calculating the total cost of the course.¬† I asked her why I would want to come back to them after all they put me through this. She mentioned the job placement which I told her I wouldn‚Äôt need.



In conclusion, my experience with Northwestern / edX / 2U coding boot camp has been marked by a lack of communication and unfulfilled promises. It‚Äôs disheartening to see such a lack of professionalism and accountability in an educational institution especially when they are using the Northwestern name.

This may be to join a club or even just to occasionally be involved in events, but at my Alma mater most things occurred during the week and I am anticipating this to be no different. Any recommendations for meeting people or just getting the most out of the NU experience as a commuter grad student? This is my dream school, so I want to take in and enjoy every second I can. If not much is available, I also understand because my studies are my first and foremost priority and I know there will need to be a lot of time dedicated to them! Thank you for any ideas!!

I‚Äôm looking for a roommate in Chicago! I graduated this past December and started working in Chicago. My college friend and I moved into a 2bed 2bath apartment, however, he‚Äôs moving away for a new job. 

I honestly love this apartment and looking to renew the lease. It‚Äôs just outside of Chicago in Evanston but we are right next to the Main St. Metra (and CTA) station, which takes you to downtown in less than 20 mins. Its 3 stations away from Northwestern campus.
It‚Äôs also just a 5 min walk from the grocery store and Trader Joes, and 5 mins away from the lakeshore, and a bunch of restaurants and shops. Evanston's friendly neighborhood and not-so-crowded beaches are a great combination with living so close to the city, and I really enjoyed living here for this past half-year.
Looking for someone to take up on the lease for the 2nd bedroom, which has its own bathroom. It‚Äôs a freshly renovated apartment with modern kitchen and the bedroom is pretty large too. I can send pics of the place if you‚Äôre interested or I can even tour it for you. 
A little bit about me, I am a male, 23, now working full time, generally chill and like to keep things in order. 

The lease starts July 31st for 12 months and the rent is $1,325 including utilities except (electric + internet).

In-unit laundry and dishwashing machine. I already got a pretty good internet, and its 25$ per month per person. The living room and kitchen is spacious, there is plenty of space to store additional items/furniture. Available covered garage parking has a fee I believe but street parking is available too."

The Legend of Northrup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/1dme3rm/the_legend_of_northrup/,35,3,2024-06-23 04:32:59,"**Legend of Northrup**

Genesis 3:14 - And God said, ""Let there be Chemistry."" And henceforth from heaven came the spirit of Confusion, roaring like a prowling lion. And God said to Confusion, ‚ÄúThou shalt go into this world I hath created and bring disorder where there is order and pain where there is no pain‚Äù. But Confusion sayeth to the Lord, ‚ÄúHow can thou servant do such a thing? I alone do not have such power‚Äù. And the Lord looked down upon Confusion with sorrow and said, ‚ÄúI hath created tools, terrible tools to help you‚Äù. And the Lord touched the mind of Confusion and taught him all the complexities of the Chemistry of the Earth. So Confusion left the presence of the Lord and began his work in earnest.¬†

15 Confusion prowled the earth for countless millennia unopposed. Humans of every generation shuddered at his name.¬†

16 One day, however, God looked upon the Earth and said ‚ÄúIt is not good for man to be without knowledge‚Äù. So out of the dirt he formed Frederick Northrup and proclaimed to the host of heaven ‚ÄúOut of the dust I have created a man who shall hold all the secrets of the Earth‚Äù. And the heavens rejoiced for it meant the end of ignorance for mankind. But the Spirit of Confusion raged. He stood before the throne of heaven and proclaimed ‚ÄúThou servant has done all thy hath asked of him. Hath I not served you well? Why do you mock me with such a creation? And the Lord said, ‚ÄúMy ways are not your ways and my thoughts are not your thoughts. You dare question the will of your Creator?‚Äù So Confusion left his presence and vowed to corrupt his Lord‚Äôs new creation.

17 As Frederick Northrup grew, so did his knowledge. He unlocked the secrets of the Earth and delighted in telling other men of them. But the Spirit of Confusion was distraught at this and knew deep in his heart that his time on the Earth was coming to an end. So he crafted a plan so that he might live forever.

18 One day in the garden, Confusion approached Northrup in form of a snake and said to him, ‚ÄúDost thy know the secrets of Organic Chemistry?‚Äù. And Northrup looked upon the snake with curiosity in his eyes and said ‚ÄúThe Lord hath proclaimed that no man should understand Organic Chemistry or he shall be forever cursed‚Äù. But the snake was more clever than Northrup and said ‚ÄúDid not the Lord create you to understand such things? Dost thou soul not yearn for eternal life? Learn from me the secrets of Orgo and you shall live forever‚Äù. So the snake touched the mind of Northrup and taught him the deep knowledge of life itself. Northrup delighted in his new knowledge for he now understood the processes that brought about Life itself--and with that knowledge he could now conquer Death.

19 But the Lord saw what had occurred and was angry. He said to Northrup, ‚ÄúDid I not say man must not know the secrets of Organic Chemistry? Cursed are you forever! For eternity you shall teach the of the Chemistry of the Earth and all thou students shall be stricken with confusion. None shall truly understand the secrets of the earth as you do, yet forever must you try to make them understand!

A lot of their volunteers are regular session NU students who leave town after the summer, and unfortunately the summer happens to be peak season for new kittens.

The shifts are about a couple hours max and involve tidying the cat rooms, feeding the cats and changing the litter, and socializing with the cats. It‚Äôs a small operation ‚Äî there are 4 rooms with 3-8 cats each, plus a quarantine room with separate cages. The work is very easy going, the people who run P&C are incredibly kind and passionate about their work.

My hope is to double major but I'm really have a hard time deciding where to go.

My future plans are to continue higher education, hopefully enter a MD-PhD Program, and become a Neurologist focusing on researching the correlation between music cognition and neurodivergence.

USC is instate for me, while Northwestern is pretty far.

Pros for USC: Diverse programs, Obviously amazing networking, not too far from my family, Access to the cognitive neuroscience imaging center, Great research faculty, Great for pre med, Great weather, Great student involvement, Semester system, ranks higher in neuroscience 

Cons for USC: still haven't received my Financial Aid award, not in the safest place, I don't really enjoy the L.A area, Limited housing (low income and parents prefer for me to stay in a dorm),

Pros for Northwestern: Amazing research opportunities, Access to Communication science disorders department, Has a Music Cognition major focusing on studying the brain and music, In a great area and not to far from chicago, Amazing faculty, Covering a lot of my tuition (about 89k)

Cons for Northwestern: Quarter system, Cold winters, unpleasant weather, A lot of students have a Intense workload, Pressure to publish, 

I know I should be celebrating, but as a first generation college student who attended community college and comes from a low-income background, I want to make sure I'm making the best decision. Any advice or insights would be must appreciated!"

Admitted Grad Student Looking for Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/1crf1gl/admitted_grad_student_looking_for_advice/,6,11,2024-05-14 00:29:49,"I am an MS EE Integrated Circuits student admitted to both Northwestern and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Both are strong EE programs so I'm having a hard time deciding. I want to go to industry after graduation. Not really into pursuing a PhD and *cost is a non-factor*. Here's a little info for both programs. Which one should I go?

  
**Northwestern EE:**

Pros:

* Course flexibility (can take courses from various fields such as Machine Learning, Cyber Security, Robotics, and IoT)
* Degree requirements are not restricting (need 6 units of any ECE courses and 6 units of any elective courses)
* Have the option to purse Thesis MS Degree, project-based degree, or course-based degree
* A lot of classes are project based. Lots of hands-on opportunities.
* Courses seem very interesting and diverse within Integrated Circuits (ASIC, Digital, Analog, VLSI, PCB, Solid State, Nano, Mixed-Signal)
* Can get a master's minor in various topics (entrepreneurship, engineering management, cyber security, etc)
* Flexibility in my specialization 
* Smaller classes (1:9 faculty-student ratio), Small cohort (10-12 students)
* Chicago ‚Äì great food, activities, and diverse people
* Good public transportation
* Travelling back to home is more accessible
* Can finish program in one year (Sept to June)
* Ranked #9 in overall university rankings

Cons:

* Engineering Career Fair seems to be lacking
* Not many top tech companies come to recruit on-campus
* No specific ECE career fair
* Ranked #17 - Graduate Engineering School
* Quarter system (seems to give more breath on courses and is more intense) 

**Michigan ECE:**

Pros:

* World renowned faculty
* Great Advising and Career office
* Lot of big companies come to recruit (NVIDIA, Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, etc)
* Multiple career fairs and have ECE specific career fair
* Semester system
* Ranked #4 ‚Äì Electrical Engineering School
* Ranked #7 - Graduate Engineering School
* One of the best ECE schools in the world
* Can be completed in one year (Aug to May)
* EECS 427: VLSI Design I course is highly regarded in the eyes of industry recruiters

Cons:

* Coursework is more restrictive (have to choose from a pre-determined list of courses: 9 credits from a list of core courses, 7 credits from a list of non-cores ECE courses, 4 credits from a list of 5 project-based courses, 6 credits from a list of entrepreneurship courses)
* Courses do not seem as interesting and are more time consuming
* Can't get credit for research due to MEng degree
* My specialization cannot change (Microelectronics and Integrated Circuits)
* Less accessibility to travel home
* Might have issues with transportation

**Follow-Up Questions:**

1. What big tech companies come to recruit at NU (hardware roles)?
2. What support does the engineering career office offer to NU students?
3. Should the difference in ranking be a big consideration? 
4. How does NU set one up for success with recruiting? 

Sorry if this is a very long read. I appreciate any advice, thanks! "

Quant - Math 310 Sophomore year or Math 450 Junior Year?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/1cqosq7/quant_math_310_sophomore_year_or_math_450_junior/,7,5,2024-05-13 02:38:42,"I'm currently a freshman with a CS/Math double major interested in quant finance trying to choose my classes next year. I know that typically, its probably best to try to take probabilty/stochastics early on. Math 311 looks good to me, but it conflicts with CS 214 all year which would make it a no go for me with how many CS classes are locked behind that one. That leaves me with basically 3 options:

1. Take Math 310 this year instead
   1. Pros: I get a probability/stochastics class early on (in time for interviews), Relatively less intense class makes for an easier schedule
   2. Cons: Curriculum seems weak compared to other Probability/stochastics classes and is not very formal
2. Take Math 321 (Real Analysis) this year, Math 450 (Grad Prob/stochastic processes) next year
   1. Pros: Very rigorous load being based on measure theory and gives very formal math training.
   2. Cons: Don't get through all of the material before interviews
3. Math 310/321 this year, Math 450 next year
   1. Pros: Get pros of the other 2 options
   2. Cons: Take twice the number of classes for essentially the same material which takes away from other classes.

People I've talked to so far seem to think that the extra rigor of a class like 450 would be very valuable later on, and I would likely take real analysis regardless, but self-studying the necessary probability for interviews seems like a tall order. If anyone with knowledge of the quant industry could help, it would be greatly appreciated.

place to store instrument as a non-music major? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northwestern/comments/1cqh1zo/place_to_store_instrument_as_a_nonmusic_major/,16,16,2024-05-12 20:22:56,"I'm an incoming freshmen at NU, I've played cello all through middle and high school and even though it isn't my major, I was really hoping to continue playing in college. I called the music school about getting an instrument locker but they said those are only for music majors. They did say I could possibly call the music faculty support office (who manage locker rentals), but I'm wondering if that's even worth it given what they told me about the locker rental policy.

Does anyone have any suggestions for things I can do? I'm having a hard time imagining having space for my cello in my dorm, and even if I did, I'm worried about carrying it from warm environment (indoors) to super cold (outdoors) and back to warm constantly.

After the scholarship, all of the costs (including tuition which is ~ 100k before scholarship) is a little under $100,000. I will have to fund this myself and unfortunately take out loans (I already have 30k in debt from undergrad). 

BUT, this program gets you guaranteed internship (unpaid)  placement during the summer, good school, and will get me connections.

I also just got a job offer for $50,000 for an entry level marketing role. I would be 22 hrs in Communications which is not what I want to do  and 18 hrs in marketing. I would have to live in my hometown another year that I have desperately been trying to claw out of (in DFW, tx. ) PLS help (the job is really chill and the boss is really nice but I really have been wanting to move out of Texas my entire life and it feels like I am stuck here) 

WHAT SHOULD I DO? Go to grad school and get. A lot of debt or go for the marketing position? 

Pls pls tell me (also I studied double major political science and communications so this is my way of switching career directions)
