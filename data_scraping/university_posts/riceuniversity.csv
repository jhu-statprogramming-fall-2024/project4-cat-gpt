Any classes that can be taken asynchronously? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/riceuniversity/comments/1ggk1uk/any_classes_that_can_be_taken_asynchronously/,3,9,2024-10-31 17:28:58,"I'm debating whether or not to take a Winter internship for next semester, and I'd have to relocate to the internship's office so I won't be at Rice.

I can't take a semester off due to my scholarship, but I'm in a position where not taking any major classes won't affect my graduation date.

Tips for going to Rice vs UH game!,https://www.reddit.com/r/riceuniversity/comments/1fdn9lo/tips_for_going_to_rice_vs_uh_game/,26,1,2024-09-10 17:15:22,"Hey Rice! Your Owls will be facing off against the University of Houston this Saturday at 7 and they will need all the help they can get! In preparation for this I’ve made a quick guide for anyone who wants to go to the game but might not know how to get there, where to sit, where to get tickets etc. 

**Tickets**

Single tickets are currently selling as low as $11 on [Ticketmaster](https://www.ticketmaster.com/event/Z7r9jZ1A7AJGV) and [seatgeek](https://seatgeek.com/houston-cougars-football-tickets/ncaa-football/2024-09-14-7-pm/6370834). Odds are the stadium won’t be anywhere near full so you should be able to purchase the cheapest tickets available and then find an empty spot somewhere you like near other Rice fans.

However, if you’re uncomfortable with the possibility of taking someone else’s seats, I would recommend buying seats on the visitor bench side close to the visitor sections. Sections 224-226 and 323-327 are listed as the official visitor sections in the [UH seating map](https://dxbhsrqyrr690.cloudfront.net/sidearm.nextgen.sites/uhcougars.com/images/2024/8/26/2024_football_map__-_08.14.24.png) so Rice season ticket holders and football team family members who got their tickets through Rice will likely be sitting in those sections.

**Travel to UH**

*Fan bus*- Rice athletics is organizing a fan bus to take fans from Rice to the game approximately 4 hours before kickoff  (3 pm). If you are interested in this option, fill out the [interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFvKpVJFwTAnrARNdy0wjfwIKKuyqJPjCcO3g4ra-pQy6q0g/viewform) sent out by Rice athletics.

*Metro Rail*- The metro rail has a stop near Rice and near TDECU stadium. If you get on the metro across the street from Rice, near Hermann park, you can ride it toward downtown. Get off on the central station main stop, then walk to Central Station Rusk or Central Station Capitol and get on the purple line train. You then get off at the UH stadium stop. The rail does charge $1.25 for regular fare. Since this would take two trains it would be $5 bucks to ride the rail to the game and back.

If you aren’t coming in from Rice you can also park in a parking garage or lot in downtown Houston then get on the closest station for the purple line. There are stops near discovery green and Shell Energy stadium if you know of a place you like to park near either of those. And if you're confused about any of this you can use google maps to route you from Rice to UH and click the transit option so it will show you the metro rail stops and routes. 

*Driving to UH*- If you will be driving to UH, be aware that parking there is difficult. I would recommend getting there early. A lot of their parking lots are reserved for UH parking permit holders. Parking lots you can expect to park in are labeled in teal, purple, black, and pink stripes in the [UH gameday parking map](https://dxbhsrqyrr690.cloudfront.net/sidearm.nextgen.sites/uhcougars.com/images/2024/8/26/2024_football_map__-_08.14.24.png), though there likely will be other options farther away.

**Tailgating**

If you plan to tailgate at your own car, you should be able to at any of the parking lots listed in the [UH gameday parking map](https://dxbhsrqyrr690.cloudfront.net/sidearm.nextgen.sites/uhcougars.com/images/2024/8/26/2024_football_map__-_08.14.24.png). Parking lots will be open to 6 hour prior to kickoff so you can start as early as 1 pm.

Rice is also organizing a tailgate in Cougar alley from 5-7. You can register for that at [this link](https://events.rice.edu/event/361778-rice-vs-uh-bayou-bucket-tailgate). Prices for that recently dropped and they do take walk-ins. And if you don’t want the food and drink you can just show up and mingle with other Rice fans!

Happy Bayou Bucket y’all! Let’s cheer our owls to a win. Rice fight never dies!"

This would help explain how the victim and the guy were ""acquainted"" in the first place (to put it mildly).   I'm just surprised this is not being brought up in the mainstream press.

My advice is this: try not to over-investigate your new home before you arrive. Of course, it's fine to learn a bit about the history and get a perk of the dorms, but don't risk tainting your view of the colleges/Rice before you even get here!

O-Week's purpose is to introduce you to life at Rice and immerse you in the culture and traditions of your residential college. Each college’s O-Week team has been preparing for months to make this transition fun and smooth, but we can only do this if you come with the right mindset! Every college has its pros and cons, but discover them for yourself once you're actually in the hedges. Avoid the negativity bias and trust your future peers to make this an experience worth remembering.

When I was a student, LPAP (taken any time) and FWIS (taken during an assigned semester freshman year) were both required, and it looks like that hasn’t changed. It looks like students now need 9 hours per distribution instead of 12. 

However, the part that I don’t understand has to do with some new labels:

-Critical Thinking in Sexuality (first semester freshman year)
-Analyzing Diversity-labeled course (Is this the same as CTIS or an additional requirement? Website says it must be taken in the first two years and is three credit hours, so I’m thinking it’s different?) 
-Critical Dialogues on Diversity (The website says that this should be taken right after CTIS, so is this basically the last half of the required course?)

However, they sent me back my offer letter, and it's way outside what I can afford. For some reason, their EFC is double what my EFC is on the FAFSA, so it's putting me around 40k for one year of what my ""family should contribute"", but you know how that goes... (it'll be *me* contributing that, in loans). 

Here's the thing: I have a 15k/year scholarship at UH, with a tuition waiver the first year and \~20k in outside one-time scholarships. Moreover, I'm done with 1.5 years at UH through dual credits and AP classes. Even if UH doesn't give me any institutional grants, I'll be paying nothing for the first year and only housing costs for the two years thereafter, and should only be in school for 2-3 years. I'm majoring in civil engineering, which I believe doesn't have a big emphasis on degree prestige, and I needed the advice of people who are going to Rice or maybe the thoughts of people making a similarly tough decision.

However, Rice said on my portal that I do not qualify for need-based financial aid.

The only explanation I have is that I'm missing parent signature on FAFSA so I never got the student aid index. I can't correct this yet because the correction function of FAFSA is not online. The FAFSA on my rice portal checklist also says complete for some reason.

# Policies Regarding Hard Alcohol Possession and Consumption on Campus

* ""\[O\]ur goals for health/safety and commitment to student self-governance are not best served by banning hard alcohol.""
* Hard alcohol should be considered anything with *an ABV of over 20%.*
* Serving hard alcohol should be prohibited in ***all public spaces*** (e.g., not in student rooms) unless part of a registered event.

# Intersection of Alcohol Consumption and Public Parties

* Publics should be organized in close collaboration with *RUPD and REMS.* Capacity is determined by *indoor space* (""outdoor space is just for 'getting air', not for overflow capacity"").
* Events with 200+ attendees that involve alcohol should require an *RSVP or ticketing process*, and students must present their IDs regardless of wristbands being issued.
* ""**Martel's Beer Bike morning party** should be changed to a *quad only outdoor event* without utilization of the sundeck...""

# Enhanced Education, Safety Measures, and Accountability

* *Alcohol education presentations* should occur more frequently, particularly for incoming students and around major events.
* *RUPD* should have a closer connection with SJP, student leaders, and core teams.
* CJs, AJs, and REMS should receive *greater support from the university*, such as from core teams.
* ""\[T\]he **'Amnesty Policy'** \[should\] be modified such that a 'warning' is issued to those in violation."" Warnings are aggravating factors in determining sanctions.
* *Fake IDs* should result in a referral to SJP and subsequent sanction.
* Colleges should submit written descriptions of ""their strategy for promoting health/safety...""; until this is submitted, their Beer Bike will remain dry.
* **""Re-launch a 'Culture of Care' campaign that specifically focuses on reasonable, responsible, and respectful alcohol consumption on our campus.""**

""Under the plan I’m announcing today, we will take the billions and billions of dollars that we will collect by taxing, fining, and suing excessively large private university endowments, and we will then use that money to endow a new institution called the American Academy.""

""Its mission will be to make a truly world-class education available to every American, free of charge, and do it without adding a single dime to the federal debt. This institution will gather an entire universe of the highest quality educational content, covering the full spectrum of human knowledge and skills, and make that material available to every American citizen online for free.""

""Most importantly, the American Academy will compete directly with the existing and very costly four-year university system by granting students degree credentials that the U.S. government and all federal contractors will henceforth recognize. The Academy will award the full and complete equivalent of a bachelor's degree. ""

There is little reason to believe that Rice University would *not* be considered to have an 'excessively large private university endowment', suggesting that it would be a target of a plan to levy substantial taxes on such universities. While Rice University would likely survive this plan, it would be unlikely to remain the same sort of place, which seems to be a two birds, one stone sort of outcome."

Any alumni going to the football game in Charlotte on Saturday (11/18)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/riceuniversity/comments/17ucyxf/any_alumni_going_to_the_football_game_in/,7,1,2023-11-13 15:23:26,"As the title says.  

If so, is anyone tailgating?  

About 5 years ago, Rice played at Wake Forest.  The Alumni Office organized local alums to gather at a restaurant near the stadium before the game.  I just checked with them and there is nothing planned for the game in CLT.  

So I was wondering if anyone is planning on tailgating before the game, and if so, where could we find you.  I'm not familiar with the campus or parking, so I don't know if there's a designated tailgate spot.

&#x200B;

I received an offer of admission for the MCS program at Rice! I have a few questions about research opportunities, and I hope some of you might be able to help with:

&#x200B;

1. Is it possible for Master's students to engage in research projects under the guidance of a professor? I'm very keen on getting involved in research during my time there.
2. For those of you who have gone through or are familiar with the process, how challenging is it to find a professor who is willing to mentor you? Any tips on how to approach professors for research positions would be greatly appreciated.
3. I'm also curious about the pay for such research positions. If anyone has information on the pay for TA or grader positions, that would be incredibly helpful for my planning.

&#x200B;

Any insights or advice y'all could provide would be invaluable!

Thank you!"

Chi Alpha Campus Ministries has been in the local and national news lately for protecting and promoting a registered sex offender as their spiritual mentor. Some concerned students and parents contacted us to get the word out to the Rice community after arresting two campus pastors at Baylor and A&M Corpus Christi, Daniel Savala, for continuous sexual abuse of minors.

Please inform your campus president and dean of students to investigate this group. We believe Rice deserves better, and we hope Chi Alpha reforms for the sake of its students and faculty.

This time of year, there are lots of posts asking about residential colleges--whether the one you got is good, what the facilities are like, what the culture is like, etc. I HIGHLY recommend joining your college's O-Week groupme (should be linked in the email!) and asking your advisors! You should also check out your college's website and, when it comes out, the O-Week book. You might get a lot of information from Reddit, but some of it will be incorrect, confusing, or overly negative.

If you're going to go into O-Week with preconceived notions about your college, it's better for them to be positive! So buy into the propaganda :D no college is perfect, but none of them suck!

&#x200B;

\-Everyone was so different to the point where we had nowhere to connect

\-Most of them also didn't make any effort to socialize.

\-Didn't end up becoming good friends with any of them. I'm chill with one of them though because we share some classes.

\-Only one adviser made any effort to organize O-Week lunches. Other 3 advisers seldom showed up and never made any effort to check up on us. About 3-4 of us show up to O-week lunches anyways.

There's three people in my O-week group that I just never see on campus or even in my college. Throughout the whole year, I probably saw them 3-4 times.

One of the first places you make friends at Rice is from the people in your O-week group. I couldn't do that. I genuinely believe that I was handicapped from making friends during O-week because of this. To this day, I'm still pissed that I wasn't put into a better O-week group."

mental health forms,https://www.reddit.com/r/riceuniversity/comments/12so917/mental_health_forms/,10,6,2023-04-20 06:09:29,"I was recently diagnosed by a psychologist with mild/moderate depression. The health forms ask me if i have any ""psychological conditions"" (obviously i do) -- but I've heard pretty horrifying stories both (iirc one at Rice) and other unis like Yale/MIT about admin being awful about mental health (like shoving people in hospitals, denying entry, etc.)

Is it more trouble than it's worth putting this down on my health forms? I'd also appreciate if anyone could share experiences with mental health services at Rice."

Why you should be a math major.,https://www.reddit.com/r/riceuniversity/comments/12k6cky/why_you_should_be_a_math_major/,32,30,2023-04-13 01:00:22,"Mathematics is a fascinating and beautiful subject that has the power to unlock some of the biggest mysteries of the universe. When you study math, you explore the underlying principles and patterns that govern everything around us, from the tiniest subatomic particles to the most significant structures in the universe. Everything is a generalization and can be studied in this field.

As a math major, you will develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and techniques that can be applied to various real-world problems, from designing efficient algorithms to modeling complex systems in science and engineering. You will learn to think logically and critically, analyze problems and break them down into smaller, more manageable pieces, and communicate your ideas effectively to others.

But studying math is about more than just practical applications. It is also about exploring the beauty and elegance of pure mathematics, where the focus is on understanding mathematical structures and the relationships between them. When you study pure math, you will encounter some of the most beautiful and profound ideas in human history, from the elegant simplicity of Euclidean geometry to the mind-bending complexity of abstract algebra and topology.

Mathematics is a subject that rewards curiosity, creativity, and perseverance. It can be very challenging at times (you notice you will become a masochist), but the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from solving a complex problem or proving a theorem is genuinely exhilarating. Whether you aspire to become a mathematician, a scientist, an engineer, a computer programmer, or anything else, studying math can help you develop the skills and mindset needed to succeed in any field.

I genuinely believe that to grasp the world's beauty and how topics connect (a sorta-universal theory kinda thing), you need to study math. While Rice may not be the best school for Math, it makes it up with its tiny math classes (especially if you take honors). After the introductory courses, you will find yourself joining a small and friendly community.

In summary, being a math major at Rice is a fascinating and rewarding journey that can lead to a deeper understanding of the world around us, practical problem-solving skills, and a greater appreciation for the beauty of mathematics."
Predatory Fresh Prints “internship” scam,https://www.reddit.com/r/riceuniversity/comments/11o258b/predatory_fresh_prints_internship_scam/,43,3,2023-03-10 21:58:02,"It’s that time of year again when Fresh Prints campus apparel company starts recruiting their next batch of “Campus Managers.” Don’t fall for the scam. 

Here are just a few of their misleading claims: 

**“The average Campus Managers earn $8K a school year. Top CMs earn $40K+.”**

*Reality: Mean, median, mode. With 250 campus managers, that could mean the top 10% make $40k, the next 15% make $25k, and the vast majority earn $270. Ask them how much the median CM earns? Or how many CM’s are within one or two standard deviations of the $8k mean?*

**“We cover all of the costs involved in training you.”**

*Reality: Training is unpaid.*

**“Gain entrepreneurial experience.”**

*Reality: An entrepreneur develops/patents a product, forms a business around it, secures investment, hires & fires employees, and is in control of setting the prices and sales territories. Campus Managers do none of those things. This job is like to being a Sales Rep where you sell $x and are paid a % of $x. However, legitimate sales reps usually have exclusive territories or industries, so that reps are not competing with each other. That’s not the case here. You’re competing with multiple other Campus Managers, sometimes in your own organization.*

*You are not running a business, you are not getting entrepreneurial experience. You “manage” nothing.*

**Don’t fall for it.**"
