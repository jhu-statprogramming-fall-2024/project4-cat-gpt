Flairs: What are they good for? (A Mod's Assessment of the Community's Desire for Post Flairs),https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1g8uni3/flairs_what_are_they_good_for_a_mods_assessment/,4,10,2024-10-21 16:57:52,"Hi, all. I'll cut right to the chase. In an effort to keep this community organized, and to help people find what they're looking for more easily (or get rid of the stuff they don't want to see), I'd like to know what r/Cornell thinks about introducing a post flair system to the subreddit.

Pros:

* Easier navigation. If you want to see memes, you can filter by the applicable flair. If you don't want to see campus news, you can ignore those posts either unofficially or by filtering them out.
* Easier moderation: As you've guessed, some categories of posts are harder to moderate than others. Politics, vague admissions posts, updated campus policies...categorizing posts by content type will make it easier for the mod team to take quicker action.

Cons

* Potential reduction in volume of posts submitted. Some people don't want to be boxed in by a post flair, and I get it. Additionally, if there's a single barrier to submitting a post (even one as simple as a message reminding you to add a flair or face post deletion), some users will naturally not submit what they were originally planning on sharing with the community.

I'll add a comment below where you can reply with your opinions on what the flairs should be. As always, feel free to expand on your opinions in the comments section.

Cornellians Appointed to Trump Administration Roles,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1gvrbdt/cornellians_appointed_to_trump_administration/,148,18,2024-11-20 14:55:46,"*The Cornell Review -* [*thecornellreview.org*](http://thecornellreview.org)

Three notable Cornellians have been tapped for prominent roles in the Trump administration, stirring excitement—and a few raised eyebrows—among the university's alumni community. Nicholas Vader, Pablo Pandey, and Enzo Stromboli, each bringing distinct backgrounds to their new positions, are set to make waves in the political landscape.

**Nicholas Vader: Leading the ATF**

Nicholas Vader, an alumnus with a history at the National Rifle Association (NRA), has been appointed to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Known for his outspoken support of the Second Amendment, Vader’s nomination has been met with both support and skepticism. As a former advocate for the NRA, he’s expected to bring a pro-gun rights stance to the ATF, a move that could shift the bureau's regulatory approach.

In his typically colorful fashion, Vader promised that his tenure would be a ""banging success,"" a remark that encapsulates his bold, unapologetic style. Supporters see his background as an asset, hoping he will streamline the agency’s operations and bring clarity to its policies. Critics, however, worry that his close ties to the NRA could tilt the ATF's mission too heavily in favor of deregulation, sparking potential conflicts over gun control efforts.

**Pablo Pandey: Ambassador to India**

In a high-profile diplomatic appointment, Pablo Pandey, a Cornellian of Indian descent, has been named the U.S. Ambassador to India. His experience in international relations and trade is expected to serve him well in this crucial post, particularly at a time when U.S.-India relations are increasingly significant on the global stage.

However, Pandey was unavailable for comment when recently spotted at Sangam’s lunch buffet, where he was reportedly enjoying a hearty serving of biryani. Witnesses say he waved politely to the press, but with his mouth full, he declined to issue any statements. Whether or not Pandey’s appetite for diplomacy matches his appetite for Indian cuisine, he’s expected to navigate the complexities of U.S.-India relations with skill.

**Enzo Stromboli: Title IX Coordinator**

Perhaps the most surprising appointment is that of Enzo Stromboli, founder of the Italian-American Anti-Defamation League, as the new Title IX Coordinator. Known for his advocacy work against stereotypes, Stromboli has promised to bring a ""hands-on approach"" to enforcing Title IX regulations, which address gender discrimination in education.

While his enthusiasm for the role is evident, some have questioned whether Stromboli’s background in cultural advocacy aligns with the responsibilities of overseeing sexual misconduct cases and gender equality enforcement. His statement that he was ""touched by this honor"" raised a few eyebrows, particularly given the sensitive nature of Title IX enforcement. His press conference attire—a t-shirt emblazoned with the number 69—also became a talking point, though Stromboli laughed off the incident, attributing the shirt to a playful gift from a Canadian ex-lover.

**The Cornellian Legacy in Washington**

With these appointments, Cornellians continue to make their mark on American governance. Each of these alumni brings unique perspectives, although their distinct paths have left some wondering about the future of their respective agencies and offices. Whether these three will elevate the conversation—or simply shake things up—remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: their ties to Cornell will ensure that the Big Red spirit continues to ripple through the corridors of power."

Cornell Curve Fallacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1gv34kz/cornell_curve_fallacy/,99,35,2024-11-19 17:46:30,"So I transferred from a middle tier college to Cornell my sophomore year. Had a 4.0 before that, just studied course material. Now I average around a 3.6, so not to bad, but not excellent. However, I do feel I’ve learned more at my previous college. Now that I’m a senior, I feel like I haven’t learned much at Cornell. 

I understand why the whole curve system (gets you a better representation of how people deal with more in depth course material, better range idea of how the class is doing,…) but honestly, it’s incentivize students to learn how to test instead of course material. I got an A in econometrics (arguably one of the harder econ classes) not knowing what a regression is. I can skim through the different parameters, results, math, but honestly, don’t know how I would do it without a program running the regression for me.

I’m not blaming the school, the program, the major. It’s on me for sure. But I do believe there’s an incentive to learn how to test rather than the material here, which is kinda sad.
Love to get your thoughts on this, if it’s a me thing or a common phenomenon.

Ps, this probably applies to more stem/dyson oriented students (no offense intended to literary and artsy people)"

I take pride in my job, and as the hated community parking ticket enforcer, I am used to dealing with my fair share of Double Parking, Parking in a Handicap Space Without a Permit, Over the Line, Blocking Driveways, Wrong Way Parking, Parking on the Sidewalk, Parking Without Payment, Paying Without Parking, and Terrible Parking in Handicap Spot with Non-Arm Impairement. But never, ever could I have been prepared for what happened next. On what seemed like a regular Tuesday, I went to get my skibidy big Mac toilet but I was impeded by something. ""Oh my gyatt"" I said to myself, ""it can't be true."" Parking me in was none other than... the white whale..a scofflaw with over 300 unpaid Cornell Parking Tickets, at this point. Finally I had to chance to catch them, the nemesis that got me into this line of work 26 years ago. I jumped out of the car and ran over to the assman, ""stop u/fast_assman!"" I said while spitting, ""Pay your parking phines, purchase a permit, or perish!!"" I was about to -10000 aura their ass until at the last second they started gooning like they're only in Ohio! I had to 1,2, buckle my shoe (new Thomas Jefferson 76's ""sheee, auuuh""). As they reversed, they must have got hit with the 360 no scope which gave me enough time to run over and try to arrest them. However, I couldn't have imagined their power. The assman had been secretly edging this whole time and hitting the griddy like some goofy ahh baby gronk. In lightning speed, I had   transformed into the sussy imposter channeling my inner gigachad like fweddie fawsbeaer. In the final moments of our battle, I became more zesty than Andrew tate, determined to not let the assman slip through my Dennis fingers. I was just about to issue my citation when they asked ""what the sigma?"" And revealed their final form, as the rizzler! I yelled for Mr beast to save me but it was too late.. I collapsed on my gyatt looking like I just finished an Alabama mewing streak. They looked at me and said ""quandale dingle kid named finger I love zingers fanum tax"" before speeding away. 

And that, kids, is how I got rizzled by the assman."

I graduated in 2023 ( CS from India, IIT if anyone knows), with 8.5GPA, top 5% of my class \~ 120 people. I have 5 publications - all during undergrad, 2 in CS ( one CVPR ), rest in different field ( Quantum Physics). I have 1.5 yr work-ex as a research engineer in deep-tech startup here in india.

I'm thinking of applying to MS, because I'm not 100% sure what to do next. I am also primarily applying to move to the US and also get a strong network.

I am not sure if i'll do a PhD after this. Btw i am also considering if an MBA post this degree (but after a 2yr MS might not go there). Funding is probably a constraint and would love some scholarship.

I am inclined to start a startup as well, also considering consulting / quant-finance gigs post this.

I know it's super-haphazard, but would love some advice. Thanks!

in reference to students who wanted a day off from class in light of the week of tragedies on our campus, you called them, AND I QUOTE, ""fucking lazy and stupid."" do you have no empathy at all? sure, there is a non-zero possibility that there are a small minority of students who, like you, have zero empathy and want any excuse for no classes (though I doubt it, because people who don't want to go to class *that* much, just don't go to class). but to call **every student who wants a break** in light of actual gang rape, literal deaths, and a murder, **lazy and stupid** is incredibly heartless. you also said (and this is a quote), ""just because someone killed themselves doesn't mean i want a break. i'm fine."" GOOD FOR YOU. not everyone is like that, especially on a campus that is KNOWN for being depressing. just because YOU may not resonate with feelings of suicide or the repercussions of SA, does not mean other people are lazy for wanting A DAY of rest. if you're already feeling suicidal or have experienced abuse or sa, seeing it all happen so close to home can be traumatic. i'm happy you've never had to experience these things, but it doesn't take a genius to understand the concept of empathy and that, maybe, living right next door to a home of gang rapists is discomforting and potentially a requisite of a day of rest.

you mentioned you were in an ILR class. you also speak as though you did high school debate, so i am going to make the presumption you are in ILR. i'm also going to make the presumption that you believe you are very intelligent (which i'm not doubting) because you were talking up your final paper topic to your friend (whose hot lunch passes you've been using for weeks, while they have to eat cold wraps). people like you, who are so cruel and in politics, genuinely terrify me. when i see people graduate from elite universities and get elected into office with the most heartless policies (like hm JD vance), i genuinely am confused. and now i've met someone like that in the flesh. i hope you never become a lawyer or get elected into any type of office before you learn how to be considerate and thoughtful of other people. it doesn't matter how good your grades are if you have no heart for anyone except yourself. truly if this is just who you are, please reconsider you area of study, as i do not think you're understanding any of it.

Does this imply that there are now greater opportunities for master's students from this university to transition into a PhD? Secondly, if admitted, can the PhD credits earned during the master's program be transferred, potentially shortening the duration of the PhD? I am also curious about the typical time it takes for someone who has already obtained a master's degree to complete a PhD. Lastly, what is the approximate stipend level for PhD students? Would it be higher for those in the Computer Science department?

As the title said, my (now ex) boyfriend tried to have sex with me without my consent. The incident happened last weekend, when I was in his apartment. I tried to tell him to stop because I didn’t feel safe enough to have penetration sex with him on that day, but he ignored it and kept pinning me down on his bed. I tried to fight back, but he was a lot bigger than me so I could do nothing. After 4 or 5 times of yelling stop to him, literally begging him, he stopped, and got annoyed at me because I didn’t let him in. I broke up with him afterwards, and also I was truly hurt from that. I wonder, if I, a non-Cornell student, should go to Cornell Title IX coordinator for this? I had emailed them and also Title IX coordinator at my school, and quite frankly Cornell Title IX coordinator replied to me quite generic. They did tell me I can request them to investigate it, but I’m not sure if it’s gonna help me or not, and they also offer to have a meeting with me. I live 5 hours away from Ithaca so it will be quite troublesome for me to travel there, so again, I don’t know if anybody has any experience like this before, is it worth it to ask them to investigate it?

Sorry if I make any unclear sentences or questions in this post, I feel like my mind is a mess right now whenever I have to talk about this matter, and honestly I do not want it to just slip away like nothing. He did me wrong, and he is also an influential guy in one of the societies I know (outside of Cornell), so I also want to talk about it publicly to raise awareness to people I care about, but it’s quite hard for me to navigate around this mess.

I am a Cornell CS junior. I can include all basic furniture (bed frame, mattress, office chair, floor lamp, desk, sofa, coffee table, microwave, air fryer, bedside table, shoe rack, and two monitors).

💰 Price: 13xx, includes internet but not utilities. As I'm eager to rent it out, the price is negotiable.

🏠 Apartment Details: 810 sq ft. Large windows with downtown/sunset views. South-facing, with plenty of daylight in both bedrooms all day. My room has good lighting with two windows. All three bedrooms and the living room have individual AC and heating, and the living room has heating as well. The kitchen is equipped with a fridge, oven, stove, dishwasher, etc. The living room and bedrooms are spacious and ready for you to move in.

🏢 Building Amenities: The apartment includes a 24-hour gym, study room, laundry, vending machine, and even a private cinema! There's a monitored mailroom, so no worries about package theft.

🚗 Transportation: Less than a 10-minute walk to campus (Goldwin Smith, Uris Hall, Gates Hall). There’s a bus stop right downstairs, making it easy to get to campus or downtown.

🍞 Surroundings: Very convenient access to restaurants—within 50 meters of Fusia, Koko, Chuan Yue Lou, 7-11, and about 100 meters to the Asian snack store, Ninja Chicken, and Gangnam Station. Greenstar is nearby for groceries, and there’s a sushi food truck right downstairs.

👨 Roommates: Two male CS juniors. If you’re also studying engineering, you’ll enjoy discussing academics and career opportunities with them.

FAQ: Can I rent only for the spring or summer? Of course! Feel free to inquire."

I know these might be small things, but these are some things I am grateful for in these difficult moments, feel free to reflect on what you are grateful for, it might make you feel a little bit better 

- clean and fresh air to breathe and clean and fresh water to drink
- seeing the people that I love and have lost in my dreams
- hot, strong coffee
- seeing the stars on clear nights
- tea with honey
- a warm, safe place to live
- being able to give back to the community by volunteering 

these might all seem like basic things, but they are things I am incredibly grateful for, and things I still have even when times are hard. All of us here have something we’re grateful for, even if we find we’re lacking motivation to get up in the morning or feel that there is nothing to look forward to in life. I promise you you will feel better if you get up and do something. I highly recommend doing something outside of yourself, whether that be volunteering, listening to a friend, taking care of an animal, immersing yourself in a good book, etc.

Is it still possible to switch out, and how hard would getting a single be at this point? 

I definitely know I should’ve considered all these things when selecting a double because we literally chose each other so I don’t know why all her habits changed once we got here but I’m struggling a lot. Aside from the fact that she and my suite mates constantly exclude me I don’t think we’re a good lifestyle fit and I’d love to be out of here as soon as I can.

Update to Previous Post Regarding Frat SA Case,https://i.redd.it/t5aa5ebu0wzd1.jpeg,10,7,2024-11-09 14:39:06,"Some of y'all are driving me a little crazy on the last post. I admit that I did make an error in saying that Lambda Chi Alpha was ""almost definitely"" the frat involved in this incident–while acknowledging the possibility that I was missing some information that didn't show up in my Google search. But some people took that and ran with it, saying that I was trying to spread rumors and ""refusing"" to edit a post that I quite literally did not have the option not edit. And it’s occurred to me now that for whatever reason, some of you thought I was lying when I said I couldn’t edit it…? So here’s your screenshot, too. Anyway, we clarified through discussion in the comments that it was, in fact, Chi Phi. For anyone who couldn't have looked in the (not very many) comments to figure that out, here you go.

Original Post:
""First off, if any of the so-called men who participated in this or even knew about it and did nothing happen to be here, you’re disgusting and sick. Second, I don’t know why the university bothers to be even slightly vague about which fraternity this was. A quick Google search tells me it was almost definitely Lambda Chi Alpha, unless there’s another frat on the same block I’m not aware of. There’s no use protecting their image. Third, immediate, temporary suspension is a start, but I really hope they take this seriously until they determine each and every individual involved and get them expelled and arrested.
I’m just sickened by the number of emails like this I’ve gotten since I enrolled here. Boys, hold other guys accountable and don’t turn a blind eye when they’re being complete idiots. Even if it means you’re the one “lame” guy at the party, you could be the one who saves a fellow student—a fellow human being—from a lifetime of trauma or an early death. And ladies, ALWAYS have some form of protection on you, especially when walking alone, at night, at parties, or anytime you’re alone with a man/men (even if you think they’re your friends). Some of these guys think it’s open season on women, so make sure you can fight back. Give them something to make them think twice next time."""

We have a dog that is an old boy and has developed neuropathy and arthritis (possibly DM, but obvi don’t know for sure). He is incontinent of stool about 1x/day and occasionally (25% of the time) has pee accidents.

Do undergrad students in the area who plan to become vets and/or students in the vet school pet sit at all? People keep telling me that it is a great place for dog sitters because of vet school students. I am looking for someone who would be able to check on him + let him out 3x/ week on the days I’m working between 11-4PM (sitters choice what time, minimum 30 min, preferred 1hr with him).

The sitter would need to be willing to clean him up from poo accidents with our hose if he had one while I’m at my 12hr shifts. I would leave blankets and supplies out to just switch out any soiled ones but wash any rugs/ etc. myself. We do diapers at night but I try to avoid them during the day. Also would need whoever it was to give him 1x pill (mid-day pain med).

What is a reasonable $$$ offer for this? Do students even have schedules that would make this possible/ where would you go to find a sitter with these skills? Is charging a certain amount for 30 min / 1 hr depending on what they can do that day, with a bonus for any accidents an appropriate way to budget it?

We have had dog sitters but more neighbor helping neighbor pet friends scenarios vs. hiring someone to help w/ a geriatric dog and clean up poop accidents.

I’m wondering. Do people genuinely at least try to understand the other side?,https://i.redd.it/11o1k7ei7czd1.jpeg,0,20,2024-11-06 20:00:51,"    I keep seeing this very bad engagement with arguments that is question begging. If someone believes that ending the life of the fetus is a great harm, or that the fetus is a person, do you know how morally bad 800,000 deaths a year is? But, I’ve seen no one give an account of why the fetus doesn’t have moral value. (Like Kate Greasley or McMahan do), or argue that bodily rights are enough to justify abortion (Like Thomson, and Boonin give). No attempt to understand positions like Don marquis “Future like Ours” argument, or Perry Hendricks “impairment argument”, or Personal identity cases for the impermissibility of abortion. Just people begging the question, that the fetus isn’t a person deserving of moral consideration, and calling other people evil without engaging in any literature. Finally, every state with restricted abortion access has a medical exception. Why is the burden always on pro-life legislators, and never on doctors to follow the law correctly? If the doctors are waiting, and they know the persons life is at great risk as in this case this seems like an instance of medical malpractice. And even if we admitted the laws were flawed, this would just mean we need more specific guidelines for when abortion is permissible. I think all of this just highlights how bad people’s engagement is with philosophy in general. If you’re so passionate about a topic, read on it"

I'm currently in CAS as a Freshman, and I'm planning to apply to transfer to Nolan this spring. Because of this, I don't plan to take any classes in my major right now, and will just do classes towards my minor, as well as distribution requirements and the hotel DE&I courses. Additionally, I am taking financial accounting, but cannot take any other Hotel School Courses as they are limited to Nolan. My question is, is this fine, or is it better to take some classes towards my major right now? 

Additionally, if anyone has suggestions on what classes to take to better angle myself for the transfer, I would appreciate it. 
Thanks"

Making Friends and Memories as a Senior,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1gjhoia/making_friends_and_memories_as_a_senior/,9,2,2024-11-04 15:58:51,"I know we get a lot of posts about being lonely or sad at Cornell, but I've been having a really tough time these past few weeks with trying to meet and make a nice group of friends in my final year of school, and don't really know where else to turn :(. Especially as a queer individual, it seems hard to find a group I can be completely comfortable with, and its' been really weighing on my mental.

I was a transfer student, and also took a year leave in my sophomore year and the majority of my friend group ended up a year ahead of me, so now that I'm a senior, 99% of the people I used to hang out with are all gone, and the ones that are left seem too sedentary to go out and do things, no matter how much I try to push them. At this point, its' been so long since I had to go out and socialize that I am frankly completely unsure of where to even meet/find a friend group to join this late into my college career, now that the old avenues of ""just knocking on your neighbors door"" and ""being in all the same intro classes with people"" aren't really options anymore. I'm in a few clubs right now, but most of the people in them fall into the category of not wanting to go out/not really being the social types. 

At this point, I'm not really sure where to go; I've been going out a bit more this semester to parties and events and things and have been having an absolute blast, but don't really have a solid group of friends I can do so consistently with, and its' really been depressing me that this part of my life is just about over. It seems like the majority of friend groups at this point in college are pretty insular and hard to break into, so I'm not sure how to even go about trying to get involved or meet new entire groups the same way I would in my freshman year. Would love advice for finding anywhere I can meet other friendly people who might be looking for more people to hang out and actively do things with, especially if the people within these spaces tend to lean more towards being queer.

Any absolute beginners interested in taking self-paced Russian next semester (RUSSA 1132)? We only need 2 more people for the section to be taught!

Here's details from the [Russian language website](https://russian.cornell.edu/index.cfm?MainFrameURL=syllabus&CourseID=RUSSA1131-1132&Section=currentclasses&LinkID=RUSSA1131-1132#Week_10):

Russian 1131-1132 is a **TBA** (Time to Be Arranged) course. The class days/times are chosen at the **organizational meeting**. We always try to accommodate everyone. The time and place of the organizational meeting are announced on our Welcome page, see the navigation bar on the left.

At the beginning of the semester, we find out from each group of students how hard they want to work, i.e. how fast they want to move through the material.

The pace you select is measured in credit hours. This year, Russian 1131 in the fall can be taken for 2 or 3 credits per semester. (Compared to the 4 or 5 credits in 1121.) The same is true of Russian 1132 in the spring this year (2 or 3 credits vs. 4 or 5 credits in 1122.) In some years, the number of sections we can teach depends on our teaching resources and the level of interest among the students.

The 2-credit section meets 4 times a week for 30 minutes each time. The 3-credit section meets 4 times a week, for 40 minutes each time.

If you use Russian 1131 and 1132 to fulfill your foreign language requirement, you need to accumulate at least 11 credit hours in all RUSSA courses combined. This can be achieved in two or three semesters by taking Russian 1103/1104 (2 credits each) at the same time as 1131/1132 or taking 1125/2203 after 1132. See ""Language requirement"" under Courses in the navigation bar on the left. To fulfill your Russian minor requirements, you need to complete RUSSA 2204, no matter what route you take to get to it."

I received the Cornell transfer option and it’s my dream school so I’ve been incredibly grateful for the chance to attend. I have all the requirements as of now and will strive to maintain a high GPA through the school year. However, I recently was involved in an issue that has caused me to receive a conduct violation as there was a bottle of alcohol found in my dorm room. Because I’m studying abroad, I am of legal age for alcohol possession, though the conduct policy states we are not allowed to have alcohol in our rooms. 

I’ve been told it’s not serious because it is my first offense. However, the transfer option guidelines state that I must remain in good disciplinary standing. I believe that it will not show up in my records as an offense, but as a simple warning. Technically, Cornell will not be aware of it unless they are actively searching for it in my records. Still, I am very worried that this will jeopardize my chances of attending Cornell next year. 

Is there any way I should go about addressing the issue? Should I contact Cornell beforehand or hope that they won’t use it against me?"

Seriously where can I masturbate???,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1gfry6u/seriously_where_can_i_masturbate/,0,5,2024-10-30 17:20:44,"I am a freshman in Cornell dorms and one of my roommates is an international student who just skips class and plays League of Legends in our room for a literal minimum of 16 hours a day. He even gets his groceries delivered and eats all his meals at his desk so he literally never leaves the room for more than like 5 minutes(10 minutes if he decides to shower that day). Aside from my room, the only other place that I thought I could masturbate in is the shared bathrooms, but nutting on the public shower floor just seems so disgusting and heinous. It's been like 3 weeks at this point and I can literally feel a pressure inside my pubic region whenever I sit down. Does anyone know a place I can go to masturbate? Seriously."

I love Halloween and all I’ve ever wanted was a group of friends to go out with. This was supposed to be my first and last Halloweekend and I was so excited, but once again I wasn’t enough for a group of people.

I do have a boyfriend here who is really supportive, but I wanted friends too. I’m too poor for the rich kids here, I try to do well and school, and I didn’t party till this year because I was scared of getting caught with a fake and not being able to go into my job. (Yes I know it’s “not that deep” but it was to me.) I have been in 16 different clubs since being at Cornell, and I’ve never been close with anyone here. I have three close friends who don’t live here so I know it’s not that I’m not a good person I’m just sad. 

I had my only long term friend here ghost me after getting a boyfriend, and the friend group I was with has apparently been very hostile towards me when I’m not there. 

This was my dream to go here, but I feel like the lack of community killed me and mad my mh issues worse. No it’s not seasonal depression I live way farther north than this and I love the snow!

After freshman year, everybody basically has their preset friend groups, but that’s not for lack of me trying. I cook dinner for people I invite everybody out. I wanna do exciting things instead of just drinking, but I always get forgotten. I’m just really tired of it here. I was in a sorority and left because I was paying people to be friends with me and they were treating me like shit. There was just never a community for me here."

They would literally pull you from across the street, act aggressively, over-the-top nice, and talk fast so you’re distracted by their niceness and don’t really know what’s happening. They didn’t really explain a whole lot about the organization and don’t leave room for questions. They hand you a pamphlet with donation plans for a LOT of money (hundreds of dollars from college students). If you say no to that much they knock it down for you until it’s reasonable, but they very much guilt-trip you the whole way through.

Most importantly, they take your personal and credit card info, and breeze through the consent forms without you reading them (THEY are the ones checking the boxes on THEIR phone, not you). They also never mentioned they were a Christian mission group, if that matters to you. They have very little info online if you look that up, the only thing I’ve seen about them is ppl suspicious of it being a scam. Their HQ address seemed sus on Google maps, a very plain no-named building.

TL;DR: Scam charity. Refunds are easy and quick if you contact them through their website (same day for me), don’t need much of a reason either. Donate to real charities you know and not from ppl on the streets preying on gullible college students."

To Fellow Cornell Faculty: Don't Enroll in DailyPay/Wisely-It's Shady & Also Payroll is a Nightmare,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1gb8esl/to_fellow_cornell_faculty_dont_enroll_in/,57,30,2024-10-24 17:36:02,"I have deleted this enormous post for privacy reasons, but a few things I've learned about payroll after being faculty here for 3 months:

1. If you ever get your paycheck garnished for ""retirement arrears"" or something else that seems odd, investigate. Payroll and retirement made a mistake on my check and took over $900 out when they were supposed to take only $200. HR tried to gaslight me at first. Start with ERS. The rep there literally told me what to say to get HR to listen to me. Once I got some traction with HR, they redirected to HR Retirement, who gave me an apology and my money back. That might be your case as well.

2. Don't enroll DailyPay and Wisely. Cornell endorsed and partnered with a shady company that might lose your money. Check out the reddit posts about Wisely and you will see this is not just me. My entire paycheck disappeared. DailyPay and Wisely told me they never got my money from Cornell and HR Payroll froze me out. They work remotely and the phone number for them has an automated response that says they communicate exclusively via email. They did not respond to a single email when I reported that I did not receive my paycheck. After my Chair and Deans got involved, HR Payroll staff explained that they couldn't respond to me because they *“were directed to cease all communication about DailyPay with employees until further notice.”* If there wasn't a problem with those companies, HR Payroll would not have said that. 

3. HR is not your friend. During both payroll problems, I was told I was mistaken (when I wasn't), it wasn't their job (when it was), it was fixed (when it wasn't), etc. I am usually a ""good faith"" sort of person that assumes good intentions from others, but with HR, you need to operate on negative assumptions. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. Best to find admin in your department. My Chair (god bless them) fought for me and got my paycheck back. They pulled in multiple Deans to make that happen.

I’m scared. I’ve never burned out like this before. I think I’m failing a couple classes which would have been inconceivable a few short months ago. 

The thing is that I’ve been unhappy with academics here for a long time and I’m scared that withdrawing from the semester will just be pushing back all my dissatisfaction with Cornell to be dealt with later— I guess my unspoken fear is that I won’t want to go back, ever, if I give myself a permission to step off the conveyor belt temporarily.

Only I’m already off the conveyor belt, just by accident. I fell behind worse than I’ve ever fallen and it doesn’t feel fixable.

I’m so frustrated with myself. I thought I could push through the drudgery and exhaustion and lack of passion for one more academic year but now I can’t open assignments without crying or shutting down. Is there any, any way I can fix this? If I withdraw for now, how can I convince myself to come back? I want to graduate from here and make the time I’ve invested in getting a degree worth it.

Obviously I will be prepared by then. For context (if it matters) my prelim 1 score ended up better than I expected, landing right on the B+/A- boundary, so my overall course standing (including homework) is fine.

Side note, I really hate this class and find it needlessly time consuming.

i think part of why i felt so conflicted is because deep down i knew it was something worth exploring again even if it was complicated. looking back i realize that both of us had misunderstandings and didn’t fully grasp each other’s intentions and a lot of our disagreements were not as bad as i thought. the conversation was really difficult but it helped us a lot.

reaching out gave me a lot of clarity and we found that we’re more on the same page than i thought so we’re slowly starting to explore things again it’s not easy but it feels right. i realized life is too short and i just don’t want to live with regrets especially with senior year going by so fast. we all have room for growth and sometimes it just takes a leap of faith to realize it.

thank you for all the support and advice your words have helped me and i truly appreciate it!

How the hell do you meet people in humanities/intellectual circles?

Up until this point I've only been in a few business clubs, a business fraternity, and a business-related current events club and all people talk about are jobs, networking, and parties. I rarely feel engaged in any conversation and it feels so artificial and mundane. Most people I've met just want to go to IB/consulting and get drunk on the weekends, and as a result, aren't very interesting to be around. I've met many people here who haven't read a book for fun since middle school. I was attracted to Cornell in part for the potential to meet people with scholarly ambition and to have interesting intellectual discussions and so far it's been very disappointing.

I do a lot of philosophy, creative writing, history, East Asian studies and linguistics research outside of class. I run a blog on untranslated books, write for literary magazines, and have been writing some humanities research papers for fun. This semester I've joined a lot of the writing and humanities related clubs on campus (as in, like the five that are active) and dropped 2/4 of my business clubs to compensate, but I'm still let down by the amount of humanities and liberal arts people I've met and activities I'm able to do. Not only are nearly all of the humanities-related clubs inactive, the few that are are only 14-25 students from my experience.

Right now I take the bus to Ithaca College three times a week to audit writing, history, and art classes and talk to students there (which I find to be significantly more humanities-inclined and intellectually-minded than Cornellians.) It scratches my humanities itch well enough, but to me it's shocking that a school of Cornell's size and reputation has a student body and classes that are so overwhelmingly pre-professional and intellectually inert, where there's one active writing club but well over 40 business clubs and where Greek life is seen as more important than ancient Greek history. Maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places? Maybe it's because I'm a Dyson major? Sure, there might be small pockets of scholarly-minded students, but the overall je ne sais quoi of intellectual ambition that often gets ascribed to elite universities is notably absent here, from my experience.

I know this might come off as snooty and pretentious, or egotistical and elitist. I deeply apologize if that is the case. I've been sitting on these concerns for an entire year now and couldn't fine any adequate way to word them that wouldn't make it seem this way."

Would this work if I choose to transfer to CALS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1g6v4x4/would_this_work_if_i_choose_to_transfer_to_cals/,5,10,2024-10-18 23:00:40,"Im currently a freshman engineering student pursuing BME with premed, however, I've decided I'd like to internally transfer to CALS to study biological sciences with premed since my current schedule doesn't really work with the programs I am apart of right now.

When I spoke to my advisor, I was told I should at least stay in good standing with my classes next semester for engineering even if I'm trying to transfer to CALS. Since I only have to take math to stay in good standing, can I drop MATH 1910 from this semester to take it next semester instead? I'm at 20 credits right now, and it's not bad but it's very time consuming. If I do this not only will I lighten my load this semester, but I'll only take up to calc II rather than multi when biology only requires calc I. Would I stay in good standing with engineering doing this? Engineering requires up to multi first year so if it's not good standing can I just take a summer course in case internally transferring doesn't work out?

And side question, is it really that hard to internally transfer from engineering to CALS? I've heard horror stories about it and Im a little worried because I'm only transferring out of engineering because it truly does not work with my schedule, and unless I drop one of my programs (which is absolutely last resort for me), then I cant study BME premd specifically."

Feeling kind of dejected cause everyone says this is by far the easiest engineering math ever, and I just feel like I can't do it ( • ᴖ • ｡) On top of that, I'm already struggling with Data Structures and Physics so much, so I was wondering do you guys think It'd be a smart move to drop the class? (I'm also worried what my friends will think, but I know that shouldn't matter...) Like I have no clue if it's this common to drop. I technically wouldn't be behind on the engineering math track either. But at the same time, I know I should push myself, since I *really* haven't been applying myself, like I haven't gone to a single office hour cause I just have no idea what to ask anyways. For Prelim 1, I honestly felt really confident too which was the worst part. I genuinely could answer every question, and even had time to double check, but I still made such egregious mistakes.

He also said the prelim isn't curved, but there's grade cutoffs(?). Not really too sure what that means, but needless to say I don't really think a 53% is a good first exam lol. But basically, TLDR, Should I drop this class this semester and take it again Spring?"

To freshman who hate it here: consider transferring.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1g2lxmy/to_freshman_who_hate_it_here_consider_transferring/,91,55,2024-10-13 09:31:09,"This is probably going to be very controversial, but it's something I've wanted to write for a long time.

Cornell is not for everyone. It *shouldn't* be for everyone, matter of fact. I can't even begin to imagine an university that could cater to every individual taste and perspective and whim and folly that exists on this big blue ball. But Cornell, especially more than other schools, is not for everyone. Part of it is the tough academics, part of it is the environment, part of it is the weather and isolation, and part of it could be summed up to any myraid factor.

I've been seeing a lot of comments here from freshmen who came into campus, either blinded by prestige, lack of research, or unexpected perspectives, and realized that they hate Cornell. I've also seen some of my friends and peers last year who experienced the same.

At this point, you might believe that it's either a you-problem, or that your college experience gets better.

Trust, me it does *not* get better. And it's not your fault. A lot of my peers who hated Cornell but continued on out of a belief that as long as they kept sticking to it, they would eventually come to terms ended up depressed, and in some cases had to leave or withdraw.

But of course, the only way out is to transfer, and transferring seems like a headache. After all, Cornell is a prestigious school, an Ivy League (as much as I hate to use that term), and you have no guarantees that you'll get into a school of a similar caliber. Maybe your parents want you to go to a school as good as Cornell, maybe you have friend groups that exist that you don't want to leave, and maybe you think you'll just get rejected out of the board. It seems like a waste of time and application fees.

Fear not. You're at Cornell. Transferring out, especially for freshman, is very easy. The mere fact that you're in Cornell most likely means your high school ECs and grades were impressive, and as long as you maintain a 3.8+ GPA your first semester, transferring to another Ivy Plus school is not only doable, but very likely. The transfer acceptance rate from Cornell to Columbia, from my experience and the experiences of my peers, is over 30%, which is higher than the internal transfer rate from A&S to Dyson. Of course, besides the #2 school in New York, there's still plenty of other options open to transfers, especially transfers from Cornell. AOs from other schools love Cornell transfers because they're seen as reliable and are proven to be good students, while for a community college or commuter school it can much more hit-or-miss. Personally, I got into 3 other ivies and Northwestern during my freshman transfer year, which I didn't take (something I sort of regret.)

But what if you're a sophomore? It's harder, admittedly, a lot harder, but hope is still not lost. Again, you're at Cornell, and because all colleges outside of HYPSM see Cornell as either a peer or higher-tier school, Cornell students automatically get a massive boost to transfer acceptance rates. I cannot emphasize just how big this boost is. Applying transfer to other ivies from Cornell is like applying freshman year with double legacy. Peer schools that are known to prefer Cornell students and take them even in sopomore year include UPenn, UChicago. Northwestern, Hopkins, Duke, Brown (full pay), and every single public university in the country.

Do I think everyone needs to transfer? No. Cornell is a great institution, one that we should all be proud of, and despite its (many) faults the majority of students here are very happy with it, as indicated by the fact that nearly 60% of alumni will donate back to the university in their lifetime. Cornell's research, especially in agriculture, have literally saved billions of lives via the green revolution and Cornell as whole has done more good for humanity than any other ""elite"" school. And if you want to transfer because you have an inferiority complex and think Cornell isn't ""prestigious"" enough, then I recommend you go to a mental health specialist before you go to a transfer counselor, because you have problems that going to another school won't help.

But for the students that are waiting for Cornell to ""click"" and whose experiences are miserable now: don't wait. Be proactive. Cornell as an institution isn't designed for you, and that is perfectly fine. So take the next step."

Do not live in Aces Apartments,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1g2i1cc/do_not_live_in_aces_apartments/,44,18,2024-10-13 04:43:47,"Inspired by the do not live in Auden Ithaca post haha

I lived on the 2nd floor 6b2b apartment in Aces and would strongly advise against anyone making the same mistake unless you have no other options. Here are the pros and cons from my experience 2 years ago:

Pros
- Location (close to campus and collegetown stores)
- Cheapest rent I could find

Cons
- 3 of the bedrooms had windows facing a wall. Directly beneath the window, the roof of the 1st floor seemed to be covered in rotting leaves and other mysterious substances and hadn’t been cleaned in ages. 
- The bedroom towards the back of the apartment was right next to a piece of very loud equipment from the restaurant underneath Aces. Not sure what the machine was, but it ran 24/7 and would make a very loud whirring noise every few minutes and could be heard clearly through the walls. 
- The bathrooms had mold on the walls. Sometimes there would be no hot water, and when I called maintenance, the guy asked if he could come in the next day because he was already home. Taking an ice cold shower in Ithaca fall/winter is not fun. 
- There were cockroaches in one of the dressers when we moved in. 
- The kitchen sink got clogged, and when our upstairs neighbors used the sink, water started coming up from our sink. We had to manually scoop buckets of water out to prevent the dirty water from flooding the kitchen. 
- Whenever the upstairs neighbors walked it sounded like elephants were stampeding. 
- The heating is uneven throughout the apartment, so one room could be freezing cold while the other is at 85°

Ithaca Renting is unreal for allowing tenants to live under these conditions. I do feel like I trauma bonded with my roommates though, especially when we were dumping buckets of dirty sink water into the toilet. Be forewarned about this apartment!"

Feeling pretty worthless,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1g0tfcg/feeling_pretty_worthless/,56,20,2024-10-10 21:15:04,"I kind of don't have anyone to talk to about this at the moment so I thought maybe posting anonymously here might help me get it off my chest. I have always felt imposter syndrome but over my years at Cornell I have become more and more sure that I am actually quite stupid and worthless. I am definitely not a slacker by nature and I truly tried my hardest to make it work. I tried to get the best grades, join clubs and research, but after 4 years of continuously telling myself ""its okay if you are not as smart you can make it up by working hard"" i am on the verge of giving up. I am so tired of feeling not good enough. I feel like nobody truly gets how hard its been. I am a CS senior and I don't have a job lined up yet. I am also international so I am scared abt whats gonna happen. I was looking into graduate school thinking oh maybe it can be a back up type situation but thats also not working out at the moment. I genuinely do not feel worthy of anything anymore. I have always had that nagging voice at the back of my head telling me I am not good enough but now its like its infront of me, screaming at me, telling me what a waste of space I am. I just feel an insane amount of guilt all day every day, going about my life thinking I am wasting my parents money. I keep waiting for the bad patch to be over but I can't really seem to remember what ""good time"" feels like anymore and I am losing any motivation I had in keep going cause it seems like no matter how hard I try I am just not good enough. I feel like most of friendships here are too superficial for me to actually talk to anyone and I feel like a terrible daughter telling my parents abt stuff since they are already stressed out abt other things. Life currently feels empty and without reason. I just keep getting rejected from everywhere. Jobs. Grad school stuff. I am a very academically focused kid and spent most of my college trying to learn new things and becoming better, but even after all of this why do I constantly feel like the outsider pretending to know whats going on?

CATHERINE COMMONS ITHACA,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1g04pug/catherine_commons_ithaca/,86,22,2024-10-09 23:00:54,"had to make a reddit account to talk about this … the Catherine commons apartment complex in Collegetown is FUCKING TERRIBLE. it’s super expensive, which I thought was fine since it’s close to Cornell and also seems fairly new. Nope.

The biggest issue — UPS doesn’t deliver to here. That means you can’t get mail, you can’t get packages. Their management is telling us they refuse to deliver, but when I called UPS about a package, they said that the APARTMENT refuses to accept deliveries because the workers would have to put them in the mailboxes themselves 🤣🤣. UPS is fine delivering everything but the apartment is too lazy to put mail in boxes. So now we have to go pick up packages and mail from the post office near the airport. They also keep cutting the mailroom hours which makes it super annoying even when packages do get FedEx-ed in.

The gym barely has any equipment — one rack, some dumbbells, and then cardio.

So much glass has already shattered in the building — even the front entrance has had issues with glass. One of our glass panes was literally cardboard. People’s shower doors have shattered.

Their washer/dryer hybrid is shit and an excuse for them to save money by buying one instead of both. I like to run multiple loads of laundry at once. Nope. You have to use the washer, and then it will become a dryer, and if you want it to actually dry properly it can only fit “a couple items” according to the manufacturer. Did I mention that one cycle is 8 hours long?

We were told that there would be a cafe downstairs — it has just begun construction. They keep lying to us about various aspects.

Finally — the management is SHIT. They brought in a new leasing manager because the old ones were getting shit on so hard. They are unhelpful in every way possible and have only now begun setting up a shuttle to the post office for packages after THEY caused the issue (no mail for 2 months! oh joy). Avoid avoid avoid.

The Ithaca renting market is so confusing if you’ve never been here, so don’t get tricked like me and scammed into a place like this. It would be fine if the rent was lower, but some people are paying $3000 a month to live here. Disgusting greedy pigs."

How do you all survive intense burnout? Presuming that you get burnout chronically, which I feel like most Cornellians do— how do you pull yourself out of it when it’s gotten bad?

I feel like the consistently hardest thing about Cornell isn’t the content of classes but their speed— I constantly feel like I could \*make it\* if I just had more time. I was doing ok this semester— then I got sick with some noncovid viral thing and got behind in all my classes— I’m still physically exhausted but it’s been almost two weeks and I really can’t use it as an excuse anymore. I think having to push through that sick week and sit for prelims and write papers and skip out on sleep  just pushed me into burnout extra early this semester. 

I am so very tired, and I don’t know how to explain this to professors-- I can't really, because there's nothing ""valid"" to explain. It’s exhausting to the extent of feeling like a physical illness even though I’m sure it’s just mental at this point. I don’t know how I’m going to get this motivation back enough to make it through— I am in senior year for context so maybe that has some added hurdle to it. Anyone else have this kind of burnout when you’re close to the end? i feel so overwhelmed right now that im shutting down and can’t open any of my assignments without panicking :/ this is really weird for me. Any tips would be so helpful right now. "

i’ve been thinking about how i could’ve done things differently and i’ve been wondering if i should reach out again after more time has passed. i’ve tried texting him before but it didn’t really give us the closure i thought it would. part of me thinks maybe meeting up in person would help but at the same time i don’t want to make things harder for either of us. i’m also not totally sure if i’m ready to face that yet.

but i feel like i need to deal with this before i graduate from cornell because it just feels like the right thing to do for me. has anyone else gone through something like this? what helped you get through it? i’d love to hear how other people have handled it. "

the main question i have esp. for those cs majors: 

has the name Cornell has given you job opportunities you would not have gotten if u went to a lower tiered school?

has the connections/ppl at Cornell has given you job opportunities you wouldnt have got at another school? -- also how is the startup life here?

has the academic rigourness of the classes  given you significantly less time to work on projs/study leetcode, etc?

There are fruit flies everywhere, inside and outside the frozen yogurt machines. I didn’t know it was possible for a frozen yogurt machine to dispense dead fruit flies. I once walked in on him “refilling” the machines (and by refilling, I mean dumping buckets of yogurt without gloves, hairnets, or masks while coughing and getting fingers in the yogurt). The inside of the machine is filthy. There are spider webs, stains, chunks of decaying solid matter, and much more. 

Perishable toppings like strawberries, cherries, and raw cookie dough are kept at room temperature in an open lid and is always swarmed by fruit flies. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a single employee use a thermometer to check the temp for those.

I once made a wrong turn into the storage room, and that place is abysmal too. It smells like rotten food, and there’s puddles everywhere because the ceiling is leaking in multiple places. I overheard Jason telling one of his employees (who looked very uncomfortable around him) that they keep inventory in their bathroom too, and that’s why they don’t let customers in there.

He lets kids who are clearly under 21 (like kids who look fresh out of high school wearing orientation tees) buy booze, cones, juuls, and whip-its without IDing them. He also sells “flavored juul pods for cash only.” He knows exactly what he’s doing.

Max # of credits taken for research?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1fwk8ra/max_of_credits_taken_for_research/,2,3,2024-10-05 06:34:05,"Not sure if this has been asked before, but what's the number of maximum possible credits you can get for doing research? (I know this probably varies based on how much time you have, how busy you are, how many credits you're already taking, what kind of research you're doing, which department your lab is under, etc.) 

I've done work as an undergrad research assistant for 1 credit (I think the maximum number they could give us was at least 3, but I didn't have enough time to put that many hours into this while also having a full courseload of classes). I'm doing research on the side now (so not currently receiving credit or pay), but I think the prof said that I could ask for credit if needed (pretty sure he'd just need to send an email or two to make it happen, but I could be wrong). 

So, I was wondering, **what might be a good number to ask for?** 

I was thinking maybe 3-4 credits, but I'm not really sure if there's a standard for how many credits you're allowed to grant to student researchers. (Hypothetically speaking, I might be able to ask for 10+ credits for being part of this research group, and he might actually say yes as long as I can justify why and then follow through.) 

Side note: I feel like the amount of work any one person has to do to earn 1 credit for research could be different for any other person. Also, it's weird because I feel like I don't have much going on right now since I'm not a full time student, but I also don't want to overwork myself for no reason (let's just say that Cornell's reputation for being the ""most depressed Ivy"" isn't super reassuring). That's why I wanted to get other people's opinions on this. 

P.S.: For context, the research group is pretty new and consists of mostly PhD students and like 2 undergrads. It's kind of under the info sci department but not everyone in it is doing an info sci degree (some are minoring in it), so I guess it's cross-disciplinary in that way."

Donlon: 5/10

Pros: solid location, unique look, some floors do have that irreplaceable social vibe.
Cons: no ceiling lighting, carpet, communal bathroom, attitude wildly inconsistent across floors.

RBG and McClintock: 9/10

Pros: solid location, incredible amenities, hardwood, ac (kinda), bathroom person ratio.
Cons: dead socially, most people don’t interact with their pod mates from what I’ve seen.

Hu Shi : 8/10

Same as RBG and McClintock but worse location.

Low Rises (idk about the program ones, only 6 & 7) : 6/10

Pros: fully renovated interior (both rooms and lounges), huge rooms with hardwood, community amongst suite mates (although weaker now imo with how nice they made the rooms).

Cons: horrible location, essentially no amenities, confusing layout, no elevator can make it tough for those on top floor.

Jameson: 5.5/10

Pros: sky lounge has best views on campus, solid location.
Cons: bug issues? Brick interior very off putting. Same suite style as low rises but without renovation/refurbish.

HR5: 5/10

Same as Jameson but slightly worse location.

CKB and Mews: 7/10

Pros: most beautiful exterior of any dorms on campus imo. Phenomenal location, solid amenities, ac (again, kinda), bathroom person ratio.

Cons: carpet, rooms are tiny with very old furniture. 

Dickson: 4/10

Pros: great location, large rooms, especially singles.

Cons: bro just look at it😭. No ceiling lights, carpet, communal bathroom, no real touch ups since when it was built, which was a very long time ago. Worst dorm on campus imo.

Eco House: 6/10

Pros: Real AC, private bathroom in each room (!!!), solid amenities

Cons: so far away from the other dorms I can barely consider it north campus.

 I'm currently deciding between applying Early Decision to UVA and attending the McIntire School of Commerce or going to Cornell's Nolan Hotel School, with the goal of breaking into investment banking (IB), private equity (PE), or consulting. I’ve also considered Cornell’s Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management, but the acceptance rates are so low that I don’t think it’s realistic for me. 

I have very strong business-oriented extracurriculars, though none of them are hospitality-related, except for being the president of the entrepreneurship club at my school. Eventually, I’m looking to secure job placements in NYC, so that’s a major factor in my decision-making process. 

Given my goals of working in IB, PE, or consulting, I’m trying to figure out which path would give me the best opportunities post-graduation. For those with experience in these fields, which school would you recommend and why? 

Any advice on the strength of alumni networks, recruiting, and career outcomes from either McIntire or Nolan—particularly with a focus on NYC placements—would be super helpful! Thanks in advance!"

Help me with choosing whether to ED to Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1fu1wlb/help_me_with_choosing_whether_to_ed_to_cornell/,0,14,2024-10-01 23:09:17,"This post is kind of a weird combination of a lot of things. I list out what I am looking for a school in general along with some things specific to Cornell that I learned. Then, I talk about the pros/cons that I am feeling in making my decision on whether to ED to Cornell.

I am a competitive candidate -- 1600 SAT, 4.0 GPA, about 20 AP/DE, and pretty solid ECs but nothing insane. (I understand that these schools are super competitive and stats aren't enough, just providing some context)

**Academics/Career Aspirations**

I am planning to major in Computer Science. Academically, my main goal is to have a very strong CS background that will not close off any pathways for me because I'm not sure exactly what tech career I want to do right now. I'll elaborate a little -- I want to have enough experience from my undergrad so that I can explore Big Tech, Startups, and possibly Quant. I am really passionate about startup culture, so I want to go to a place where I can join clubs or other organizations like that and meet people who are smart and passionate about CS.  It's really hard to know what the student body of a school looks like before you enter it so I thought I'd come here and ask people if I'd find what I'm looking for at Cornell based on what I'm looking for.

**Social Scene**

I don't want to attend a place where you have to join a frat and drink all the time to have fun and socialize. I want to be able to have recreational stuff to have fun such as basketball courts, bowling, movie theater, bunch of restaurants. I, at the same time, am not against partying or that culture at all. I just don't want to do that every other day. Also, I heard that rushing frats and stuff is super degrading and I am NOT trying to do that lol. I want to meet people who are not a bunch of Caltech-level geeks but still really smart, and also want to have a social life like me.

**Cornell Specific stuff**

I was told the clubs/project groups are selective and it's super hard to get into those, so that's pretty disappointing to hear since I wanted to take advantage of those in my freshman/sophomore years to get experience to apply for selective tech internships. Please let me know if you know anything about opportunities that CS majors can take advantage of at Cornell.

I did visit the Cornell campus and loved it a lot. My trip got cut short and I wasn't able to explore much of the recreational stuff I mentioned above but I did love the campus's overall vibe. Please let me know if you know anything about the possible activities that people can do around the campus, I'd like to learn more about it.

**Now that I've listed what I am looking for, I will explain the pros/cons that I have so far about EDing to Cornell.**

**Pros**

Great CS program

New huge CS building coming (Cornell Bowers CIS)

People aren't super geeky from what I could tell on my visit

Northeastern weather (I am used to it)

**Cons**

Last year Cornell released a statement saying that they would accept less students during ED from now on. [""In an effort to increase equity in the admissions process, the Faculty Senate discussed the implications of fewer students being admitted in the early decision round going forward at their Oct. 11 meeting."" ](https://cornellsun.com/2023/11/30/cornell-reduces-proportion-of-students-admitted-through-early-decision-track/)

Cornell is not my first option, my options go 1) Stanford 2) Princeton 3) Cornell. These are my top choices based on information I read online. By EDing, I lose my chance to apply to those 2 schools I prefer over Cornell. The problem is, though, I could have a completely different list of top choices depending on where I learn more about. For example, I have never visited Yale or Penn but I might like them more than Cornell if I got to know them more, if that makes sense. All the information I know about them is surface level, based on website info and people on Reddit (lol). By EDing, I remove my chance to apply to a bunch of other schools that I could have ended up liking more than Cornell if I got to know them more.

Clubs/project groups are super exclusive, I really don't like that

**Neither pro nor con**

Comes out to a price that my family is willing to pay, but not cheap by any means but not super expensive"

What does an education at Cornell mean with no future?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1ftnqfz/what_does_an_education_at_cornell_mean_with_no/,0,13,2024-10-01 13:11:31,"Dear Cornell on Fire,

At Cornell’s 2024 graduation, Cornell on Fire dropped a banner depicting a handshake between Big Oil and Big Red. When current Interim President Michael Kotlikoff passed by, we asked him whose side he was on. He replied, “I’m on the side of education.” While one expects no less from the chief academic officer of the University, this answer begs another question: What should education be like?

A bastion of liberal education such as Cornell is expected to embody the view that education should serve the betterment of society. According to philosopher of education John White, “The question: ‘What should our society be like?’ overlaps so much with the question about education that the two cannot sensibly be separated.” A more enlightened take on education — one that resonates strongly with those who believe that a better world is possible and wish to do something about it — has been offered by Judith Suissa, in an essay published in Journal of Philosophy of Education in 2001:

“The question ‘what should society be like’ does not merely ‘overlap with’ questions about education, but is logically prior to all such questions.”

 

In reality, Cornell pays lip service to the ideals of a “better society” while reproducing the power structures and political make-up of the elite society it serves. As such, it embodies an implicit answer to the question “What should society be like?” – namely, that it should be just the way it is: an ecocidal and oppressive system that is driving the world over the brink of climate tipping points in the name of “business as usual.”

A reform of the University is clearly in order. The model of the kind of society it is designed to maintain – and the model of education that this implies – has already been made unsustainable by the presently unfolding and accelerating climate crisis. We no longer have time to ponder abstract questions about societal progress while eschewing or postponing action, because the climate catastrophe endangers the very survival of our species, along with all our dreams of a better world.

Education tops the list of challenges posed by climate change. The “business as usual” mindset (so beloved of Big Oil, the fossil fuel financiers and industrialists, and the politicians and academics who abet them) is the bane of all current grassroots attempts to meet the challenges. It is even more pernicious in education, where a double challenge looms: first, to help the general public realize the scope of the threat and come to the side of immediate climate action, and, second, to prepare the younger generation, not for employment in a world that no longer exists, but for the grand task of shaping a livable future with real (and not just pledged) liberty and justice for all.

At Cornell, commendable efforts to meet these educational challenges are currently underway. These include the work carried out by pioneering individual instructors who have devised new courses on climate change in their disciplines or have “climatized” existing courses; the especially important contributions of the faculty who focus on Indigenous practices of environmental stewardship and on climate justice; the number of First-year Writing Seminars that deal with climate change; the Center for Teaching Innovation’s inclusion of climate change among its topics; the relevant work sponsored by the Einhorn Center for Community Engagement; the Climate Change minor in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences that encompasses a growing number of courses across many disciplines; and the newly convened Climate Change Curriculum Working Group, which includes representatives from all of Cornell’s colleges and schools. Still, Cornell can and must do much, much more.

As always, the path from here to a better future begins with an exercise of the imagination. Since coming together over a year ago, Cornell on Fire has been advocating for a university-wide declaration of climate emergency. Imagine the cascading effects that this action on part of the university leadership would have, specifically on how Cornell’s educational mission is reinterpreted and implemented! Quoting from our list of demands, here is what should be happening next:

•              Cornell must expand climate-related curriculum, establish requirements for climate coursework for all undergraduates, and restructure the disciplines to train students for the future they will actually face.

•              Cornell must incentivize the work society needs scientists to do by changing tenure and promotion structures to value policy design and implementation, climate activism, public communication, and tangible broader impacts.

•              Faculty must speak honestly about the scale of the crisis.

•              Faculty, staff, and students must become engaged in intensive public service to the local region.

•              Climate expertise and climate advocacy must be brought onto Cornell’s Board of Trustees; a Trustees climate change committee must be formed and charged with addressing the existential issue of our time.

It should, but will not, go without saying that these measures on the curriculum front must be accompanied by coordinated action across the board, or the University will fail to practice what it preaches and teaches. Operations, procurement, construction, travel, and all other aspects of the university’s functioning must be retooled with climate justice as the overarching consideration. The Cornell community – students, faculty, and staff – are well prepared for this vital undertaking. The University leadership should recognize this, rise to the challenge of the times — and lead.

To truthful and just education,

I don't mean for FWS, nor do I mean the Knight institute writing workshops. I'm a Dyson major so I don't have a lot of available classes at my disposal (I tried and failed to get into ENGL 2800.) However, I do a lot of short story writing for fun, mostly absentmindedly and to pass the time, and I've always wanted to be a writer. Recently I've been submitting to a bunch of literary magazines as a joke and ended up getting accepted into some of them, so I'm now thinking of abandoning Dyson (which I hate, anyways) altogether and focusing a lot more on a potential writing career since with my current portfolio it's definitely possible. Sadly since I'm a sophomore transferring to Arts is not an option.

I talked to some faculty members and they strongly recommended that I pursue writing, but all of the creative writing seminars are (to my knowledge) locked to MFA students, and all the Ithaca College classes are gone too.

Should I Transfer to Cornell or Stay at My Current School? Need Advice!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1frv5fw/should_i_transfer_to_cornell_or_stay_at_my/,1,19,2024-09-29 03:15:01,"Hi everyone,

I’m a freshman at the University of Colorado Denver and I’m facing a bit of a dilemma, so I’d love some advice from Cornell students! I’m majoring in accounting, and my school has solid job prospects for accounting majors. I’m attending on a full scholarship, so right now my education is completely free.

However, I also have a transfer option to Cornell University for my sophomore year, which is a huge opportunity. The catch is that Cornell would cost me about $75,000 a year for the next three years, which comes out to around $225,000 total. At Cornell, I’d double major in accounting and finance.

Here’s where I’m stuck: I’m considering going to grad school after undergrad, either for an MBA or law school, but I’m not 100% sure which route I’ll take yet. I’m wondering if it would be smarter to stay at CU Denver for free and then aim for a top grad school (like Cornell or another Ivy) for my MBA or law degree. Or, is transferring to Cornell now worth the cost and potential debt for the undergrad experience and connections?

For those of you who are current students or have gone through something similar, what would you do in my situation? Is the Cornell undergrad experience worth it, especially if I’m planning to go to grad school later anyway? Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks so much for your thoughts!"

Cornell emotional rollercoaster and its consequences have been a disaster for my soul.

On hiatus and in a very unfortunate situation that makes me indecisive and miserable. Lucky enough to not need a degree professionally, love my work and have a great time when I’m not thinking about Big Red pit of despair.

Anecdotally I just know campus isn’t safe and I’m not stoic enough to pretend otherwise. Everything from dorms to classrooms, to the protests & counter protests, and more seems compromising to my learning ability.

I’m not a very consistent student but I’ve always been appreciated for my great work ethic when I’m on the clock and getting paid. At Cornell I just don’t feel anything but worse than I did the day before.

If I decide to make a comeback I needed to get my act together yesterday and lock in now. In all honesty I’m unsure if I even value a bachelor’s degree enough to care anymore. Which is ironic considering certain stereotypes about my people. 

I think if I had to face my peers and professors without some redeeming new value add I’d pull a Budd Dwyer on myself"

Question about Cornell colleges,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1fqykgl/question_about_cornell_colleges/,4,12,2024-09-27 21:25:49,"Hello! I plan on applying to Cornell as a first-year student this application season. I've been doing some research about their different colleges, and I had some questions/wanted confirmation about what I've read.

For context, I want to take courses required to fulfill the typical premed track. BUT, I'm not dead-set. I might want to explore a bit.

As far as I've researched, CALS is state-charted (matters for me because I'm from NY) and CAS is not. Premed courses can be taken at both. One main difference is graduation requirements, since CAS requires more humanities and language classes. CALS doesn't have a lot of requirements except a diversity class (Is this correct?)

This is the part I can't find much on. I think(?) CALS requires you to commit to a major from the get-go, while you go into CAS undeclared- is that right? And if I don't want to major in, let's say, biology, it will be harder to find a wider range of courses that will allow me to switch if I go to CALS, but since CAS has a wider range that might be easier.

Also- is it easier to switch majors at CALS, CAS, or is it hard/easy in both? Thank you for your help and I really apologize for bothering everyone on this sub!"

Computer Technician for Hire/Consultation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1fq70oc/computer_technician_for_hireconsultation/,1,0,2024-09-26 21:07:49,"I've run into a problem with my Lenovo gaming laptop - Legion 7 16IAX7, where the laptop cannot turn on.

Because of the nature of the problem, I've purchased a new charger, but it still hasn't fixed the problem. I see online that it might be due to a disconnected battery, but I have no idea how to disassemble a laptop and fix one. 

I wanted to see if anyone would be able to help on campus, before I sent it over to a BestBuy or something where they're going to overcharge the crap out of me for a problem that might not need a tech replacement.

It would be much appreciated if I could receive some help, some compensation would be included if so.

Please contact me at +15165909335, as I'm not always on reddit. Thank you so much!"

Or am I better off doing same room selection (right now I live in dickson)?

Questions as a prospective student @ COE!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1fpqad7/questions_as_a_prospective_student_coe/,0,4,2024-09-26 07:04:29,"Hi everyone! I'm a current HS senior looking to ED to Cornell COE. I had a few questions.

1. I really like the Engineering Physics major @ AEP but I'm worried it'll lock me into a specific niche of engineering, making it problematic for employment. I do not want to go into academia/research and want to break into industry immediately after graduating. Would EP be a stupid choice? or should I apply for MechE. Can I easily switch from EP to MechE if I get in? Does the difference in ABET accreditation pose for problems once i graduate?
2. What are the minors available to a MechE/EP student? I went over the website and most of them just say you can take the minor if 2 or more classes overlap, but that's hard to verify for each minor. I want to major in something econ/business related and the only minor which I know I can definitively do is the Dyson Business minor for Engineers.
3. Is there a startup culture there? I really want to do something ""of my own"" and want to know if there is such an environment available to support me that way.
4. What is the Engineering Co-op program like? Where can it lead me? 
5. If any current/alumni of Cornell COE (or any other college) could answer this, I'd be grateful: ""What is one thing about Cornell you believe a student should know, but wouldn't until they're here at Cornell?""

Thank you to everyone who takes the time to read through and answer even one of these! I'm grateful."

To say it has been quite an uphill battle looking for EMT positions here in ITH is an understatement. I haven't had any success with the volunteer fire departments (PSA for Jrs/Srs: Cayuga Heights FD does not recruit upperclassmen); also submitted my application to Bangs last week after getting turned down last spring (presumably because I indicated I wouldn't be staying in ITH for the summer) and have not heard back ever since about any aspect of my application including the status, timeline, etc, despite a follow up. Given my junior status, CUEMS is without a doubt out of the question (not that I would have gotten in if I wanted to). How does one go about finding EMT gigs in the area?"
Experience with trying to change housing time slot?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1fpfybl/experience_with_trying_to_change_housing_time_slot/,3,5,2024-09-25 21:33:04,"Rising junior, currently in a triple on north, time slot is 6pm on second day for students wanting to change where they live. Time slots are randomly assigned. This is hugely unfair - a student in sub optimal housing should get an earlier slot. It's doubly unfair because rising juniors who were lucky and got early time slots last year and got onto West are now being given the chance to keep their housing. So a student in a triple on North with a bad slot may not get housing at all, when someone in prime west housing can keep their room. Does anyone have experience with getting their timeslot changed?"

Need Help with Abusive Messages from Another Freshman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/1fou54c/need_help_with_abusive_messages_from_another/,64,33,2024-09-25 02:32:18,"Hi everyone, I'm a freshman and I apologize for bringing this question up here. Another freshman has been sending me abusive and threatening messages on webchat after an issue we had at a social event over the weekend. I've tried talking to him, but he won't stop and even says he wants to ruin my life. I feel really threatened over the days, especially since he often says he'll 'find me at lunch' to bring me trouble. Is there anyone I can reach out to for help? This is bullying by definition. Is there a school office taking care of this?

Edit Sept 30: Talked to RA, called him to warn him, blocked him, he shut up. Problem solved. Thanks everyone for help!"
