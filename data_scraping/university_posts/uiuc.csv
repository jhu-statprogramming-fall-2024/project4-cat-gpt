The International Student Advisory Board (ISAB) is a student-led group advocating for the needs of international students at UIUC.

We‚Äôve started a petition to address the challenges many international and out-of-state students face during fall and spring breaks, when dorms and dining close. Without affordable housing or meal options, students staying on campus are left struggling with financial and emotional stress.

There are two of my classmates who I have had tests with in MATH 231 and now MATH 241 that cheat on the exams (all in 231 and all in 241, including final in 231.) I sat next to a group of 3 in 231 that would PASS EACH OTHER THEIR EXAMS in the middle of an exam (big lecture hall when TA's would look away) and write on EACH OTHER'S EXAMS! Now, in 241, I saw one of them leave the exam yesterday and while I am passing him on the street he is flipping through an empty exam I had just finished. The only way this could happen is he was passed the exam at the beginning like everyone else, just instead of turning it in at the end he simply put it in his bag and left. There is a conflict exam for the class on Thursday that everyone can take so my guess is he will just memorize these questions and go into the conflict exam after memorizing the kinds of questions on the exam. There is no way it is marked if a student goes to the original exam, so it is literally like he was not there at all. So, my big question is what do I do in this scenario? I don't know their names, or really anything about them. Any advice?"

The Alma Mater, while a symbol of tradition, is also tied to an era and institutional framework that often excluded marginalized communities and perpetuated inequities. By replacing it with a monument honoring George Floyd, the university would confront its past and take a visible stand against systemic injustice. This act would not erase history but instead reframe it, fostering a campus environment that prioritizes equity, inclusivity, and accountability while inspiring future generations to engage critically with issues of racial justice.

You can stay only during the semester (Jan-April) or the summer break(May-August) or both. The rent is different though, as I will not be using the unit during the summer break.

Bus stop is right in front of the house and the bus will take you about 20 min to go to campus (5-10 min by car). A market is within a walking distance. Parking will be provided with no additional cost. The apartment is located in a quiet, safe, residential area where many families reside.

The roommate will get a bigger room with a built-in closet. The kitchen, bathroom, and living room will be shared. This place is fully furnished with all the electronic appliances and furniture, so you don‚Äôt need to buy a lot. The room has a king-size bed, desk, chair, fan, air-conditioner, heater, drawer, night lantern, mirror, etc. The washer and dryer are outside in the hallway, but only a couple steps away from the front door of the unit.

During weekends and breaks, I am usually out of town, so you get to have ample privacy at home.

I usually keep the space clean and organize household items after use. I am a non-smoker and have no pets and a cleaner in a shared space. And I am looking for someone who is similar to me.

From January to early May

Rent: 430$/month/person(with me)(utilities included)

From mid May to August

Rent: 630$/month/person(without me)(utilities included)

I will send you photos and more details of the house if you message me.

The bedroom includes a full size bed, south facing window, walk in closet, as well as a en-suite bathroom. There is a full kitchen, as well as in unit washer and dryer.

Apartment is available for move in immediately, but will only have to start paying rent in January regardless.

The price on the contract is $1035 per month for just the room along with a $100 covered parking. I am willing to sublease it for $900 per month, with the covered parking for free. Price is completely negotiable within reasonable range. Overall a $2000+ discount. This is the cheapest price available right now. 

I will cover the transfer fee, and when the lease is transferred, I will send you the money past $900 per month in a lump sum.

It is only a 5 minute walk to the engineering quad. And the bus downstairs takes you to union and main quad within 5 minutes.

There‚Äôs a lot of restaurants within walking distance, as well as grocery stores within short driving distance."

We have not lived at 58 E John yet, but we think it's going to be a great apartment! The pictures on the website aren't exactly what it looks like, but we have a video walkthrough of the unit that we can share with you. The bedrooms all look very spacious with large closets. We will all be sharing one full bathroom. There is in-unit laundry. It is about a 15 minute walk to the quad. If you would like a parking space, I know they are $80/month and are first come, first serve.¬†

Rent: **$650**

Internet, water, garbage, power: **\~$100**

Me and Ellie will both be seniors at UIUC next year. We are very kind and relatively quiet lol. Both of us like to cook and watch TV together. Cleanliness is also important to both of us. We both spend a decent amount of time outside the apartment.¬†

Polling places were unable to record votes during that time. Apparently, there were similar problems in the 2022 election. The contractor responsible for maintaining that service is Platinum Technology Resource.

Just a few months ago, we learned Platinum Tech [failed to password-protect](https://www.wired.com/story/illinois-voter-databases-exposed/) their databases, [leaking 4.6 million records including some SSNs associated with Illinois voters](https://capitolnewsillinois.com/news/contractors-unsecured-databases-exposed-sensitive-voter-data-in-over-a-dozen-illinois-counties/). I thought Illinois law [requires business to inform consumers](https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/consumer-protection/for-businesses/data-breach/) about the breach of their data. I didn't get any notice; perhaps there are some caveats?

In your opinion, should the county consider switching away from Platinum Tech? Presumably switching would have a cost but staying with an unreliable contractor also comes with costs. Is this the something that would be discussed by the board or is it the exclusive purview of County Clerk Aaron Ammons? The Champaign County board do not have discussion of the problems with Platinum Tech in [their Nov 21 meeting's agenda](https://www.champaigncountyil.gov/CountyBoard/CB/2024/241121_Meeting/241121Agenda.pdf)."

ratatouille gone rogue,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1gszfqj/ratatouille_gone_rogue/,18,11,2024-11-16 23:01:05,"So, there was a rat in my friend's dorm room. I didn‚Äôt see it myself, but apparently, it crawled through a vent in the closet‚Äîliterally the only way we can figure it got in. Keep in mind, we‚Äôre on the third floor, so this thing must have some next level spiderman ah skills.

From what I‚Äôve been told, it wasn‚Äôt just an average rat; this thing was fist sized. A literal unit. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs gone now, but it‚Äôs been a couple of days, so I guess either it‚Äôs handled or it‚Äôs plotting. I‚Äôm just hoping we don‚Äôt come back from fall break and find its entire extended family throwing some housewarming party on our floor.

This whole situation makes me wonder how easily stuff like this can even get into the dorms. I mean, I‚Äôve already had ladybugs take over my room‚Äîthey‚Äôre straight-up chilling in the lights and blinds at this point. So yeah, a rat making its way in doesn‚Äôt feel like that much of a stretch anymore.

TL; DR: rat crawled into my friend's third-floor dorm, and I already have ladybugs/insects living in my room. Are dorms just open doors for pests now? "

When: 01/01/2025-07/31/2025 (move in date flexible)

FINE DETAILS
I‚Äôm graduating in december and I am going to be moving to another country- so I am looking to leave my kitchen supplies, mattress and frame, and my book shelf. The mattress will be cleaned on mov e out- full size. There is a couch and I‚Äôm probably going to leave my TV. I‚Äôve really loved this apartment so I‚Äôm sad to go but happy to pass the torch! This apartment is owned by a family and is well maintained. The landlords are very communicative and easy going.

The apartment is near champaign public library, right on the green line (east and west) so it‚Äôs a quick ride to campus, but also a scenic walk. Additionally, it is a short walk from downtown champaign and west side park. If you travel on the Amtrak, it‚Äôs a quick walk to illinois terminal. If you have a car, there is street parking and a parking lot out back. (Free!)

This is one bedroom out of two, with a large kitchen, bar, and living room. My roommate is an extremely quiet and respectful PhD student.
The rent is 412.50, and I will cover the internet/water/electricity through august. It will cost 100 dollars to transfer the lease, but I would be eager to split this cost, as it will be a one time cost. Please DM or comment with questions!"

* Windows: seating runs perpendicular to the seating, which makes it hard to look out the windows to zone out as works for me. Some windows had their blinds down and I could not figure out how to open them.
* Seating: There was a lot of seating, however there were ‚Äúzones‚Äù of noise and finding a window seat that was quiet and had the shade up was annoying.¬†
* Comfortability: The chairs were wood which was painful after a while, making me want to go home instead of continuing to work. There are comfy chairs, however they are couch like which is not conducive to good work. Additionally, the lights were a little too bright making it difficult to focus for long periods of time.
* Noise: Pretty quiet as long as you picked a good seat
* Bathrooms: Went to the bathroom on the first floor, and it was really cute. It had colorful tiling and multiple stalls. The stalls were wide enough and had both a hook and flat space on top of the toilet paper to put a watch or a water bottle. Additionally, there was paper to dry your hands.
* Location: Convenient, located on the south quad which is by a lot of my classes so walking over after class is easy.
* Aesthetics: Very nice looking, everything seems new and in working order. There are record shelves that obscure the view of people moving which can be distracting.
* Anything Else: It was hard to find the outlets for the group tables as they were on the side of the wall. Additionally, using the elevator is difficult the first time as there's an elevator to get to the second floor and a separate elevator to access the rest of the floors.¬†

"Green Means Go, Red Means Stop: Another Rant, Yet Again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1gs2diu/green_means_go_red_means_stop_another_rant_yet/,28,25,2024-11-15 17:58:15,"This post goes out to all the drivers in the Champaign-Urbana area:

First off, a *red light* means **stop**. A *stop sig*n means **stop**. A *stop when pedestrian present sign* means **stop**, yes, *when there is a pedestrian present*. Are we understanding how there is a pattern here? People it's not that hard. Don't think the rules don't apply to you. I'm looking especially at you, luxury car owners; from my experience, it's always you guys. Especially at the intersection of 6th St. and John St.. Just because it's a small intersection doesn't mean you get to run that red light.

And holy moly, all you cyclists and electric-scooter riders have to follow the rules of the road too. Y'all can't just go whenever you feel like it.

Too many times have I almost been hit by an ***ignorant swine*** during my time at this university. You'd think people who study here have some common sense, yeah? You think people who have a license to drive a car would actually know how to, yeah? Apparently not...

Call me a cynic, that's fine. Give me grief, that's fine. You have your right to an opinion, and that is ok. But I have a right to mine. But this, in fact, is a matter of law and safety, people. Running a red is *illegal*. Damn. I didn't think I'd even have to say that. I knew this stuff in preschool.

And one last thing: ***we don't care how loud your car is***. I understand it brings many people joy, and that's fine. But understand that most of us just do not care; we don't care what kind of car you drive. Y'all don't have to be annoying thinking that it's impressive--cause it ain't."

How U of I is a test from God and how to overcome Satanic subversion,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1gsywyr/how_u_of_i_is_a_test_from_god_and_how_to_overcome/,0,19,2024-11-16 22:36:08,"I want to make this post to have my fellow students question the doctrine. The totalitarian vibes of this school seem to keep people in a low vibe state and I feel it is my duty to help the not so enlightened become more enlightened. So I realize many will not take this post well and I will probably get attacked for this but the whole point of U of I indoctrination is not too inspire original thought or genuine creativity but rather keep you in a subdued compliant state. Now the Satanic aspect is denying God's creation and stirring up hate for his creations. Teaching you to hate your country and it's origins for being ""racist"" denying the cultural achievements and things that make God's races unique via ""Critical race theory"" is all meant to test you and see who is truly mentally resilient. I guess with this post I encourage students to think for themselves and not fall into the group think mentality. I know many of you desire to fit in amongst your peers and teachers and tricky therapists may not be so encouraging of this free thinking. That is all a test from God and to overcome this low vibe energy I recommend you read the following. Changed my life.

UIUC CS + Math vs Georgia Tech CS (Transfer Spring 2025) for class of 2026,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1gsjtq2/uiuc_cs_math_vs_georgia_tech_cs_transfer_spring/,0,14,2024-11-16 09:31:56,"Hello everyone, I am currently deciding between UIUC CS+Math and Georgia Tech CS. My Goal is hopefully to showcase the pros and cons of the schools in a neutral manner without leaning towards one side. Here are some of my personal preferences:

* I prefer a city setting with cultural diversity, networking opportunities, and a vibrant tech scene
* Being among ambitious students from diverse backgrounds in a rigorous and selective academic environment
* Access to a large tech community with resources for recruiting, research, etc
* I am mostly interested in diving deep into AI and robotics.
* For the academic curriculum, I am more of a theoretical guy but want a blend between practical and theoretical for good preparation no matter what.

**UIUC CS + Math:**  
Pros:

* UIUC has a long-standing history of excellence in computer science and engineering, with earlier developments in research, i want to be a part of that legacy in some way
* Notable track record of successful entrepreneurs, including founders of YouTube, PayPal, Tesla, Firefox, and Oracle. Programs like ZFellows and connections with firms like a16z
* I've always enjoyed both mathematics and computer science so this is not a bad major combo considering I've always had an interest in it
* Offers significant research facilities, including the Research Park, where students collaborate with tech companies and startups.
* The student body is slightly smaller and faculty to student ratio is slightly better (not by much)
* Being in a comprehensive university is useful for meeting people of different backgrounds (i somewhat value a diversified education)

Cons:

* Urbana-Champaign is quieter and may lack the urban environment I'm seeking; Chicago is about 2-3 hours away by train or bus.
* Compared to the Georgia Tech CS curriculum, I am taking approximately 33 credit hours instead of roughly 60 credit hours, meaning it is a lot more difficult to specialize in specific computer science courses like AI, Computer Vision, etc (might have to go to grad school or spend extra time)
* Due to the nature of the CS + Math program, there might be slightly less recognition of the CS degree from some more conservative employers and startups (less specialized than pure cs)
* The overall student quality is more in-state students and less diversity in opinions and selectivity (meaning its harder to find the more ambitious people

**Georgia Tech CS** Pros:

* Being in Atlanta means I have access to a relatively large city for conferences, events, and entertainment, it might be also helpful for the regional network as Atlanta is growing
* Georgia Tech Tech Square is a hub for tech companies and startups, similar to Kendall Square (from MIT) in Cambridge.
* I really like how you can dive into threads (specialization) within cs and be focused on two distinct fields (I can pursue AI and robotics more flexibly)
* In it's own school of computer science (one of the only schools to pull that off
* Pulls very heavy weight with a pretty similar outcome for recruiting in SWE compared to UIUC
* Strong robotics club program (they have RC plane teams, a liquid rocket team, solar cars, etc)
* Institute of Technology (my dream school is MIT so I like the structure of being in an institute of technology)
* Stronger student body in my opinion

Cons:

* I am kinda disappointed to know that their mathematics and physics program is not as strong despite being an institute of technology (where is the S and M in STEM T\_T)
* If I want to pursue research or quant trading in Chicago, then I don't think Georgia Tech is as good (perhaps the difference isn't big but still a consideration)
* When I talked to people about Georgia Tech clubs, they mentioned how it's waning and not as good as before
* My co-founder is in Chicago for the startup I am doing so it is nicer to be closer
* Not good in entrepreneurship (fermi paradox of startups)

I am grateful I got both, they are great programs. Any insights is really helpful."

* Windows: nice big windows, though they ran perpendicular to the seating. The view wasn‚Äôt the best as it just looked out to Krannert, but I got a seat on the second floor and positioned myself to look at the trees in front of Krannert.
* Seating: Enough seating for how empty it was. There was mostly group seating on the first floor and on the second floor there were mostly individual desks. I pulled my desk forward to have better access to look out the window.
* Comfortability: Quite comfortable, if a little warm. The lighting wasn‚Äôt too dark or too bright so that was not anything I noticed. By the end of the two hours that I was there the chair started to hurt my back though, probably because it was one of the ones with the hole where your lower back is.
* Noise: The first floor with group seating was at a quiet speaking level, and the second floor was pretty much silent.
* Bathrooms: Went to the bathroom on the first floor, it was a nice, typical gray bathroom. There were a bunch of stalls and paper hand drying. My only complaint is that the stalls are not very wide, and the feminine trash can is on a separate side as the toilet paper which makes it even more cramped.
* Location: A little far away to be convenient. I live at Ikenberry, so the walk back is around 20 minutes, which is not too bad but a little out of the way. If you live at ISR this would be much more convenient.¬†
* Aesthetics: typical ugly library, there was pencil graffiti on the wall next to the desk I am sitting at and the ceiling is a drop ceiling with stains on it. Overall, not the best looking, but that really is not that important.
* Anything Else: Building was difficult to navigate as it was my first time here. Also, when my arms would get sweaty, they would stick to the desks.

like last night i was awoken by them facetiming @ 2 am and i couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep till 4, i was aggravated as hell.
like i get they‚Äôre long distance and stuff but at the same time, it‚Äôs non stop baby-talk, gross convos and comments, loudness, and i just don‚Äôt know if im overreacting bc if i am then i won‚Äôt say anything. 
he‚Äôs also coming over this weekend and im dreading it üò≠

i also would like some advice on asking for more time alone in my room. most days im gone for hours a day, so she gets plenty alone time herself, but she never leaves the room and is starting to skip classes more. 
i‚Äôve dealt with it for this long but recently im feeling a little more aggravated which sucks bc i try to be lenient and chill and mind my own business :/

basically, am i being a dick for feeling like this?

I am not a good test taker which is why I usually like coding classes because half (or more than half) of your grade is typically focused on projects, which I tend to do better on. I recently received a FAIR violation saying my code was 85% similar to several other students code. I did not cheat on this MP, I went to office hours almost everyday and although the concept was hard I knew it was going to be important to understand it and put in the work to do it on my own, I had a friend who got mossed last semester and have never even thought about looking at someone elses code or giving my code out. This violation would be very detrimental to my grade in the class and I would be at risk of failing. I made the mistake of not including all my evidence in my initial response to the FAIR allegation so I am taking it to the appeal stage. I am writing to ask if anyone has experience with appealing FAIR violations, and what the outcome was. I would appreciate honesty at this time. Thanks."
Carle Hospital $800 ER bill,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1gquxd5/carle_hospital_800_er_bill/,125,77,2024-11-14 02:47:29,"TLDR: Got landed $800 dollar bill in my mailbox. I feel so hopeless in life.

Background: International Grad Student, no income. I was having a month of difficulty eating food and loss my appetite due to stress I guess. It got to the point where I was so weak that lying on bed my legs still hurt badly. After talking to 24-dial a nurse, I was told to go to the ER room immediately. I was scared of the expenses and but was told that the insurance would cover all the costs and I shouldn‚Äôt worry about that. So I went to the ER room immediately.

I went and they took my blood and run some tests and concluded there was nothing wrong with me physically and it‚Äôs just my mental state causing the problems. So I just went back home.

I still have difficulty eating food these days but have learned to cope with it sadly. I can get in a normal person portion of 1 meal per day. However, my weight still goes up‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Basically a month later the hospital bill arrives in my mailbox. I talked to the representative for student insurances for the school and they said every statement was correct. I would need to pay $800 dollars and there‚Äôs nothing they can do. They told me to apply for financial assistance for Carle, and I did today, and I will wait for their decision.

Just wanted to rant a bit. I feel tricked by the person who told me to go to the ER‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and was shocked by the egregious amount of the bill(that didn‚Äôt do anything to help me). Honestly, I don‚Äôt mind paying the doctor for their time but $800 for a visit? Non profit my ass. I had no choice but to go to the ER since I didn‚Äôt have a family doctor( international student) who can refer me to an appointment at the hospital.( I needed to be checked at a hospital)

Has anyone been a similar situation? Is there any other resources for me to utilize? Any suggestions please!"

The Problem Of The Hero: Film Screening Sunday. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1grbr2c/the_problem_of_the_hero_film_screening_sunday/,4,0,2024-11-14 18:35:35,"We've got two film screenings this month, one on Sunday the 17th, and one on Sunday the 24th. Both at the Savoy 16 + IMAX at 4pm. 

[https://vimeo.com/786684025](https://vimeo.com/786684025)

The first is The Problem Of The Hero, a fictional narrative piece based on true events.

Before the events of the film, in 1940, Richard Wright wrote the novel¬†[Native Son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Son), about Bigger Thomas, a 20-year-old black youth living on Chicago‚Äôs South Side, who accidentally kills a white woman. It was an immediate best-seller.

Later that year, Orson Welles approached Wright about turning the book into a play and hired Wright and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright & social activist Paul Green to turn the book into a play. After handing in the script, Green returns home. The night before the film begins, Green attends a dress rehearsal of the play and discovers that they have changed some of the script. He is especially incensed that they have changed the ending of the film.

During the course of the film, Wright and Green have a sometimes friendly, sometimes heated argument centered around the changes in the play, but also expanding to larger issues about art, politics, race, class, commerce and their personal histories. They argue so strongly, that after the events of the film, the two never speak again. 

While The Problem Of The Hero is still playing on the festival circuit, it‚Äôs scheduled for a wider release next year, and it only has 11 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a¬†**100% fresh rating.**¬†You can read a review at¬†[Film Threat](https://filmthreat.com/reviews/the-problem-of-the-hero/), or by one of my favorite critics,¬†[The Independent Critic](https://theindependentcritic.com/the_problem_of_the_hero)¬†from Indianapolis.

That day I made an emergency maintenance request with Smile to fix the issue. It is now November 14 and there has yet to be anything fixed. I am wondering if anyone has advice on why I can do moving forward and where I can report this (if anywhere). I still have standing water in my dishwasher. I had to clean the sewage myself which didn‚Äôt seem like something that was safe. There‚Äôs also a few other little things regarding all of this that just makes it worse. I couldn‚Äôt live in my apartment for a week and had to commute an hour to and from for school and work. Literally any advice/help/guidance is appreciated.

Here is some background info on me and all my stats:

* Cambodian-American male who was raised by a single mother and had divorced parents.
* I went to a small charter school (graduating class is 217)
* From Chicago (So U of I is my state school)
* Selected Major: Statistics and Computer Science
* low income
* 3.6/4.0 unweighted and 4.023/5 weighted
* 1290 SAT (applied test optional)
* 9 APs
* I am the president of the Asian Social Club at my school, the treasurer of student government and NHS, and I play varsity volleyball + was the girls' volleyball manager. I also worked two part-time jobs and did a research internship in the summer.

The last time Trump won, I immediately booked a flight to London. I thought I‚Äôd escape the chaos and find refuge among more enlightened, liberal folks. And wow, what a place! I got to experience firsthand the magic of universal healthcare: standing in line for so long, I almost became friends with my herniated disc. But at least the rich and poor were suffering together!

The trip got even better when someone broke my arm just to steal my watch. Honestly, I was touched‚Äîthey left my phone because it was too outdated. What a considerate mugger! London truly is a city of equality.

On my way home, I decided to visit California to see the wonderful things Gavin Newsom has done for the state. The transformation was incredible. He took a once-beautiful, thriving city and turned it into a social experiment! Poverty and safe injection sites everywhere you look‚Äîit‚Äôs like an urban safari! I even got to pet a stray hypodermic needle. You just don‚Äôt get that kind of experience anywhere else.

Every year, UIUC OOS students spend millions on flights.

For the last few months, we‚Äôve been cooking up something that we think will actually change things. We‚Äôve put out some pretty cool features before, got a bunch of users, but nothing really compares to this.

We‚Äôve made a discount algorithm that literally gives UIUC students cheaper winter break flights.

Basically, Jumpseat bets on the airline‚Äôs price dropping later, but you don‚Äôt have to worry about any of that. You get the best rate we can offer immediately. If prices drop further, Jumpseat comes out ahead. If prices don‚Äôt, we take the hit. Either way, you get the lowest price without the stress and the risk.

I want to be clear that this isn‚Äôt just another price drop protection or reimbursement feature. These deals mean you simply pay less right now. Period.

On average, each discounted flight is **\~15% cheaper than Google Flights**, which means they're also cheaper than the airline/Kayak/Expedia. And here‚Äôs our guarantee: if you find a lower rate on Google Flights for a flight, we‚Äôll not only pay you the difference‚Äîwe‚Äôll add an extra 30% off that flight.

Right now, we have enough data to support winter break travel dates to 15 of the biggest US airports. Contact us with questions/feedback please: [team@jumpseatapp.com](mailto:team@jumpseatapp.com). I expect a few bugs on launch day so if you've got a few minutes to stress test it, it'd be much appreciated.

My keys fell out of my pocket last night on the bus. I was sitting on the driver‚Äôs side, past the middle of the bus (i.e. past the second doors). It‚Äôs a single car key/key fob attached to a smaller grey plastic circle. Likely on a silver key ring - it‚Äôs pretty nondescript.

I‚Äôve been calling MTD to try and find the key with no luck. 

This is pretty devastating for me. The key is to my car, which is currently in a lot where it‚Äôs illegal to park at night. Luckily, last night, it wasn‚Äôt towed. But it could be towed any night until I find the key. I‚Äôm a broke grad student and I desperately need my car.

What's up with George Danos getting re-elected?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1godun8/whats_up_with_george_danos_getting_reelected/,65,20,2024-11-10 23:15:02,"IPM Newsroom ran [a story](https://ipmnewsroom.org/amid-issues-with-the-champaign-county-auditor-voters-will-decide-if-the-office-should-be-eliminated/) about how George Danos was late with the audit three times (once by a year). The audit is required for Champaign County to get funding from the state for social services. Danos said that there was no penalty for being late, so it was completely fine. It appears that Danos didn't log in to the computer system to do the audit for months at a time according to a FOIA. There's a lot of other stuff in the article too.

I thought he would be beaten easily by his opponent or the referendum would succeed in making the position appointed rather than elected. However, both failed. The position remained elected (60 to 40%) and he won it (54 to 46%). I guess voters value the auditor being independent rather than competent?

On the other hand, I probably don't know the whole story. Does anybody know what's going on?

Edit: yes a bunch of people probably just voted straight D without doing any research, but why do many yard signs ""Vote no to keep the auditor""? It seemed like some people were rooting for him."

What I'm planning to do is just buy a used 1L desktop with i5 4570 to do it and the power the whole systme needs should be around 120w. I heard that students are allowed to have a small refrigerator in their rooms. And I assume a refrigerator obviously needs to run 24/7 while they should take about the same power as what I need. Hence I'm guessing it is possible to set up a 24/7 server then?

  
Moreover, I heard that uiuc will blacklist devices that have strange data usage while connecting to university internet. Because my server will definitely connect to the school internet, do I need to be aware of anything or if there is any place I can check the policy?"

As a quiet freshman, I made very few friends, but I've been more outgoing this year. That said, my academic-focused extracurriculars haven‚Äôt been as rewarding socially as I‚Äôd hoped. Volunteering was a big part of my life in high school, but I haven‚Äôt been very involved in it here, and I miss it.

I‚Äôve heard APO might be a good place to make friends, but I‚Äôm not sure what to expect. Of course, I plan to attend an info session next semester, but I‚Äôd love to hear any thoughts or experiences in the meantime.

Joint student boycott of dining halls and food service worker restrike?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1gp2qs5/joint_student_boycott_of_dining_halls_and_food/,0,23,2024-11-11 20:47:48,"Look y‚Äôall. We got ice cream police at Ike lol. 
The students and workers deserve better. The students deserve FULL service until close and the workers need to be paid past closing and have a raise. (Hence some of the reasons they went on strike) 

Do u guys think a student boycott and a worker strike could work? Seeing that this semester is going to wrap up and the new one will commence soon it‚Äôs a good time to raise our standards. 

The only flaw I see is that potentially ppl will not stand in solidarity and fuck it up for everyone else like the sell outs they are. 
Also the fact that we paid already but we have to do something because as consumers and workers we are pitted against each other as collateral damage to the university failing its workers. 

Side note: when u get paid to do something u do the job right & When u pay for something u have every right to what u paid for.

Hello! Graphic Design Prospective Student,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1gop1sz/hello_graphic_design_prospective_student/,0,7,2024-11-11 10:17:07,"Hello UofI! I have currently applied for Fall 2025 early action and was looking to get a Bachelor's in Graphic design. I have I A LOT of questions about student life, academics (especially for art, media, and design), and what I might expect as a student. I will try my best to section this out the best I can so I make sense (^_^‚ô™)! 

First I would like to state that I do have the smallest bit of experience with university. Back in 2023 I can down to take a tour of the university (Main Quad area, Siebel Center of Design, and the main Building for the college of Fine and Applied art) and the summer of 2024 I took an art intensive at the university to see what is would be like to stay at the dorms and be a student (It was probably the best summer intensive I taken, would 100‚ÑÖ do it again.) Doing these have answered a lot of questions I had but the main concerns I have are:

-How crazy can you get with dorm decorating? 

- Is the current living situation good from people in dorms or should I try to figure something else out? 

- How do the dining plans work exactly? 

- How does the university determined which dorms you'll be in?

- Which dining hall is the best? (In terms of waiting times, food options, and seating.Iw mainly ate at IKE but went to ISR one day out of the week long intensive, I like ISR a bit better but that was only cause the ice cream machine worked better) 

I know the current housing situation has been impacted by the strike, and I hope that the staff gets payed way better because I know how hard they worked and have been working to servers thousands of students! Thank you to all the staff that helped me during the super intensive, you made the short time I had there so much better for me and all the other students there! o(„ÄÉÔºæ‚ñΩÔºæ„ÄÉ)o

I also have some questions based around the university facilities and academics. 

- I know about the Fab Lab, the workshop/Lab in the SCD, and the Lab in the main Fine Arts build. Is there any other creative labs that students have access to and what do to charge for you to access them? (I know it about $90 to have access to the print lab in themainf fine arts Building but idk what everything else cost?) 

- I was told that Japan house offers workshops and courses to university students, what course can I take and how fast do they fill? 

- What courses are generally required for Fine Arts majors? 

- I like to wander around and see different parts of the university, what are some places that I can explore on my own and which ones are recommended for you to go on a tour of? 

- When are finals and midterms? 

-How should I prepare myself for university (Like should I have certain things, be doing certain things, or preping academically so I don't have to take courses at the uni)

-Who should I contact about scholarships? 

I what to be prepared for going to uni the best I can so I can take the most amount off myself in the long run. I know I probably should be contacting certain offices about some of these questions but I'm not exactly sure where to with some of these questions, hense why I'm here. ·ê†( ·êõ )·êü

NOW FOR THE FUN QUESTIONS! These are more about was general life is like around Urban-Champaign area, and some student life questions! I live in then Northern Will, South Cook County area, so I'm only like a hour and a half drive away if that. I also know about and been around a lot of the Chicago suburbs, but I don't really go South of Kankakee that often so I don't know the Chambana area well, other than Green Street and what I've seen on Google Maps. (Now with that lil summary over let's get into the questions ·ïï( ·êõ )·ïó!) 

-What are some recommended cafe's/bakeries around Chambana? (Especially ones with good seating and tables) 

- What are some of the goofiest students organizations? (I know about the squirrel watching club and the watchers of the squirrel watchers) 

- What are some good hang out spots (preferably for people under 21) 

-What are the best restaurants? 

- What are some good events that are held in Chambana? (Specifically comiccons, anime expos, art & crafts fairs, Ren fairs, and some. Cultural events that anyone can go to! ) 

- Are there any arcades or gaming clubs on campus? (I know of the rec center at the Union) 

-Does it matter what you where class? 

- Where do I get to good snacks on campus?

- How chill are people? 

- What are some things that I should avoid? (especially as a woman and a new adult) 

- Are you allowed to pet the Squirrels? (If they even let you) 

- What are some chill or cozy spots around campus? (Either for drawing, studying, reading, or just vibing) 

That was a lot... I'm sorry for all the questions.  ‚ï•Ôπè‚ï•

I know I yap A LOT but I want to know about UIUC and the people here! I hope that I have a chance of getting in and that I'll be welcome. To all of the lovely people reading this thank you! I hope you have a wonderful day and thank you for taking the time to read this!

""Actively working on it,"" meaning that in the past four days without raining, they did nothing so today it happens again.

Political Science Concentrations: Public Pol and Demo Institutions or Law & Power?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1gog314/political_science_concentrations_public_pol_and/,1,2,2024-11-11 01:02:16,"Hi, I'm a current pre-law student looking to major in PS, and graduate in about 3 yrs. As a result, I'm currently looking at the concentrations and trying to make a decision about which one would be better for me as a pre-law who wants to go into public service law (aka civil rights, policies on inequity/equality) and wanted to see if any former/current PS students would have advice on which concentration to choose. 

I'm currently in between Public Pol and Demo Insti or Law & Power. Based on the name itself, Public Pol seems more aligned to my goals, but after reading the description of Law & Power, it seems more focused on giving me the tools to fight for policies as a lawyer as compared to the Public Pol concentration. 

I'm not trying to figure out which one is better for law school -- realistically, I don't think they'll care which concentration I'm in that much. I'm mostly looking to see which one y'all believe have better classes and/or resources for being an effective public service lawyer (ie. how to present policies, how to better understand inequalities or disparities, the tools to be an effective lawyer etc)?

I've currently been sick for three almost four weeks. It started out as a bad cold, then it got better, then I got sick again, and now I have pink eye I've had for 5 days with no signs of going away. I've been to McKinley 4 times in the past month. Ive had several blood tests done (CBC, mono, HIV) to see if there is anything that could be causing this but they cant figure it out. I used to bounce back from being sick very quickly but now I get sick and stay sick for a long time.
I had a nurse at McKinley tell me this isn't uncommon here, since everyone is from different parts of the country/world and in such close quarters all the time. A few other people I've met said they get sicker when they are at school here.

A handy app to watch lectures and online courses (and videos on social networks and on all sites) in a smart way - ClipGlider,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1gnzyug/a_handy_app_to_watch_lectures_and_online_courses/,0,0,2024-11-10 12:50:21,"It seems very few UIUC students are aware of ClipGlider app - it's rather useful when studying, it displays a video playback control panel while a video is playing on all websites (e.g. with online courses or lecture recordings) and in social networks (e.g. YouTube, Instagram or X/Twitter), adding a lot of functions to control video playback:

1. Change playback speed (in rage from 0.07x to 16x with 0.01x precission). Without ClipGlider, most sites and social networks do not allow speeds over 2x, and allow only 0.25x as a step..
2. Ability to scrub (play video at extra speed, default is 3x, set in app settings) by holding a finger on the panel - works even in YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels! Without ClipGlider, scrubbing is fixed at 2x and works only in YouTube and only for long videos.
3. Ability to jump back/forward by 15/120/300 seconds in one tap
4. Ability to jump to a specific moment in time by directly specifying the timestamp or %, e.g. 1h:28m (you choose ""1"", ""2"", ""8"" from drop-down lists), or 38% of the video. Useful for navigating long lectures!
5. All videos will start playing at the speed you set in the preferences.
6. Ability to amplify the sound of the online video you are watching¬†*(works on Android only)*¬†\- useful for watching videos in noisy environments like cafe
7. Ability to remove audio noise from the video¬†*(works only on Android)*¬†\- useful for watching lectures recorded using cheap microphone located far away from speaker.
8. Control video playback with external keyboard or gamepad (for advanced users who do something while watching videos and their hands are busy or wet).

These features are extremely useful for watching lectures and studying:

1. Speeds over 2x - for watching lectures if teacher is old and speaks slowly - such videos are fine to be watched at 3x or even 3.5x.. Or you can watch films or shows at 1.15x speed. This allows to save a lot of time.
2. Ability to remove noise is also handy when watching lectures.
3. Watching content in foreign languages at 0.90x speed while learning languages. Without ClipGlider, you have to choose either 0.75x (too slow) or 1x (no slowdown) speed..

Also ClipGlider supports autoscrolling (autonext) of short videos (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels), so you can watch Reels or Shorts of an expert/coach or foreign speaker while doing some work or exercises, without touching the screen.

[screenshot: watching Reels with ClipGlider panel on top](https://preview.redd.it/wur6bm51m20e1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=d42f9073b2b8697e5552e86249d23706d4b78418)

It really revolutionizes the way people watch videos online in social networks and on all websites, including Coursera, Udemy and Netflix and other websites with online-courses and lectures.

It seems that there are no other applications on mobile phones that offer such features.

ClipGlider is available¬†for¬†[iPhone/iPad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clipglider-control-for-video/id6446220573)¬†and also¬†[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clipglider.gpmain)¬†phones and tablets¬†(and even including Chromebooks and smart-TVs with Android TV).

No driver has taken my order so I can't even message to ask them not to cancel.

Since the posts I can find are rather old. I wanted to ask if anyone have other suggestions for modes of transportation, 24/7 taxi service, or anything I can do to make sure I can get to the airport on time?

Keep in mind that this is, and I am not exaggerating here, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. For context, only 34,000 North Korean defectors reside in South Korea and fewer than 300 in the United States, with just a tiny fraction from the capital of Pyongyang. Out of all the places throughout the country they could have connected with, it's extraordinary that they chose our UIUC community for this exclusive conversation!

Don‚Äôt have major in 3 years,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1gmx3l1/dont_have_major_in_3_years/,0,15,2024-11-09 00:05:36,"Just like title said: I literally don‚Äôt have a true major in 2 and half a year now, and I will also don't have a major in next spring semester, making it three years. Undeclared major is not a diploma, so I can say I don‚Äôt have a major.

Abstract: I stayed in DGS for 2 semesters, EU for 3 semesters and then will maintain EU in next semester(probably).

The following are details, serveral long paragraphs. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I enrolled to college, I was DGS student, after I stayed there for a year and get 3.92 GPA(get B- in Che 102), I transfered to Engineering  Undeclared. 

In my first semester in EU, I selected ECE110,120, PHY 212 and some other course. I got B in ECE120, and A- in 110 and PHY 212(f*** the lab). And all As in rest of course. I applied to EE as my first choice and CE as my second choice, and Industrial E as my third choice. I was told I am not competitive and they let me stay in this god d*** place for a next semester. My advisor, a very mean man with fake smile name started with J, told me I should get A in ECE210 in the following semester.

Then I select that course, PHY 213, math 257, math285. And some genED courses. ECE 210 is a sh**, so many workload every week. Ok, I got C. Math 257, I got B. Then A- in physics 213 because I misread the syllabus and didn‚Äôt go to lecture and 2.5 grades was deducted. Then rest of courses are A.

last semester when I begin to submit my application again.I rewrote 6 essays but make some changes. It was a terrible semester and the deadline to submit is close to final exam which made me mental breakdown. Also because I was rejected last time, I decided to write 4 essays carefully, including why I want to choose first major. But I didn‚Äôt write the reason of choosing second and third major in a good way. Yes, I just said I literally don‚Äôt want be allocated to these two major and I just want my first major.

Then EU didn‚Äôt give me a response as I wanted. They said my score was not good, did not show progressing,didn't show my exploration of three majors, seemed I don‚Äôt like second and third major. They decided to let me transfer to other college in 6th semester(5th semester still in EU for preparing transfer). 

EU is bad. Why don‚Äôt offer me any major on my first application? Their requirment said student are sure to be admitted by third choice if the first and second major willingness are rejected. 

Now I am still in EU, I want them to change the idea but they don‚Äôt. My advisor even said "" seem you waste your second year"". How could this sentence come from his mouth? He is advisor and don't provide any help indeed. He doesn't help me in anything except lift the registration restriction. Other EU advisors are good, I just very dislike him.

Now I feel everything is on the right track. I select 6 courses and I am sure I would get all As. I will transfer to STAT next semester. But just today I found that ICT closed last week(Oct 17th- Nov 1th). The next time would be end of January. I would not have any major in 3 years. 

EU is stupid. I NEVER HEARD  a university program like this. I am very regretful about not transferring to other universities after 1st year when I have a good grade.  

I don‚Äôt know what to do right now. Should I contact to stat department, or find dean? I don‚Äôt know who can help me. I want to maintain in eng but seems they don‚Äôt want. Is there any solvable suggestions? Appreciate it."

I don't go out partying and the only people I'm around for long times on a very regular basis are random classmates who don't seem to be sick, so could it be likely that they aren't showing symptoms but still contagious or is it possible to get sick from sitting behind someone who was coughing for a one off hour long event.

I am also curious as to what social life is like at UIUC with the drinking age being 21, I'm not massively bothered on drinking a lot but it is nice to go out once in a while, especially when studying abroad as I am going for the ""American college experience"". I'm assuming that because of the laws potentially student clubs/organisations may be the best way people socialise/make friends but please correct me if I'm wrong. 

Also, as I will be looking to travel around the country at times (NY, San Francisco, Seattle etc.) would getting a coach to Chicago O'Hare airport and then flying be the cheapest option?

Additionally, would anyone be able to give any insight into the cost of living in Champaign compared to the rest of the country particularly in terms of groceries and eating out, I've seen the dorm prices and they seem very reasonable compared to the UK. Also does the university gym and student clubs cost money or do you have to buy memberships?

I will be applying to UIUC MCS program for Fall' 25 and the admissions page states the above as the course prerequisites.

Since my undergrad was in ECE, I didn't have a course on 'Theory of Computation'. I am from India and so the option to complete the course at a local university is not there. Can anyone recommend any online courses/certification to make up for it?

Women of ARC and CRCE, why do some of you take off your shirt outside the locker room?

I get it, the [rules](https://campusrec.illinois.edu/policies/general#clothing) say ""attire must cover the chest"", and your sports bra does follow that rule to the letter.

I respect your choice to do this. Really. But, help me understand why. Is it some kind of feminist power move I am unfamiliar with?

You know that it is high-quality non-stop entertainment for everyone attracted to girls, right? I for one am uncomfortable enough that I am looking at my shoes every time one of you shirtless girls comes near. I fear one of you will eventually accuse me of staring at you.

Free parking is available in the driveway, and guests can park for free on the street. The building also has a free washer and dryer available for residents (free, no coins needed).

The kitchen is spacious with ample cupboard space, a 4-burner gas stove, and a self-cleaning gas oven. The unit is approximately 900 sq ft, providing plenty of space and natural light from the many windows.

Lease Term: Move-in date is flexible, we can work it out! The lease runs until July 2025.

Rent: The master bedroom is listed at $979/month plus a $20 master bedroom fee, but I‚Äôm offering it at $849/month (that's a $150 discount!).

Location: It‚Äôs right on Green Street‚Äîjust a 5-minute walk to tons of restaurants, cafes, and stores. There‚Äôs even a Chinese grocery store nearby, so everything is super convenient.

Transportation: There‚Äôs a bus stop literally right outside the apartment, super easy to get around.

Building Amenities: We‚Äôve got a gym, game room, package lockers, and a huge study room.

Room Details: The living room is huge, and the apartment faces west, so you get incredible sunsets and tons of natural light during the day.

Roommates: One is a grad student, and the other is an international student. Both are really quiet and clean, and the living room is always spotless. I‚Äôve never actually lived in the room, so it‚Äôs basically brand new, and the bathroom has never been used either.

If i don't have a legal status here, I'll be forced to go back and be forced to marry a woman. That's a life worse than death.
