Eyes wide shut (trigger warning),https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/1gvbjvt/eyes_wide_shut_trigger_warning/,88,4,2024-11-19 23:40:21,"If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, did it fall?

If a student sexually assaults another student, stalks them, lives and works next to them, takes classes with them, but no one is allowed or willing to say anything about it, did it ever happen?

Some comments that still replay over and over in my mind, daily:

""Did you say anything that would make them do that to you?""

""Have you tried not talking to them?""

""We would recommend not going to the police about this.""

""It wouldn't make any difference.""

""What did you expect was going to happen?""

""Please don't get mad at them.""

""They've been very cooperative with us""

""I don't believe in punishment personally. According to Focault..""

""You're just going to have to get used to working with them.""

""It's not that important.""

""Have you tried killing yourself?""

I am sitting with my colleagues. I sense a figure approach me from behind. I freeze. There's nothing I can say and nothing I can do. I want to run. Everyone is laughing and smiling; I am terrified. Two hands violently grab my shoulders from behind. I turn and see a horrible smile. The same smile I saw the night my life changed forever when I decided to be at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people. My shoulders still tense up to this day. I don't even want my own family to touch me anymore.

A grinning colleague comments after they leave: ""wow, they were really happy to see you!"" I have no memory of what I said next.

In a dream a hand starts reaching toward me with a long arm. I prepare myself as the hand begins approaching my body. I imagine a sword in my hand with a very sharp blade. I close my eyes and swing at the hand, and inside I am screaming with all of my soul: ""STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

*The white of the eyes, and dark within*.

I don't know what's harder to stomach. My own weakness for being unable to protect myself, for following the advice of people who only had their own self-interest in mind? That my assailants escaped responsibility for their actions and continue to thrive? Or that there were good people who stood by and held the door open for them, presumably out of fear and self-preservation? I suppose none of that matters anymore.

How can you tell the truth when you're living in fear? Will the truth even matter when it finally comes to light? So many suffer in silence while their abusers walk free, enabled by people around them who are only ""good"" as long as it is convenient for them. Award-winning deniers and normalizers of sexual violence. Why shine a light on the uncomfortable reality when you can avert your eyes and deny the darkness right in front of you, inside of your own heart?

Trust your instincts and your memories. They will try to convince you that you are not hurting as much as you are. They will try to convince you that you are responsible for being victimized. They will try to convince you that this is the reality of academia. They will try to convince you that you have no voice and no power. They are really trying to convince themselves. That it is okay to silence people and crush their dreams, so long as scandal is avoided, so long as the illusions of equal opportunity and professional conduct are maintained.

Keep the receipts of unwanted conversations and comments. Write down the order of events. Get advice from the people in your life you trust the most, not just the campus authorities and people in positions of power. Excuse yourself at any point during an uncomfortable situation or encounter with another student or faculty member. Do not be bullied into giving up your right to speak about your experiences. Do not let others mitigate or downplay what happened to you; they have no right to tell you how to react to abuse. Be extremely careful around other students and alcohol. I was molested by the some of the people I respected and trusted the most. I never expected who they were underneath. I never expected this would be allowed at Stanford of all places. They will still tell you that it isn't allowed. Except that is; I exist, and my memories are not false, and my voice is real.

But to Stanford, I may as well not even be a person who ever lived, let alone attended. And to be fair, there are so many good memories that I have either blocked out, or because I was living in so much fear at the time, I never made solid memories of the good times. I remember coming to this school because I was in love with learning and with people. I left with my love for my field shattered, my trust in people obliterated, and my respect for Stanford utterly hollowed out.

When I see the Stanford ""S"" now, it only stands for one thing.

Follow your dreams. Fight, believe, and keep trudging forward. And for the sake others who may be suffering, don't steer your eyes away from the truth. Just by listening and believing their stories, you might be saving a life.

I'm sorry if this came across as cryptic or confusing. I've stayed silent and afraid for so long that I don't know how else to approach it. But if one person feels less alone, less powerless to speak, then maybe everything I went through wasn't for nothing. Stay safe everyone."

STATS 118,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/1gu1cro/stats_118/,5,1,2024-11-18 09:57:11,"Hello all,

Since STATS 116 has been split to STATS 117 and 118, I am wondering what does 118 look like? What's its textbook and scope? From the (very brief) course introduction, I think its on the intersection of probability and statistics. In addition, all topics listed have been covered in CS 109:  
So I guess it's just getting one level deeper?

* Sampling distributions of sums
* Means
* Variances
* Convolutions
* Moment generating functions
* Limit theorems

I have taken CS 109 and 118 should be the next stats course, but I guess they should be dramatically different in terms of difficulty level and teaching style (well chris piech's style is different from anyone else....)"

"Currently visiting Silicon Valley/Palo Alto from London, UK. Filmmaker writing a screenplay. Researching tech, startups, FAANG and specifically interested to meet Stanford students that went to Paly, Gunn or Menlo Atherton with a parent or parents in tech.

Pretty new here so if I don’t follow protocols correctly, I apologise in advance. Feel free to tell me where I’m going wrong.

I’m an English screenwriter, director and producer based in London UK, researching the culture and psychology of tech, Palo Alto and Silicon Valley. Have been been meeting engineers and others in (big tech and startups) in person this week. Am staying in an AirBnB next to Paly / campus, here till Thursday lunchtime.

This is for a feature film I’m writing (working title: SOLID STATE)—currently a revenge psychological drama--and also for a short film to serve as a promo to raise finance.

My last film, [THE ELECTRICITY IN ME](https://directorslibrary.com/01/2023/latest/short-films/narrative-short/the-electricity-in-me/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZxMrbF3AhvH7lBFmFpqmPdw4T6q87DipB-KZusQnEqWa8eaUitQntOboI_aem_9SsPJtk5ttFkINF78stalQ), also a short, was accepted into 23 festivals in total, a number of which were BAFTA/Academy accredited, premiered in HollyShorts Festival at the legendary Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard and won three awards. You can see my films here [www.AESTHETIK.film](http://www.aesthetik.film/).

So--I'm interested in a couple of specifics: 

(1) How having parents in tech (big tech and startups) impacts on family life, if at all. Or maybe you didn't really notice or care.

(2) Parental expectations regarding academic performance, grades, additional activities which would help you get into college.

(3) What the environment is like in local high schools? There are many many posts about the additional pressures there are to attend high school here, as a young person, but as I've found, Reddit posts do not tell the whole story though have been helpful.

So, if people want to take advantage of the offer of free coffee, lunch or dinner, I’d be very interested to hear your insights, even if only for 20 or 30 mins. I know you're busy, so will be as efficient as your schedule requires.

Absolutely no obligation to say any personal details about your family or indeed (as I've been saying to the techs I've met) you don't even need to tell me your name... DMs, comments very (very) welcome also.

Happy to meet on campus, downtown, wherever you feel most comfortable. And, you're very welcome to bring a friend(s) too if you'd prefer. 

thanks in advance

I was accepted for a masters in Stanford, an unique opportunity that would completely change my life. I come from a poor background, I am the first in my family to hold a bachelors degree and receive more than a minimum salary in Brazil. I am graduated in automation and control engineering, and today I have a comfortable life and I can support my parents. My dream was always to study a masters abroad. I was accepted in many universities, and Stanford was the best one. However, I cant support my studies. The total cost with tuition fees and living expenses, also the conversion rate real <-> dolar, is too high and impossible for me. I applied for the Knight-Henessy scholarship and a brazilian one, and unfortunately I didn't succeed. They are very competitive, and those scholarships look for people with a strong social engagement, which I confess I don't have that much. I have volunteered while I was studying, but that is it. I really dont want to lose this unique opportunity. Is there any chance I can get a scholarship by directly contacting a teacher, for some student job, research, anything? I really appreciate your help."

* MS student with F1 visa. Scheduled to finish in Winter. Just got offered a full-time internship for Winter and Spring. 
* Wanted to ask for a leave of absence during Winter and work full-time, then return to campus on Spring, finish the degree and continue working but part-time. Bechtel told me a leave of absence would mean I have to leave the US, so not an option. Friend told me he managed to get an HCP (part time student status?) and enrolled in the 3 credit minimum to to legally stay in the US, and be able to work.
   * Side note: I REALLY want to take some Spring classes that cannot be done during Winter, that's a big reason why I looked into a Winter leave, and a Spring return.
* Additionally, the employer wants someone who can work full-time, so even the part-time alternative (if I managed to get through it) could prove to be problematic. From what I hear, CPT authorizations only allow for 20h/week. How tough are these restrictions really (i.e., enforceable?).

I do not have a lot of savings and cannot afford this emergency expense.

Does anybody have the equipment to do this sort of thing for me? Picture attached for the type of lock. Likely will need an electric saw tool as I tried bolt cutters and they do not work. Might even end up buying an electric saw myself for $40 on Amazon because it is less expensive to just buy the tool and do it myself. But I would rather pay someone else to cut the lock for me, at a reasonable price. 

I am not supporting Campus Bike Shop’s price-gouging……..$80 is insane and I don’t think it used to be that way. >$120 to cut off the lock and buy a new one means it’s pretty much better to just buy a new Walmart/Target bike at this point. Maybe this is why we have a bike problem on campus.

lowkey feeling like which undergrad you go to would define your early-, if not your entire, career trajectory.

🌲 folks at stanford — what opportunities do you think your undergrad degree bring? 

my guesses: 

1.people say “it’s not what you know it’s who you know.” Feel like the stanford undergrad circle is exclusive, something you couldn’t enter as a Master student… 

Do you think being part of this community opens door to many, many opportunities?

2. do stanford undergrads have higher earning potentials in general? (truth or myth?)

I am an incoming transfer student. I am FLI (first generation low income) and am eligible for two years of aid at Stanford.

I’m very interested in majoring in philosophy, but I don’t have any prior coursework in it so it might be difficult to finish in 2 years. 

On top of that, I am pre-med.

I’ve gotten a few premed pre-requisites done, but have a LOT left.

My understanding is that Stanford will only fund you if it is to complete a major and earn your degree. 

My transfer advisor told me that I could take some premed coursework, but not much.

Then I emailed financial aid and it sounds like taking any premed classes will prohibit me from applying for additional aid.

I’m trying to figure out what the best thing to do is. Do I take one premed class per quarter and try to get a philosophy major done in 2 years? This would be 22 units per quarter for 6 quarters.

Or do I do a post-bac maybe?

Or do I just try to take some premed classes anyway and hope that they’ll still grant me aid if I take majority major classes?

If none of those are options, are there any good scholarship or grant opportunities I could look into for a potential third year?

Or just give up on premed because I like Philosophy a lot more? Go to law school instead? But so much of my experiences have been premed related lol. I don’t know what to do haha.

As far as I can tell from the programme page, the largest difference is that the Data Science programme lets you take more classes pass/fail as opposed to letter grade. Is there more I should know?

Also I received a scholarship that would pay for the MS but it only covers a year so I would have to do the very accelerated 3 quarters option. "
Is grad school the only path?,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/1fgg7uu/is_grad_school_the_only_path/,70,49,2024-09-14 06:50:26,"Does anyone else feel like the only viable path forward after graduating is grad school? Is it the only option left for me?

I graduated in June with a BS in Math and a BA in Art History, and since I've been completely defeated in the job market. I have been applying to jobs since March, and all I have to show for it is hundreds of rejections. I’m out of money, my credit card is nearly maxed out, I’m living on my friend’s couch, and I'm using food stamps to feed myself. Every day I pray for something to work out, but I can’t even get a mf fast food job.

I thought I did everything right, but it turns out I did each thing slightly wrong. I got a STEM degree but focused on pure rather than applied math which is apparently useless without a PhD. I did internships, but they were in the art world. I got to know my professors and did research with them, but the network I built is full of people who can pull strings at universities across the country but have never left academia and don’t know how to help me outside of suggesting I get a PhD. I went to a top school, but all the Stanford name seems to get me is rejections from low-skill jobs I desperately need because they assume I have the luxury of choice and I’m a flight risk. It honestly feels like I would be better off job wise if I replaced all the internships, research, passion, and prestige for a stock standard degree I clearly don't care about from a random public university.

I wanted to take a few years to make some money and gain perspective before going to grad school (or perhaps deciding I didn’t need it). But now I regret it every day. It feels like from where I am now, pursuing academia (or at least grad school) is the only avenue available. Regardless of if I want to chase tenure or go do industry a graduate degree is required. If entry level positions exist anymore they sure don't seem to want someone whose bachelor's degree was largely theoretical. 

Does anyone else feel like this? I feel very frustrated and alone in this. All my friends are at top universities in their fields for PhDs right now. I don't know anyone from Stanford looking for a job and I definitely don’t know anyone else who doesnt have a safety net to rely on post college. The worst part is even if I do apply and get into grad school I have to somehow keep a roof over my head for the next year. I don't know what to do. I didn't think life after Stanford would be easy, but I definitely didn't think it would be this hard. "

Warning to other Frosh and an Update since violating the Honor Code four years ago,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/1fga6wk/warning_to_other_frosh_and_an_update_since/,76,10,2024-09-14 00:46:40,"Hi friends,

It has been a while since I posted on reddit. This post is an update on my Honor Code situation from my frosh year.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/kp5rlc/honor\_code\_violation\_as\_a\_frosh\_and\_how\_to\_move\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/kp5rlc/honor_code_violation_as_a_frosh_and_how_to_move_on/)

TLDR: in my frosh year, I violated the Honor Code, and I struggled with a lot of anxiety since then.

After taking responsibility, I failed the class and simply moved on the next sequence. (example taking CS 106B after failing 106A.) Axess let me do it, so I did not care to waste the quarter retaking.

Here are some things that happened.

1. I graduated and got a easy, comfortably paying job in my field.
2. I did research at Stanford. It helped me get my very comfortable job.
3. I studied aboard.
4. I did not apply for Coterm, mainly because I didn't need it. I guess getting a master's degree for a lower price sounded alluring enough for me, but being in a college for another year was not for me.
5. Overtime, I stopped beating myself about my grades. I mean, I definitely tried my hardest, but not going to cry about a B+. Honestly made me a better person. I went to therapy in the immediate aftermath and it has helped me a lot.

I plan to work for a few years before considering going back to school. I am taking a few classes related to my major that I did not do so hot in, so hopefully things work out since the ERO will be off my record by then.

Since I got in trouble, OCS had done some much needed reforms so had someone else done what I did, I doubt that I would have gotten the same punishment. :( so life is life.

My advice to everyone is to not violate the Honor Code, take the bad grade. If you get caught by OCS, it might seem like the end of the world at the moment, but eventually the pain would subside."

On the one hand, CS224W seems like it takes a more fundamental/theoretical approach using LLMs as a case study while CS224V focuses more on the actual applications. Further, the reviews seem to suggest that 224W is slightly more intensive, but maybe more academically fulfilling as a result, while 224V seems to be a bit less in depth and cover a broader set of topics. Does anyone who has taken either of these courses feel strongly about either? Advice is appreciated!

Also for context, I have taken quite a few AI courses so far (221, 224N, 231N, 229, 205L) and am also planning on taking CS154 and CS229S this coming fall."

I am not sure of my major, but I am leaning towards math or physics, which is why I wanted to try out some of these classes in fall. However, even though this is only 13 units, do you think it is doable and will leave me time to make friends, apply for internships, find clubs, etc. Any insight would be helpful.

Thank you for all of your help! Really appreciate you guys putting up with all these schedule posts."

For some context, I have had a moderate amount of experience with basic electronics and have also read quite a bit on digital logic. However, I never really got a chance to get a good amount of experience at programming but somewhat understand the basic basic principles (like booleans, variables, loops, if statements..etc.) but nothing super advanced nor what the entirety of CS106A seems to cover as I read the syllabus.

My question is, how hard would it be to take ENGR40M with my sort of background (without taking CS106A before it), considering that ENGR40M does have a part where you do use Ardiuno to do some programming (at least from what I read on the syllabus of the course)."

# Reid Hoffman's Background and Views on AI

* [Reid Hoffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman) co-founded [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn) and [Inflection AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_AI), and served on the boards of [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) and [OpenAI.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI) 
* Hoffman believes that artificial intelligence will amplify human intelligence over a period of decades or centuries. 
* Hoffman argues that while AI is rapidly advancing, it still lacks the contextual awareness and adaptability of human intelligence. 

# AI's Strengths and Weaknesses

* Current AI models, while highly capable, lack the context awareness and adversarial gameplay seen in humans. 
* Humans possess superior planning capabilities, adapting and iterating strategies in complex, competitive scenarios. 
* Humans excel in handling novel, unusual situations, exemplified by their ability to outmaneuver autonomous vehicles. 

# Impact of AI on Society

* GPS has significantly enhanced navigation, making it easier to find locations and connect with people. 
* There is a concern that over-reliance on AI for decision-making, from driving directions to major life choices, could diminish critical thinking skills. 
* The increasing use of AI necessitates careful consideration of its potential influence on human behavior and the importance of promoting responsible AI development that empowers individuals. 
* There should be a balance between trusting established knowledge and allowing for innovation and differentiation. 
* [Generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) has the potential to benefit small gaming companies by providing access to advanced tools and resources, potentially leveling the playing field against larger studios. 
* In the future, holographic technology could make education more accessible, potentially shifting the centers of knowledge production away from Western institutions. 
* There are concerns that AI in education could be used to reinforce existing socioeconomic disparities, leading to civil unrest. 

# AI in Healthcare

* AI in healthcare has the potential to improve patient care, but there are concerns about patient privacy and the need for large amounts of data to train AI systems. 
* The only reason AI doctors are not widely available via smartphones by 2030 is due to regulations and liability concerns. 
* Large, established companies are unlikely to be the first to widely provide AI doctors due to the regulatory environment, while startups are more likely to take on the risk and navigate the regulations. 

# Inflection AI's Business Model and Approach

* [Inflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection) pivoted its [business model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model) from a public benefit corporation focused on personal AI agents to a B2B developer [API.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) 
* The reason for the pivot was the belief that the original mission of creating AI agents like Pi, which prioritizes users' well-being, would be better achieved through a larger platform and that the startup path wouldn't be sufficient. 
* Inflection claims to have a unique API because it trains emotional intelligence (EQ) equally with intelligence quotient (IQ) in its models. 
* Mustafa and Karen wanted to continue working on an AI agent and sought a mutually beneficial deal with [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft). 

# AI and Data Privacy

* Individuals may pay for AI agents that prioritize their needs over those of advertisers. 
* Companies should be transparent about their AI agents' operations, particularly regarding data usage and potential biases, to foster trust with users and potentially avoid government intervention. 
* There will be a variety of techniques developed to create synthetic data that can be used in place of actual customer data, addressing privacy concerns.

1. How does waiving the requirements work? It seems like we don't get our CSID/GIN login until after orientation, which is after class registration. So, we have to do our first quarter of enrollment without knowing the waiver results? I'm not 100% sure about what will be approved, so should I just assume that all of my submitted waivers will be approved, so that I don't sign up for an unnecessary class?

2. Is there any way to appeal if a waiver isn't approved?

3. The MS requirements page says that ""you can usually satisfy the requirement by taking a more advanced course in the same area."" Does this mean that I could enroll in, e.g. CS 157 (""Computational Logic"") to cover the foundation requirement for CS 103 (""Mathematical Foundations of Computing"")? (I feel pretty confident about the 103 content, but selecting all of the specific classes from my undergrad institution to line up for the waiver might be a pain.)

4. In the case of taking a more advanced class, can the foundation requirement class also count for another requirement for the MS? (e.g. counting CS 157 towards the foundation and breadth requirement)

"CS Transfer Schedule (2.5 Year, Systems Track, CC Transfer)",https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/1f51q6o/cs_transfer_schedule_25_year_systems_track_cc/,13,1,2024-08-30 17:59:29,"Hi!

I'm a transfer student transferring this fall majoring in CS. I just created a full schedule for my time here at Stanford (with the help of the reviews on reddit + oncourse) and I have some questions about it

For some background:

* I can and will transfer my credits for MATH 19 20 21, MATH 51 52, and PHYSICS 41 43 45
* I took PWR1 this summer so I just need PWR2 for my writing reqs
* My foreign language reqs got waived cause I was raised and went to highschool in foreign country
* I'm fairly new to CS (maybe up to CS106A knowledge at best). FWIW I think I got accepted cause of the hardships I've gone through cause I don't really have any experience/projects other than the CS classes I took at CC.
* It might be possible to finish my degree in 2 years, but I think it'd be so tough for me, so I feel like being late by a quarter would be best

My thinking process for my schedule:

* I want to feel/be ""ready"" to at least apply for internships by the time I finish my first year
* I want to take CS210 series cause people have been saying it's really good
* Since I've never taken a class at Stanford, I've no idea about the course load. So I limit myself to only take 3 CS classes a quarter max (and also check the total of weekly hours from Oncourse)
* Purple: CS Core Reqs -- Green: Systems Track Reqs -- Orange and Blue(AI/ML): Courses I'm interested in
* Extra Note (not sure if helpful): I **LOVE** sports, I would take a class that seems helpful for me in learning about the sports industry

Some specific question I have:

1. **Will taking CS 166/168 help me to prepare for interviews?** I might switch it with CS 142/193X and take it Spring Year 2 instead (if it's not significantly helpful in terms of interviews)
2. I heard bad reviews about CS 142 and almost all of them said to take 193X instead, however, Stanford doesn't offer 193X this year; **Is there any way to tell if Stanford will offer 193X next year? And is it still worth it to take CS 142 or should I just take a 193 series course instead?**
3. Winter Year 2 seems pretty packed to me at the first glance, but the total hours (based on Oncourse) is around 50-ish hours. **How doable do you think it is?**
4. Any course you think I shouldn't take / switch with a better course? in other words, **is you favorite CS course listed here?** Please let me know if not!
5. Any random thoughts about my schedule? **Or is it just dumb to plan this far?**

I would really appreciate and love to get any advice regarding what's good/bad about my plan, recommendation for classes, and also any advice in navigating through Stanford academic environment/community! 

Thank you so much in advance!! I really appreciate you guys' time to read all this LOL

- EE 227 - Robot Perception

- EE 263 - Introduction to Linear Dynamical Systems

I'm currently thinking of taking Physics 61 this fall (I have AP Physics C credit and was placed into 61 by the placement test), and then taking 71 and 81 in **sophomore** winter/spring. The reason I want to take 61 in freshman year is so I can get an early introduction to college-level physics, and figure out whether I enjoy it sooner rather than later.

So, my question is two-fold:

1. Is it okay to split up the Physics intro sequence like this? From my understanding, this is allowed by the Physics department, but would it make my life unnecessarily hard down the road when taking 71/81 in sophomore year?
2. If I **should** hold off on Physics 61 until next year, are there other courses or opportunities that I can pursue in freshman year that can introduce me to the Physics dept @ Stanford? (e.g. Physics 45 looks like one option, but it doesn't seem as interesting as 61.)

2. If you're a chem major or have taken the chem sequence: Would you recommend I take Chem 121 in the spring right after Chem 33 winter? Or is it ok/better to take Chem 121 in sophomore fall? If I take Math 51 in the spring I feel like that will be the ""hard class"" I should focus on, and taking Chem 121 + Math 51 would be overwhelming. Tbh Chem 33 + Math 51 might be bad too but a lot of people have done that
3. Bonus: my dorm has a lot of two room doubles so I think I might get one, is inner or outer room better? do you get to choose? I read inner is better for more privacy, but what if I wake up earlier than my roommate and me walking through their room disturbs them or something

Would you recommend taking both of these classes? I see they have the same format and instructor. If I just took CS129, is that enough for what I want to accomplish?"

pro-fro just realized he knows nothing about academics @ stanford,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/1euifm4/profro_just_realized_he_knows_nothing_about/,7,3,2024-08-17 14:01:07,"incoming freshman here! I realized that I’ve been so caught up with looking into Stanford’s social scene, student life, etc. that I haven’t properly considered what the transition between hs and college is like for academics. 

For reference, I did the IBDP (HL PHYSICS, ENG LIT, BIO + SL MATH AA, CHINESE B, ESS) during hs, and I found it alright. ig the content felt easy to digest, especially ESS and Math AA (never rly had to study for), but I procrastinate a ton which did make me have to cram for my HLs.

My questions are:

1. How does the workload feel in comparison to the IBDP or even AP?

2. For any former HL Physics students out there, how did the transition from the non-calculus based ib physics to physics at stanford feel?

3. For someone v unsure in what to major in, do you think there is enough time (before having to declare your major) to explore multiple courses w 0 prior knowledge throughout frosh year? Or would you recommend keeping options less broad and sticking to a pipeline w a clear progression?

4. I absolutely HATED IBHL English (AP LIT COMP as well) finish-in-one-class-essay-exams during HS, but I do enjoy analytical work when we actually have a good amount of time (at least like a week or so) to complete the assignment. Do the English/writing classes at Stanford have exams of similar testing conditions? If so, are they avoidable?

5. What is a manageable course load for my first year in terms of units? Roughly how many classes/quarter would you recommend, taking into account all the adjusting + if I wanted to have enough time for working out, excursions with friends, and recreational sports?

6. Do STEM classes like Physics, Math, etc. have formula sheets available during exams like there are for AP/IB?

That’s all for now. I’d really appreciate any input from you all!! Excited to join the farm :D"

Rising sophomore w/ questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/1epycfl/rising_sophomore_w_questions/,1,4,2024-08-11 23:10:45,"My computer crashed the first time I wrote this so I'll try to be more concise this time :').

**Context:** I'm a rising sophomore studying CS. I was a math major before but I've been doing a lot of thinking over the last few months and am quite confident in my switch to CS. I'm particularly interested in robotics/AI, and I have a decent amount of exposure in robotics (basic control theory, motion planning, etc.). As a result of me being a math major previously however, I've only completed CS 106B. This leaves me in my current predicament, and I am seeking some advice and/or feedback.

**Questions:**

* Should I focus on taking the CS core before moving onto grad classes? I am very excited to take some grad classes (CS 237A, 224N, 223A, 231N, etc.) as I find the material really interesting and would like to develop some knowledge in these areas maybe for Summer 2025 internships. Part of me is unsure if the work will be too much but another part of me is somewhat confident in my ability to keep up.
* Is it okay to take 161 before 103 and 109? I would take 109 simultaneously. My reason for potentially taking 161 beforehand is that I have some exposure to proofs already and I think it would be useful for technical interviews / OAs for internship hunting.
* I've heard that it's a good rule of thumb to do 2 hard classes + some combo of medium and easy classes per quarter. I've noticed that a lot of upper div CS classes that count for AI track (ex: CS 224N, 255, 259Q, 223A, etc.) are less hours per week on average than most of the core. Is it feasible to do 3 of these grad classes in a quarter + maybe a WAYs class?
* To add onto the previous question, I used this approach in previous quarters and I found myself really disliking the lighter and ""easier"" classes I took as I was very disinterested in their content and I felt like I wasn't learning anything useful. I feel as though I would have much rather taken a potentially more involved class that I could take something away from. Does anyone have any comments on this/recommend some fun & interesting courses for me to take?

**Potential course plans:**

* **Fall**
   * Option 1 (50 hrs/week): CS 109, CS 148, WAYs class/Introsem, CS 237A,
   * Option 2 (45 hrs/week): CS 109, CS 148, WAYs class/Introsem CS 161 
* **Winter**
   * Option 1 (54.5 hrs/week): CS 224N, PWR 2, CS 223A, CS 255
   * Option 2 (54.5 hrs/week): CS 224N, PWR 2, CS 107, BIOE 122
* **Spring**
   * Option 1 (55 hrs/week): CS 231N, HISTORY 95, CS 225A, CS 327A
   * Option 2 (50 hrs/week): CS 231N, HISTORY 95, CS 111, ENGR 76

Classes earlier in each sequence would be more inflexible to me, later ones are more elastic. Estimates are given by OnCourse. Any feedback or advice is super appreciated, thank you!"

To keep the story short, I was admitted as a foreign student in Stanford's MSME graduate program, beginning this Fall quarter. However, I found myself with a ""major"" issue regarding my transcripts to get matriculated. 

My institution is closed during the summer break, and I am unable to send my official transcripts until early September. While this does not seem to be an immediate problem (the Graduate Admissions informed me the deadline for receiving transcripts was September 23rd), not being matriculated seems to prevent me from login in the Vaden Health Portal and fill my health information, which is required to do before August 15th...

My understanding is that not being matriculated will prevent me from being enrolled and register for classes. Am I cooked? Or will I be able to do everything required when Stanford will receive my official transcripts early September? I would like to know if anyone has experienced or is experiencing this. Every bit of information will be gladly appreciated. I will of course keep updating this post if I have more information for anyone who would find themselves in the same situation.

Also that including the teachers everyone will look down on me, and that it'll affect me.

* i also have credit from ap calc ab and ap calc bc (both 5s)

i'm wondering whether i should skip directly into math 53 (and not take the diagnostic) or take math 51. im planning to take the diagnostic either way to see where i stand, but i saw that math 51 is pretty much a repeat of multivar and linalg, and im not sure if i should take that course again. how hard would math 53 be and what would yall recommend?"

Anyhow, they also claimed to have attended Stanford, we're talking quite some time ago though (70s). Thing is they've gone to some of the alumni events hosted in my city. I've never attended Stanford, don't have any affiliation, they told me they can invite a +1 to these events so I attended one. In a alumni event I attended, someone I've never met told me this person was untrustworthy and implied they may be LARPing.

In the end of all this, all I could think was ""what did I get myself into for being naïve"" but oh well. At my school, there's a student directory only students, staff and alumni can access. It shows you a list of all students currently enrolled and their contact info, and there's a separate list of all alumni that attended for at least a year, whether they earned a degree or not. From what I've heard, Stanford has something analogous. I would really appreciate anyone if they can help me confirm their affiliation or not. Thanks everyone!"

I also need to have time for CAPS counseling...) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/1e9bi7d/sophomore_unsure_of_how_to_proceed_at_stanford/,3,20,2024-07-22 11:05:19,"So I've decided not to give up on Stanford yet, despite a disastrous Spring quarter, as I once again withdrew from CS106b (had not submitted the first two assignments because I hadn't asked for support :( ), and even worse did not pass Math51. I am going to be studying a lot for Math51 during the summer, as I realized that it's mostly the textbook rather than the lectures that the exams (in which I failed miserably) are based on. Also, I'll be looking at past exams as well. Apparently there's a really bad curve for Math51 Fall. However, I don't seem to have an option but to retake it, and hopefully they don't downgrade, right?? I just need to pass, otherwise the NP will never be replaced.

I also need to make sure I won't be placed on academic probation, as I'm on a scholarship and I only passed 9 units in the Spring quarter. The only way for my CS major dream to not be completely destroyed is if I pass CS106b AND Math51 in the Fall Quarter now that I'll be a sophomore (hopefully it's not too late...). I also have PWR2 this Fall Quarter, so at least I have four units that I'll def. pass. The problem is that I want/have to take the ACE classes for CS106b and Math51 if I want to have a chance of passing, so that's 12 units, plus 4 PWR2 units=16, BUT I have to take as many units as possible, since if I don't pass CS and Math again (it's happened before :((( I will be placed on notice/probation/risk losing or even paying back the scholarship money.

The problem is what fourth course should I choose? It will have to be a 4 unit course, as they only approve of a 20 unit courseload. I'll also take an activity 1 or 2 unit course, as those do not need approval even if the total number of units exceeds 20, and if I don't pass CS and Math again I will have at least completed 9 units in the quarter (below 9 units you are automatically placed on notice. There's also another, very stressful regulation, that says that you are placed on notice if you don't complete 36 units in 3 consecutive quarters, and I have only 15 Winter quarter plus 9 Spring quarter :(

So, opinions highly appreciated on the following course options:

-CS106a. It's a 5 unit course, but I'm thinking that maybe because it'll be concurrently with CS106b maybe it'll get approved? Is it even a good idea to take them concurrently? I believe I can pass CS106b (I got 40/100 in the first midterm, which, believe it or not, is a passing grade apparently), but maybe CS106a can help me understand CS106b better, plus if I don't pass CS106b but do pass a then I'll also be able to use it as transfer credit if I drop out of Stanford (because there's no way I can stay here without a scholarship). Also, I see CS106a is a requirement for several non-CS majors. Is CS106a A LOT of work, for someone on a 21 unit courseload though?

-Design 1. If I don't pass CS106b and Math51, then my dream of majoring in CS will be completely destroyed and I'll have to look at other options. Design is one of them, and Design 1 is apparently a requirement in order to declare Design as a major. Also, it's a 4 unit course and is considered 'easy' in the sense that I can pass it. However, apparently you spend a lot of time on assignments; I don't care about the ones that I can work on myself, because I can adjust my time, finish my CS and Math assignments first and then do this (sacrifice my sleep if I have to), but does anyone know if they are group projects? Not sure how to adjust my time there

-A Technology in Society course. If these are writing courses I am certain I'll be able to stay up all night and get those units; it's exams that I'm dreading and apparently these don't have them, right? Also, it's a requirement for so many majors (though I think that for CS there's a Technology in Society course that also fulfils the Writing in the major course, so maybe it's best to wait and see if I can take it later, in the unlikely case that I do manage to follow the CS major?)

-Is there an 'easy', i.e. no exams, almost everyone passes, CS course that I could take? That would also help me in case I have to leave Stanford and follow CS at another university in my country (because, despite my failings, CS is what I want to do...). 

-Should I just choose a Science, Technology and Society course, which is not a major I want to follow, but I need to take into account what I can pass? (I've passed Math 21 and Physics 41)

tl/dr: Absolutely need to pass Math51 this time; My Fall quarter courses are Math51, CS106b, PWR2, a 1 unit Activity Course, but what should the 5th course be?

Sorry for the long message, but I'm really pressured into leaving Stanford by my parents because I had a difficult first year, and I'm doing all I can to stay here... Thank you"

We had accepted the need to downsize for my dream education at Stanford, but this housing assignment is causing significant concern. My wife works remotely from home, and with our dog, we really need just one wall to create a separate space.

I am an incoming community college transfer and had a few concerns regarding the placement exams. I majored in physics and math at my CC, and plan to major in physics at Stanford and pursue theoretical physics in the future. I aced the calc-based physics sequence at my CC (mech, e&m, and modern) as well as single/multi variable calc, ODE's, and linear. However, I feel that my CC did not prepare me well at all.

  
I've been looking at some exams from Berkeley for the equivalent courses from my CC, and I am very intimidated. Does anyone know what topics are covered on the physics and math placement tests? I really want to do well, but I am afraid my CC was too easy and did not prepare my enough.

  
That being said, would it be a suicide mission to start with the 60 series upon transferring, or am I better off starting with the 40 series? I want to be able to finish my degree in two years, but I also want to really learn the stuff and maintain a high GPA for grad school. Any and all help is appreciated!"

I would really appreciate any advice on how to pursue a career in PM like what internships should I do in the meantime, when does PM recruiting even happen and where do I find the formal applications, any popular/useful resources/guides, and what skills/networking do I need?

I'd also appreciate advice on whether or not I should go into PM, as I'm mostly just exploring my options for now. My reasons for wanting to do PM are that I like the tech environment as a whole and the people in CS at Stanford. Since I personally do not see myself enjoying SWE at all, PM seems like a cool middle ground that has good growth and compensation. My reasons for not doing it are basically just the possiblity of a bad market/being replaced, and also not wanting to do PM for a product/company I'm not passionate about, and lastly the opportunity cost of forgoing other careers.

Earlier this year, our advisor let us know that they will be moving to MIT in the fall. They gave us all the option of staying here and finding a new advisor or joining them at MIT. While I still have a little bit of time left to decide, I am leaning towards joining them. As it starts to settle in, I have decided that I am going to try and get a degree for my time here. It would give me a sense of finishing something and it would provide a good feeling after all of the exams and late nights spent on projects. I am a local and know that will be back on campus many times in the future to catch up with friends or go to a sporting event and I feel that during those times I am likely to have a sense of regret for not coming away with a degree from my time here. I have met a lot of great people here and really enjoyed the classes I took.

For getting a degree, one thing complicating this is that I already have a master's degree. There is something in our department called the degree of Engineer. However, my advisor is strongly against this as they think employers in particular in academia view this as an indication that the person failed quals. For that reason, I am leaning towards doing a second master's degree. This will require me to take 15 credits in the summer. My advisor did provide me with the option of staying for the Autumn quarter though I know they are opposed to it and I think it would be good to start at the same time as everyone else who I will be going through the PhD with since that's the best time to form valuable friendships for the journey.

I should only need 15 credits but may take 18 credits just in case. Based on what is offered over summer quarter, to get the masters I need to take any two of the following courses CME 106, EE 261, EE 263, CS 229, and EE 364A.

Aside from two of the above courses, I only need STEM courses 200 level and up and it looks like 6 credits can even be outside of engineering, math, and science (only need to be 100 level and up).

From looking through the courses for summer, these ones all seem like options.

EE101A

MS&E 140

MS&E 180

CEE101E

CEE107S

CEE176A

CEE273T

ME 344

ME 344s

I am looking to have the most manageable course load possible with 15-18 units which is a challenge and I would be very thankful for any advice on which courses might make this possible. The 6 credits outside of engineering, math, and science could be a good route to this but I am not familiar with which courses may help. I am particularly looking to limit the workload if possible because I would like to spend time on research as there is equipment at Stanford that I use for my work that I will not have access to if I leave in the fall and so this is likely the last chance to make progress on this particular project.

Any advice on courses would be of great help."

Probably Overplanning but Thoughts?,https://i.redd.it/yoh0evx5ih7d1.png,19,30,2024-06-19 07:53:43,"Hey y'all, as you probably read from the title I'm probably overplannig but I simply like being safe about things. Yes, admittedly it probably is a little crazy to start stressing about what courses I'd be taking this next 4 years without even having started my time at Stanford yet.

However, being the autistic son of a gun I am, I still wonder what insight current students can give into this theoretical 4-year plan I concocted for EE before I get in contact with my academic advisor soonish. And if there any things I may have missed in terms of correctly meeting all the requirements to graduate.

*Note: When making this 4-year plan I made 2 assumptions in terms of units and I made certain my plan met some requirements well.

1. I assumed that I'd be able to test out of 1 'language' class, given I speak/read/write Spanish proficiently.  

2. I assumed that I'd have some of my dual enrollment credit transfer over (yes, I did read the requirements and I only made this assumption on the courses that were listed as pre-approved to play it safe. Meaning I do have more dual enrollment credits, however those classes are not listed as pre-approved, but I feel some more than likely will transfer). Which is why the 4-year plan adds up to 175 units, plus the 6 I would get in general dual enrollment credit adding up to full 180 needed to graduate (that's if I'm correct in saying that ;-;).

3. I made certain the classes I chose helped me in fulfilling all the WAYS, PWR, and COLLEGE requirements. 

PS: Not really sure about how the time for all these classes would look like, nor the days. Don't feel like stressing over that much just yet..."

Question about Stanford Med School - Discovery Curriculum,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/1dd3gji/question_about_stanford_med_school_discovery/,2,6,2024-06-11 02:28:36,"Not sure if anyone here is at the med school, but just thought I'd take a shot and ask a question about it.

For the Discovery Curriculum at the Med School, it talks about how students can opt to take an extra year and pursue a masters degree. On the schematic it shows on the [website ](https://med.stanford.edu/md/discovery-curriculum.html)(when you click the drop down ""Discovery Curriculum Pathways"" and scroll down) one of the options states ""MD with a Master Degree in any field"". 

However, other webpages seem to imply that the only dual MD/MS degrees that Stanford offers center around research, epidemiology, public health, or business. 

Is the curriculum limited to these options, or is it possible to truly do any masters degree? Like I could pick something in education or the humanities?

TIA!"

Due to a series of health complications that have been documented (both physical health + mental illness) and the Advising Office is aware of, I've had terrible grades my first two years at Stanford, several failing grades, and only mediocre grades my third year (including one failed class). I plan to retake most of the failed classes, although two of them I can't retake, and in general now that my health issues have been resolved, my grades are finally starting to be on the up.

I am an international student on an F-1 visa, and I would like to stay in the US after graduating. I am studying economics. My GPA is currently around 2.3. I believe that by the *end* of my undergraduate career, I can get it up to 3.3 or 3.4. I've got excellent extracurricular accomplishments in university, good quality research, and good job interview performance. I've never been put on probation or such, because again, this is explained by health complications so I was excused.

What are jobs I should be looking at or aiming for? What are internships I should be applying to for the next summer, given my GPA probably has a ceiling on how much it can improve just in the fall during internship application season? What types of companies might offer me an interview given this fact? I can get doctor's notes, etc. certifying my health complications that drove academic performance issues."

The goal of the ""floating duck"" is to project an air of [sprezzatura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprezzatura), ""an Italian word that refers to a kind of effortless grace, the art of making something difficult look easy, or maintaining a nonchalant demeanor while performing complex tasks."" The description of the negatives of sprezzatura is quite on point in describing the downsides of the culture of Stanford in particular and Silicon Valley generally:

> Howard Wescott and other scholars have also noted the negative aspects of making difficult tasks seem effortless, namely, that in practice, sprezzatura involved an ability to trick people convincingly. Wescott states that Sprezzatura was, in a way, ""the art of acting deviously"", an ""art"" that created a ""self-fulfilling culture of suspicion"" because courtiers had to be diligent in maintaining their façades. ""The by-product of the courtier's performance is that the achievement of sprezzatura may require him to deny or disparage his nature"". Consequently, courtiers who excelled at sprezzatura risked losing themselves to the façade they put on for their peers."

stanford vs brown help!,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/1d5oq27/stanford_vs_brown_help/,24,51,2024-06-01 14:52:41,"hi everyone! i only have until sunday to decide (and i get how obnoxious it is that i’ve been stressing over this), but i was lucky to be admitted to both stanford and brown and was wondering your thoughts on which i should pick! for context, im planning on majoring in sociology and either computer science or econ.

some of my pros for stanford:
- probably the best computer science program worldwide if i end up deciding to do cs
- they have some super cool research opportunities for undergrads in sociology that i’ve seen posted on the soc website!
- quarter system, so i could take more classes (but maybe also a con: i’m a little nervous about ending school a month later than most other people, socially and internship-wise)
- marginally better name (for whatever that’s worth)
- california (yesssss sun)

and some pros for brown:
- open curriculum, so i could take literally whatever classes i want!
- i’ve seen online that brown is much more undergrad focused than a lot of other top schools, which i really appreciate
- i could double major much more easily (i think) than at stanford
- i’m more interested in the quantitative/research side of sociology, and they have a concentration called social analysis & research that seems perfect for me
- providence was so cute when i visited and i loved campus

and finally some of my concerns:
- i’m a little worried about stanford’s duck syndrome and imposture syndrome (already having a little bit of it even just for being admitted)
- i’m worried about the weather in providence bc i’ve heard it’s usually pretty rainy constantly and super dark in the winter
- i would like to have the ability to explore a city. i also really want to have the ability to see live music, and i’ve already been looking up concerts near both schools and they’re all either in san francisco or boston. so can anyone speak to how often they get off campus to go to the city/see live music?

i’m probably forgetting something too, but if anyone has advice i’d appreciate it so much!!"

Hey! Stanford '18 alum here. Inspired by research like this (source: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html), I’m crowdsourcing questions in the comments to put in a survey to send out to subreddits from universities around the country to see our similarities and differences. I’ll follow up with a finalized survey and results once they’re ready. I’m curious what info you’d be most interested in learning about from other universities. Some ideas for interesting stats to compare between schools: major/program choice, post-university plans, # of hours spent on classes / week, demographics (e.g. gender, race, household income, religion), political views, overall satisfaction with university, etc. Feel free to suggest and upvote other things you’d be interested to see in the comments."

He was class of ‘03. I know his full name and you do, too, but I don’t want to dox anyone. 

He scored varied victories: challenging the post office for pitching out junk intended for our mailboxes; and expanding the menu for the Treehouse at Tresidder. (Was either thing necessary? Starvin’ student burrito was all I could afford anyway.)

He had an illustrious undergrad career in psych—if possibly one born of nepotism—working with death row inmates and learning trivia about executions. Like the fact that they wipe the injection site to sanitize it. In a way, he was a Zim spirit-protege. (Maybe Zim was his literal mentor—can’t recall.)

He was a subject of parody for the Chappie: “I will put my evil inside you!” he declared. 

And everyone cheered when he was knocked out of the running for student body president. 

I’m hooked on canned espresso drinks because of him. Mike was giving away a box of them outside that popup Thai Cafe on the quad (between the math and English/psych buildings? Shrimp fried rice ftw!). It was summer of 2002. A new drink called “Starbucks Doubleshot.” I was biking by and filled my backpack with those cans, and once I’d exhausted his seed investment, they were available in stores.

I now order four 12-packs of them every 48 days, from Amazon. 

Now when you google his name, nothing but his Stanford legacy and crickets. 

He seemed poised to be an alpha plutocrat. What on earth became of the guy?

EDIT: Per LinkedIn… after his post-Stanford stint at Queens University Belfast, he moved to Hong Kong to earn his PhD. He eventually cofounded a company called Ephone Ltd, which provides a dialer app for Africa. He is also a Director on the board of another publicly-listed company. 

I found some boring documents online from the SEC. No photographs anywhere. 

Why doesn’t he have an Instagram? Or a blog? Why are so many of us elder millennials too stodgy to maintain (or at least abandon) the standard socials of the 2010s? 

Wish I could say I peaked in college like he did, but it was probably in elementary school for me. RIP, dreams. But may the eyebrows live on. "

I typically read very slowly and take considerably more time to ingest english (not that english isn't my first language, but I skip words and read words that aren't actually in the passage). I usually need to read a passage a few times to be able to really understand what it is saying. 

Now, over the years I've developed the patience to deal with this during self-study but I find it really hard during exams.

Is it that stanford attracts high achievers who expect competence out of themselves and so they expect the same from others? Are you guys just generally type A personalities? A lot of you supposedly also are not just studious but also have social ability. Is it that you guys have always been number one due to being type a achievers and you don't like not getting what you want?
