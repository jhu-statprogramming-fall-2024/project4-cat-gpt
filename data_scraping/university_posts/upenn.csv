I'm fgli and I regret starting uni knowing I don't have money and a bad support system. I don't focus on school bc I'm working for myself and back home. I'm so tired but I don't sleep.

I struggle to ask for help because I feel like I shouldn't even be here, especially because I took the leave. I used to be independent and have it together. I don't go one day without crying. I'm scared to tell any admin my thoughts in fear of what will happen. I've reached out to some of my profs to see what I can do but I may have to withdraw from one class because I missed a midterm worth 25%. I wish I didn't hate myself so much. I try and go to class and I can't shut my mind off. I'm thinking about how my family back home is counting on me. I try and keep my family and school separated but I can't. My siblings need me and I am in the US. I took my mom to a DV shelter last year before coming back to school. My dad doesn't call. I don't have family here. I work under the table. I just want it to be over. I've held down my emotions that I don't even know how to articulate myself anymore. I don't want people to think I'm a nutcase anymore. I lost all my friends when u went to the hospital for mental health. Please how long does it take people to recover. I just wish i mustered up the ability to ask for help sooner. I'm so tired."

I'm currently enrolled in a qualitative research methods course that requires me to do a final paper based on interviews I conduct. I want to write the paper specifically about FGLI students and how imposter syndrome affects us to shed light on this seldom-discussed issue at Penn. If anyone identifies as a FGLI student and wants to help me out, I will be conducting anonymous interviews about your experience with imposter syndrome as a FGLI student. No personal information will be taken, just an audio recording that will be transcribed. The audio recording will be deleted, all identifying information (ie. names, dorms, frats/sororities, etc.) will be omitted or modified with your permission, and you will be helping me shed light on the FGLI perspective at Penn!!!

Can I kindly have some advice on the following please?

1. I heard that it is unsafe to walk around after dark. Based on this info, what are the key places/neighborhoods we should be staying at during the study week?

2. Given that we have 2-3 days of exploring,  what are some of the key places you would recommend for sightseeing or food? Both in the area around the university, as well as nearby cities/counties. My group and I are okay to drive up to wherever, just that we have to be back by Sunday for our flight.

Any tips will be much appreciated and thank you all in advance!

P.s we are coming from Singapore, if there is any food or souvenirs that you guys will like, feel free to reach out!

Question about on campus recruiting and summer internships at Wharton’s MBA and EMBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/1gnxony/question_about_on_campus_recruiting_and_summer/,2,0,2024-11-10 10:21:12,"First off, I hope it is acceptable to make this post here. I assumed the best place to ask about a Penn (Wharton) course would be in the UPenn sub. If not acceptable, sincere apologies. 

Looking at Wharton’s MBA and EMBA comparison tables, it states that FT MBA “	Students have access to on-campus recruiting services for summer internships and permanent positions” while EMBAs “have access to career counseling, workshops, and career resources through the Office of Career Management. ***Internships are not available.*** Job search services are available for self-sponsored students and others who meet the eligibility requirements. 

I imagine this is because it is assumed that working EMBAs won’t be able to take a summer off for the internship. Assuming this was possible in my case, do you think it would be possible to be involved in Whartons on-campus recruiting for summer internships and permanent positions? 

Do you know of anyone that has been on their EMBA and actually done this?

I am a 1st-gen student, low-income with zero family financial support to tap into and certainly cannot afford private school, so also would love info on potential financial aid. Also the minimum wage in PA is nuts and that's terrifying.)

A bit more info: When my back broke I stayed in EU for four years teaching & tutoring, farming, making goat cheese and distilling white liquor from old fruits, then working with migrants crossing from the middle east to Europe. Came back to the US when the political climate was starting to boil my brain and got a federal gig working with migrant families in Oregon for four years, have now been a part-time alt ed teacher for middle & HS for 3 years. I sure am sick of west coast culture, would LOVE to live in Philly, and I've never before run across a program that piqued my interest like this one. But I've been so hesitant about being that Weird Old Lady in an undergrad program. I'm only 31 but I ain't gettin any younger.

CS Elective Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/1gjpbg8/cs_elective_advice/,3,1,2024-11-04 21:08:12,"Hi everyone! Next semester, I'm taking CIS 1200 and CIS 1600, and I have room in my schedule for one more class. I’ve completed my gen eds, and I noticed that NETS 1500 counts as a CIS elective and seems relatively easy. However, I can’t find the syllabus online, so I’m not sure what the coursework is like.

If anyone has taken NETS 1500, could you share your experience? Specifically, do you think balancing NETS 1500 with CIS 1200 and CIS 1600 would be manageable? I’ve heard that CIS 1600 is very challenging and time-consuming, so I’m cautious about adding too much to my plate. I’m not planning to take any other difficult or STEM-heavy courses this semester.

Thanks for any advice!"

Hey! I’ll be at Wharton on exchange this coming spring, and I’d love some advice on a few things:

	1.	Module Recommendations (does not have to be mods under Wharton!): Any suggestions for interesting courses that are fun, popular, or have a unique learning experience? Ideally looking for something that encourages being able to connect with classmates 

	2.	Making Friends: Any tips on which classes or activities are best for meeting new people, especially as an exchange student? Also, open to any general advice on navigating social life at Penn as someone new

	3.	Other Tips: Anything I should know about the campus, study spots, Philly life, or events I should not miss?

Thanks in advance, and looking forward to being a part of the community!

Hi! I'm a prospective math major and wanted to get some advice on my spring semester schedule.

I'm considering applying to an uncoordinated dual degree in Wharton for OIDD, hence the 0.5 cu class (I'm taking another 0.5 cu oidd class this sem and love it)
- Is STAT 4300 together with 4310 a good decision? Or should I switch out 4310 for a 2nd math class? I have fairly good STEM/stats background & am taking MATH 2410 this sem.
- Also, should I just take a whole Wharton 1 cu class (like oidd 1010)? Would that be weird as someone not in Wharton?

I loved Northwestern's campus and location more so than Penn's, plus I am a big sports fan and want to be able to go to football games, tailgates, basketball games, etc., which I know is not popular at Penn. Obviously, from this standpoint it looks like I should clearly choose Northwestern, but I'm seriously concerned about the social life.

I don't think Penn is leagues above Northwestern in terms of social scene, but all the people I know who attend there say they have a lot of fun. I'm just worried Northwestern is no fun, especially with the quarter system, which I'm told has students studying for midterms during week 2.

Also, before you comment, obviously social life is not the most important factor going into where I choose to apply! I just love both of these schools so much and am having a hard time picking between them, especially since I **have** to go if I get in. I just don't want to regret my decision. Plus, I really, really, REALLY don't want to know I wasted an ED at a school that I hate."

My parents said they are willing to pay for it if I get in (and I'll probably do my best to work or get internships to help them as well), but it obviously is a ton of money and will be a bit of a burden on them.

I would love you to recommend classes for me to take or advise me to avoid. It doesn't necessarily have to be related to my major could also be psychology, international business Chinese, Business Law, etc. I'd love to hear your thoughts.

From previous exchange students, my university database accredited FNCE203 - Advanced Corporate Finance at UPenn is the equivalent of a compulsory subject for my finance major at my university. I would appreciate it if people who have and/or are currently taking this class to give their thoughts and experiences. For example, is there a high fail rate, is this course hard. If I were to go to UPenn, I most definitely would be advised to take this subject abroad so I don't fall a semester behind, however If I fail I would be held back. That being said, If it's pretty hard, I might just opt in to take it at my home university next semester and enjoy my life abroad haha.

In terms of housing, I've heard popular colleges such as Berkley is extremely difficult to get as an exchange student as they prioritize existing students. Is this the same for UPenn? I believe it is a requirement for exchange students to live on campus and we get to choose out of 4-Year or Upperclass housings. "

Safeguarding and well-being versus equality and inclusion.,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/1ga8fqk/safeguarding_and_wellbeing_versus_equality_and/,2,0,2024-10-23 11:43:06,"I apologise for asking, and I know this probably could be phrased better. I've started a Masters course here at Penn. During a undergrad course in the UK the University I was attending had several students with autism both on the course and through study abroad programs from here in the US. 

The UK does have laws to ensure people with disabilities are treated equally, but the University has an obligation to safeguard the rest of the class as well as the other students as a whole. One of the students with autism within his first year developed a reputation for cornering and inappropriately touching other students(touching of the chest, backside and crotch without consent) the University refused to do anything about this even when the police were involved. 

Once such situation actually occurred in a classroom which had a CCTV camera where my entire class and the deputy course leader witnessed the event. I'm curious to know if any of the students have had similar experiences, and I'm curious to know how American universities handle this kind of situation?"

Hello! I am a sophomore in CMPE. This is my revision to my last plan because ese 3010 was cancelled for this semester.

What do you think?

I know it is a bit too much. For reference, I am now taking CIS 1210, CIS 2400, ESE 2150, ESE 2000 and LGST 1000.

But it is one class less than last semester, and I feel like those classes are going to help a lot with my job search. Also, I want to take ESE 5320 next fall, and I think I will greatly benefit from all of these.

What do you think?

Thank you :)"

Is UPenn Wharton or SEAS (CS) a better fit for me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/1g3y242/is_upenn_wharton_or_seas_cs_a_better_fit_for_me/,1,6,2024-10-15 02:58:22,"Hi! Basically, I'm a current senior who's applying to UPenn through Early Decision this cycle and I can't seem to decide whether I want to apply to Wharton or Penn SEAS as my second choice (I'm applying to **M&T first choice**). I have interests in both business and computer science. Here are some of my extracurriculars (related to business/cs):

* A web-development business I started that has revenue (this is kind of cs and business?)
* Built a software for highschool students; had to market this on social media and I got other highschoolers to help me with it
* I created my own MOOC and hosted coding workshops for students
* Interned at a college counseling firm
* Just some general web development projects
   * Like some AI software I've made in the past
   * Also working on an education-related startup which is kinda legit? (it was top 5 on product hunt 😃)

I think most of my ECs are aligned with computer science, but they have a few business elements in them. However, one of my goals throughout and after college is to build and run my own successful tech startup and for that, I'll need to learn the fundamentals of entrepreneurship, economics, funding, etc.

Also, I believe Wharton is better on ROI if I'm not wrong? My family is in that range where we don't really get much financial aid, but also going full-pay is a pretty big burden, so I'd like whatever education I receive to set me up best for what I want to do after a college (of course, I understand that I'll need to put in just as much effort as well, it's not just the program that carries me!).

Sorry for the yap, but I'd love any input on this small dilemma atm! ED is due in 2 weeks\~, so I don't have terribly too much time. Ok, thank you and bye!!"

Is it possible to specialize in Computer Graphics in the MSE CIS program?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/1fxjuw6/is_it_possible_to_specialize_in_computer_graphics/,3,3,2024-10-06 16:02:35,"Hello, I'm an international student applying for the MSE CGGT program for Fall 2025.

My primary interests lie in CGGT, but I heard that you were allowed to apply to multiple programs, so I thought I should apply to CIS too since it seemed like I could take most of the courses provided by CGGT during a CIS program anyway.

However, after searching some more, I found out that the [CIS/MSE Degree Requirement Page](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/mse-in-cis/requirements/) mentions that ""Concentrations for CIS/MSE are available in the following areas – Computer Vision, Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Software Foundations, and Theoretical Foundations."", and that there are only menus for the DMD and CGGT programs under the Education bar in the [CG@Penn](http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/index.html) website.

So my question is, since a specialization in computer graphics is technically provided in the CGGT program, is it discouraged to choose it as a concentration in the CIS program, or is it not even possible to begin with? Would it be pointless to apply to the MSE CIS program intending to specialize in computer graphics?

Is it case by case or on a rotation like it is for nurses? Is it possible to take a day or two of the Special Winter Vacation off and then be there the rest of the time?

I would have no problem banking the time and then using it within the 90 day period you get if you have to work it, but I just want to know how it works because it is rare for a university library system to be open during a vacation period when the vast majority of the institution is closed.

It started off well and I was doing fine, I also try to put in more work seeing how I'm struggling, but for one of the assignments I worked for over 8 hours, went to office hours and still didn't do as well as I should've. I'm not sure what more I can do, but my worry is that even if I put in more work, get tutoring, and extra help in OH, my results so far have already set me up for getting a bad grade, which will inevitably bump down my gpa. It sucks even more because I took this class seeing how it is an introductory one and wanted to get some basic knowledge, but now even the effort I'm putting in my other classes will go to waste, seeing how the homework makes up so much of the grade for this class. Initially I talked to my advisor and wanted to do P/F, because I plan to major in Econ so it wouldn't be required for me, and she said I can put it down as such as long as it's used as an elective. When I went to submit my form, it didn't give me the option for CIS 1100, so now I assume the class might have a specific no Pass/Fail rule, which ruined my plan.

So for some context, my girlfriend went to Penn years ago. We recently did a walk through the campus on our way to dinner in West Philly and she showed me a few of the buildings where she lived/took classes. One of the places we stopped by was the ""biopond"" (I *think* it's the James G. Kaskey Memorial Park but specifically the pond). She reminisced to me about how she used to sit out by the pond and enjoy the nature/the silence as a way to just relax and unwind. She seemed to really enjoy being back and remembering her times spent there fondly.

I had the thought that I could try to get a painting of the biopond and gift it to her for Christmas. The issue being that I cannot for the life of me paint or draw at all. I honestly wasn't sure the best way to try and find local artists that I could commission for the painting but I figured it was worth just posting it in the actual subreddit and seeing if anything turned up. So if any potential artists would like to reach out or learn more don't hesitate! Or maybe if you happen to know somebody who might be interested even if they're not a student / alumni that would be interested in the work that would be great too. Thanks y'all! "

"Accepted ED applicants, do you regret not (waiting) for potential scholarships @ other T20 schools (Vandy, UVA, Emory)?

If you are ED accepted, that  means either 

1, your parents are able to afford price easily 

2, you matched with questbridge and got a full scholarship.



 In the case of #1, you guys think Penn is worth it? Assuming it's not your ""dream school since the age of 5"", assuming you just went for the prestige. **If you're able to be accepted ED to penn, then you're definitely on the caliber to get full rides (such as corenlius vanderbilt @ vandy, woodruff @ emory, Jefferson @ UVA, etc).**

 So do you really think being full PAY at penn (if you fall under scenario 1) is worth over full RIDE at a T20 school like vanderbilt or UVA? Do you regret doing ED and wish you would've considered other full rides if possible (at amazing T20 schools)?"

Why Do Many UPenn Students Handwrite Notes in Class? How Do You Use Course Notes? Curious International Student Here！,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/1f9nk98/why_do_many_upenn_students_handwrite_notes_in/,20,11,2024-09-05 14:14:20,"
Hi everyone, I’m an international grad student at UPenn. Back in my undergrad, I rarely saw anyone using paper notebooks for note-taking; most people used digital tools or annotated the provided materials （e.g. Slides) directly. However, since coming to the U.S., I’ve noticed that many students here use paper notebooks and handwrite their notes, which is quite different from what I was used to.

I have a few questions and would appreciate any insights:

1.	Why do many students choose to write notes in a separate notebook instead of annotating the professor’s notes directly?

2.	Most courses here provide both slides and notes, which is different from my undergrad experience(without any notes). How do you typically use these notes? Do you review them before class, or are they mainly for after-class study?

Struggling to find a good fit for me and need opinions on location.

The schools I looked at so far are: University of Cincinnati, Boston University, John Hopkins, UPenn, MIT, UMiami, Emory University.

I’m originally from Rhode Island and I’m at University of South Carolina currently. The main thing is I really want my car with me, I don’t have it in SC and it’s so difficult to go anywhere. So I’m okay with doing a like 15/24 hr drive since I can do a two/three day trip, but I also don’t like driving in difficult/congested areas. Right now I really like University of Cincinnati since they have a great program but I know nothing about the state. It seems like you can get good jobs after graduating so that’s helpful? Also I don’t want it to be crazy expensive.

Does anyone have any recs for other schools for PhD in neuro that aren’t ivy league type ones? A lot of schools that have neuroscience are superrrr difficult schools, which I can definitely do but I don’t know if they’d accept me as I’m also struggling to get real life experience for my resume, so I want some backup/realistic schools.

I don't qualify for any of the other options for common app waiver except this one:

You can provide a supporting statement from a school official, college access counselor, financial aid officer, or community leader.

According to this, it could be anyone else from the school as well. Or a community leader. Has this been successful for anyone? These people won't have access to CommonApp. So can they just directly email it to UPenn admissions team.   
  
Also, when I download the waiver form, it looks like this and only mentions ""counselor certification statement""?

At my undergrad school back home, this wasn’t a common thing—people didn’t really crowd around the professor after class.

To all the new freshman who are struggling ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/1f0pi04/to_all_the_new_freshman_who_are_struggling/,190,18,2024-08-25 05:52:36,"I’m seeing a lot of freshman posting here who are sad and can’t find friends. It makes me so upset seeing these because that was me 2 years ago. I wanted to give some lessons and advice.

Lesson 1: Penn does not give a fuck

The university simply does not put in any effort to plan anything to help freshman meet people. I’ve toured other unis and they always had speed friending sorta events. Penn does not give a fuck, you are on your own. I hate that it is that way but that’s just the reality and that doesn’t change for the next 4 years. You need to be proactive in every aspect of your life here. 

Lesson 2: Understand the type of people who get into Penn

Yes, they will be competitive. A lot of them super rich. A lot of them from prep schools. Most of them r super extroverted. A lot of them r gonna seem like complete spoiled jerks. So if you don’t come from that kinda environment it’s gonna feel weird. Give urself some grace to adjust. If you get bad vibes from someone, still be cordial because they might be friends with someone that u actually like.

Lesson 3: Parties

If you aren’t a party person, there isn’t something wrong with u. Go to a couple, you don’t have to drink or do anything crazy. U r a freshman everyone is expecting u to be awkward. Just never ever just sit in ur room. It’s better to roam the hallways or locust. This is true for all 4 years of Penn. The more u overthink things, the more depressed u will be.

Lesson 4: Classes

You will fail an exam early on. Just plan for it now. It will happen. It happens to literally the best students here. On the first day of classes, introduce urself to the people around u cuz u won’t get another chance later in the sem. Most people here meet their closest friends in classes, not their dorm or parties. 

Lesson 5: Clubs

Hot take but 90% of them r complete bullshit. Do not spend ur weekend applying to clubs. Pick a couple that r open membership or have a very short application form. If you are coding up an operating system for a club application you are doing it wrong. Once u r in the club, prioritize meeting people over being someone’s slave.

Lesson 6: Dorms

Penn isn’t the type of school where people will just be playing board games in the common area. Don’t expect ur RA to organize anything. Pick an event (doesn’t have to be a party) and ask people to go with you. 

Lesson 7: First week friends 

The people you meet in the first week r prob not gonna be ur friends for 4 years 99% of the time. But the friends of those friends could be. So meet as many people as possible. Don’t cling on to your “group” and stop meeting people because that group will dissolve in like max 3 weeks. 

Lesson 8: Penn Face

It isn’t gonna be like high school where people r super down to earth and r honest about what they r struggling with (at least in this NSO stage). There is an inherent competitiveness to the people here and that’s how they got in sometimes. A lot of times the people here were the nerds in their hs now they wanna be the cool, social person. Everyone is still figuring it out, have confidence in urself.

Lesson 9: Things to stay away from

Don’t look at the social media flexing. Mute them, block them, do whatever you have to do. It will destroy you mentally if you are already feeling down. Also stay away from internet gurus who try to convince u that there is something wrong with u because u haven’t made friends as fast as u hoped. Also just avoid people or things that completely compromise your values. 

Lesson 10: Have some confidence

You are at one of the best institutions in the world. You are already him/her. Think about the average person at your high school…yeah they suck compared to you right? Engaging in the internal hierarchy within Penn is a waste of mental energy. Each day here is a new opportunity with the right mindset. 

Hope this helps, I’ll add more as I come up with stuff. "

can anyone recommend good worldwide online extracurricular activities if you’re going to major in biology or are going into the medical field, or just good extracurricular activities in general? my school is an early college highschool n i’m in their health sciences pathway, meaning we don’t have sports and clubs are my only hope, but they only just added clubs and they only have 15 max. i’m also thinking about starting a club of my own, but i don’t have any ideas yet except kpop club. 

from what i know, they also only have 2-3 or 3-4 ap classes which i already know i will be taking. anything else i can do to better my chances as far as extracurricular or volunteering? (i’d also appreciate it if anyone gave me club ideas) "

I'm considering enrolling in ESE 5390: HW/SW Co-Design for ML, but I've found limited information about the course online. I’m particularly interested in understanding how well this course bridges the gap between software/mathematical foundations in ML and the practical hardware implementations.

For those who have taken or are familiar with this course, could you share your experiences and insights? Specifically:

* Does the course effectively integrate software and hardware aspects of ML?
* How deep does it go into hardware setups, and how does it complement the software and mathematical foundations?
* Would you recommend it for someone looking to strengthen their understanding of ML from a hardware perspective?

Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

i am a prospective student (pls don’t leave the page yet lol) and i had a few questions about housing. it may seem like im getting way too ahead of myself but you’ll see why it’s important.

so i have a condition which makes me unable  to eat basically everything and with my condition, i know i cannot fully sustain myself on dining hall food (ive heard upenn’s isn’t even considered that haha). 

i still hope to go to college, (fgli represent🙈), and i wanted to ed to wharton this cycle. 

now that you know my back story.. here’s my question:

what dorms have personal kitchens? i know for freshman only dorms it’s pretty limited but when talking to the disabilities staff, they said they had multi-year dorms with kitchens. 

the problem is that the staff highly stressed the concern of social isolation if i go into those b/c i wont be with the majority freshman community and my eating differences already put me at a disadvantage socially.

is there feedback i can get on this? anyone with similar experiences & restrictions? i would still love the sort of traditional dorming experience w/ a social aspect, roommate(s) and activities but i want to know if i can achieve that with my condition. 

i also know the dining plan is mandatory so im planning to get the one with more dining dollars so i can use it for groceries. 

anyway, i am only asking this prior b/c i dont want to bind myself to a school that cannot accommodate for me. even tho upenn is my dream school, i do have to eat to survive haha.

i genuinely cannot do communal kitchens (or bathrooms but that’s just a preference lol, another topic for another time) because i would have to use the kitchen multiple times a day as my only source of food.

thank you so much for reading my long post, my PM’s are open and i would genuinely appreciate any comments pertaining this topic  :) "

What's the point of a business degree for software engineering jobs / getting a M&T dual degree and then becoming a software engineer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/1ediyh1/whats_the_point_of_a_business_degree_for_software/,13,9,2024-07-27 15:27:56,"On LinkedIn, I've seen a bunch of UPenn M&T grads (engineering + Wharton business dual degree) work as software engineers after graduating. They work at companies like Facebook/Meta, Amazon AWS, and even some smaller startups.  Don't want to share any names here but DM me and I'll share a few profiles if you're interested.

You don't need a business degree to be a software engineer, only a computer science degree. Why do people join the M&T program and get a business degree only to work as a software engineer? Unless they want to be a product manager or something (which is not the case for the people I'm referring to), I feel like a Wharton degree would be useless for software engineering. Wouldn't they be better off just taking more computer science/engineering electives instead of getting a whole other business degree?

Maybe I'm ignorant and downplaying the importance of a business degree for software engineering roles. If I am, I'm sorry. But I just feel like M&T students who graduated and went on to work as software engineers wasted their time with a business degree. Of course, if they later on decide to be a product manager or create their own company, that's one thing. But the people I'm referring to graduated from UPenn M&T years ago and have only been a software engineer ever since. Why would they get a business degree if they're not even going to use it? "

I was looking to see some average stats of applicants to this program at Penn. I see online that they advertise that the minimum GPA to be admitted is 3.5, however, I would like to know what is considered competitive. I also would like to know if the process is holistic or not. The reason that I asked if the process is holistic is because previously I was not a great student during my first associate's degree, however during my second one (nursing) I received straight A's and was in my school's chapter of the Alpha Delta Nu Nursing Honor Society.

I am enrolled in an RN to BSN program at the University of Alabama and will graduate in Fall 2025.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, as I have a strong affinity toward Penn and it would be my absolute dream to complete my graduate studies there."

I'm an incoming freshman in the fall, planning on majoring in ESE. I'm a little panicked with the section description of ESE 1110, since it says to ""join the waitlist."" I'm kinda confused since it's an intro class, and it doesn't have any outstanding prereqs, yet I think I have to make a permission request and fill a form in Waitlisty?

Is it fine to have the class in my primary cart without a PR, or would I not get the class in that case?

Any help would be appreciated."
