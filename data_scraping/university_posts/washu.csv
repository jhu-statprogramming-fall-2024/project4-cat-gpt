2024-2025 Prospective Student Megathread,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1fs5svk/20242025_prospective_student_megathread/,17,19,2024-09-29 14:37:25,"**Hey everyone,**

**Prospective students: please post your questions here instead of in its own post, especially for FAQs.**
With the college application season underway, we wanted to create a space where we can consolidate and centralize questions from prospective students about WashU. 

On our sub, we are lucky to have many current students, alumni, faculty/staff, and parents who browse and engage. These individuals may graciously answer your questions about WashU from their anecdotal experience and knowledge. This is an invaluable way to answer your specific questions with the first-hand experience of WashU-affiliates. 

Please note, the vast majority of people here do not work in admissions and do not know the real processes for admissions and reasons why people get admitted. We also largely lack knowledge about many other schools, with exceptions. Therefore, we are not well equipped to help you with certain questions, specifically “chance me” and “school vs. school” questions. Please, if you have concerns related to these, contact your high school's college and career counselor and/or Admissions Officer or contact the [admissions@wustl.edu](mailto:admissions@wustl.edu) email address.

Supposed to graduate this semester. Dude has been dealing with so much stuff last few months, dad got cancer, sole earner of the family and still young, he has been spending half of the time traveling to india to take care of his dad while also keeping with studies. 

He told me today he had some kind of meeting and that he might get suspended from school for something which is not his fault. Something to do with unfulfilled tuition payment but i don't know much details. Starts crying and telling me how much of a disappointment he will be after spending all the money and time and still not being able to graduate.  Tells me can't show his face to anyone back home if that happened and what would he do with his life. 

Been talking with him a lot and his mental health has been concerning to me. I feel like he might take a drastic action and harm himself. And I don't know how to help him. I don't know much about what's going between him and washu. 
Is there something I can do to help him open up and take on therapy or something. Does washu has mental health support? 

I also want to do it anonymously cause don't want to break his trust. Idk if he has told anyone else what's going on with him and I would hate myself if he stopped talking to me. 

If you guys have any suggestions, please reply. I just can't get the thought out of my mind that he might do something.

I’m a senior looking to apply ED1 and my superscore is going to be 1480 (740/740)

Can anyone give me some perspective on this? I’m feeling anxious about admissions and need to know whether I should submit. I feel like my studying would have been wasted if I don’t, but I definitely do NOT want me submitting to hurt my application.

This semester, I am taking SDS 494, which was originally Math 494 before the split between the Math and Stats departments. 

The newest undergraduate bulletin states that:

Students may count courses from the Department of Statistics and Data Science (SDS) as Mathematics courses if at least one of the following conditions holds: a. The course is cross-listed in the Department of Mathematics (e.g., Math 493C and Math 495C are cross-listed versions of SDS 493 and SDS 495). b. The student matriculated in 2023-24 or earlier and the course was previously offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, as reflected by the student’s matriculation-year bulletin (p. 16).

Since I attended the school in 2021, I believe SDS 494 should count toward my math minor. HOWEVER, I checked my **WUarchive**, and it seems that this course is not being counted toward my minor. I am very concerned about why this is the case. Is it a bug or something? Has anyone encountered similar issues?"

Update 9/9/24
I received an email from HR today. 

This is not a WU specific policy but FMLA protocol. Please see https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/28l-fmla-spouse. 
FMLA is the job protection piece of your leave, which is the part you would be ""sharing"". You are eligible for 6-8 weeks of maternity (depending on type of delivery) which will be paid at 100% of your base pay after the first week (elimination period) and 4 weeks of Caregiver, also paid at 100% of your base pay. If you have a regular delivery, you will use 2 weeks of vacation for compensation to total your 12 weeks of leave. 
Your husband is also eligible for the 4 weeks of Caregiver.
We have Non-FMLA leave that you or your husband can apply for to bridge the ""gap"" that's not covered by FMLA. Non-FMLA is not job protected but an agreement with your department to allow you to take that time away from work. Please contact [redacted] to start that process. 
Please also reference:

My customers have skewed much older than I anticipated, maybe because I opened at the beginning of summer, but I just haven't really seemed to reach much of the college crowd with my social media marketing efforts.

Is there a place I could pin flyers or business cards? Hand them out? Any online platforms you'd recommend? My wife went to WashU around 2010ish, but didn't live on campus and kinda kept to herself, so she wasn't sure. 

I don't want to pester anyone, but I think it might be useful for people (and want the exposure for business, of course). The few college guys that have come in have been pretty enthused about it.

I always feel awful popping in and telling them I/we have the room reserved for that time for a zoom meeting, studying, etc., and they’re usually pretty annoyed about it especially if they have stuff all over the whiteboards, but I’m also like…If you reserve the study room you plan to use, you’ll have exclusive use of the room and other people won’t try to come in. If I reserve the room a couple days ahead, I have no idea anyone’s going to be in there when it’s time because the slot is vacant. I’m also pretty sure the Hillman study rooms are explicitly for Brown students and students from other schools can’t reserve them, just like we can’t use Olin or Law study rooms. And in Hillman, the screen outside the door shows when the room is reserved for the day so there’s no surprises. 

This wasn’t really an issue at my undergrad since you had to swipe into study rooms after reserving them. Anyone have any advice for asking to use a study room that you’ve had reserved for days without causing potential conflict and dirty looks? I genuinely hate conflict and confrontation. "

The apartment is newly constructed and it comes with amenities such as a sauna, outdoor pool, lounge, and gym. Most of the residents are WashU-affiliated students and faculty so it is a great environment.

If you tell them that they messed up or ask them where your order is, you get shamed or yelled at. Good luck getting a refund, too. WashU dining literally scammed me out of $150+ in missing items, missing add-ons, and missing orders in the past 3 years. I am typing this currently while waiting 1+ hour for a GrubHub order at the Village, which I may have to just abandon as I have a committment at 3PM (order placed at 1:15PM). Worst dining experience, ever."

Since there’s really no restaurants immediately surrounding campus like my undergrad, it doesn’t leave many options. 

Where do students who aren’t living on the south 40 eat dinner? It’s a bit of a culture shock as my undergrad had a food court open til 10pm and three dining halls with one open til 7, one open til 10, and the third open til 10 then open again for late night from 12am-2am.

I took Rhetoric and Power last semester and loved it and loved the professor.

Essays are only 6 throughout the semester and the last one is literally just one you already did before but revised/written in a different style. You get entire classes where you workshop your essay drafts with a partner before submitting it and if you don't like how it turned out, there's a policy where you can revise two of your essays and resubmit them to replace the grade and on the third time you do it, it's the average of your two scores.

As cliche as it sounds, the next 4 years will go by so quickly, so please take time to enjoy it all.  I met so many amazing people and had so many great opportunities through WashU, but it wasn't until I started to put myself out there a little bit more.  Seriously, if something (a class, club, job, whatever) seems interesting or moderately fun, go and try it.  You never know who you might meet or what you might find.

Same goes for orientation.  I know parts of it are boring, but I legitimately know people who remained best friends for 4 years with people that they met during orientation.  Don't be afraid to strike up a conversation or invite people to go with you to one of the optional activities, they're probably just as nervous to meet people are you are.

Anyway, just some thoughts I was having while passing by campus today.  Good luck, WashU '28!"

A Cappella @ WashU FAQ,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1etd2xt/a_cappella_washu_faq/,12,2,2024-08-16 02:01:51,"Hey y’all! I’m a recent grad who loved being in a cappella and I’m also hella Type A, so here’s an insanely long masterpost of questions I had or have been asked. This post is not endorsed by any group—it’s just me sharing what I know.

# Can/should I audition if I’ve never sang in a group before?

**Yes!** Every year, people get into a cappella even though they haven’t been part of a choir or anything similar before. If you’re in this camp, I would recommend practicing warm-up scales, since they can be confusing if you’ve never done them before. Any video of “warm-up scales” on YouTube will work well to see what they’re like.

# How many groups should I audition for?

**As many as you’re interested in!** Although you can only join one group, you’re encouraged to audition for as many as you can. That being said, there are a lot of groups, and doing a bunch of auditions (and hopefully callbacks) can get exhausting quickly. It is always okay (though unfortunate) to reach out and cancel or reschedule an audition or callback. Take care of yourself, first and foremost.

# How many groups are there at WashU/how are they different?

There are currently **13 groups** recognized by ACAC. (ACAC stands for A Cappella Advisory Council, and it’s the governing body of a cappella at WashU.) **You can see the intros for all of the groups** [**here**](https://acac.wustl.edu/groups/)**.** A 14th group (focusing on Gospel music) was created last year. Their IG has been radio silent this summer, so I don’t know if they’ll continue, but you can check @/wuupraise to see if they announce anything.

# How should I choose which groups to audition for?

In my opinion, **the best way to learn about the groups is at the ACAC Showcase**, which happens in the first two weeks of classes. (This year, it's Sunday, Sept. 1 at 7:30pm at Graham Chapel.) There, you get to hear every group sing one song—plus there’s usually free ice cream! Before then, you can chat with most of the groups (and get first dibs on auditions slots!) at **the Activities Fair**, which is on the first Friday of classes. If you’d like a head start or want to know more, look online: a lot of the groups have a strong online presence on Instagram, YouTube, and Spotify.

# Can/should I audition for [insert ethnic-interest group]?

**Yes**, everyone is welcome to audition! You don’t need to be Asian to join Sensasians or Jewish to join Staam, etc. You just need to be interested in singing with people from and learning about that group’s culture!

# What does it mean when a group says they compete?

Competing can refer to any a cappella competition, but **usually refers to ICCA** (yes, that’s the competition featured on Pitch Perfect). Competing involves creating and rehearsing a very polished, 10-minute performance and performing it alongside other a cappella groups from the area. Groups and individuals can get awards for performing well in various ways. You do not need to be competitive to enjoy competitions. Often, groups find joy and fulfillment from crafting a performance that is more complex and well-done than anything they’ve done before. **If you prefer a lower time commitment, you will probably want to prioritize groups who don’t compete.**

# Which groups compete?

Groups who have competed in the last three years are **After Dark, Amateurs, Mosaic Whispers, Sensasians, and Stereotypes**. (Please let me know if I’m forgetting any—I’ll edit the post.) No group competes every single year. The decision of whether to compete in a given year is made by the group after new members have been welcomed into the group.

# Which group is best?

**You need to make a decision for yourself** which group is best for you. For example, Amateurs and Mosaic Whispers are generally the most time-intensive groups to be in, as they compete fairly often (an average of every other year) and generally make it to the second round of ICCA, so they have two competition weekends per year instead of one. All competing groups tend to be more time-intensive than non-competing groups, but all groups are a big commitment. Social environments of the different groups vary widely, and your best bet is to **get your own vibe check from your auditions and callbacks** so you can find the place you feel most at home.

# Can I audition as a sophomore/junior/grad student, etc?

**Yes!** Sophomores routinely audition for and get into groups. Juniors, seniors, and grad students are welcome to audition, and I’ve heard of all three getting in, but it tends to happen less often. I recommend auditioning regardless of your situation.

# Can I audition again if I didn’t get into a group last year?

**Absolutely!** People routinely get into groups their second year auditioning. I’ve even heard of someone getting in on their third time auditioning, though that’s very rare. Sometimes, people get into one of the groups that originally rejected them, but I’d recommend casting a wider net so you have better chances this year.

# When are auditions?

Every group holds auditions in **the first \~2 weeks of classes**. Auditions could start as early as the first Saturday after classes start, so check the ACAC website for this year’s schedule when it’s announced. The fall auditions schedule is coordinated by ACAC, so every group has the same timeline of auditions/callbacks/decisions. **This year, auditions are the second week of classes, including the Monday (Labor Day).** I would recommend keeping your schedule relatively free on Labor Day and the following weekend, if possible.

# How do I sign up for auditions?

All of the groups will set up their own online scheduling form, and you will use these to sign up. Once it gets closer to auditions time, you can usually find links to these forms on the groups’ IGs/Linktrees, their websites, and/or in person at the Activities Fair and ACAC Showcase.

# What are auditions like?

**TLDR:** Chill, welcoming vibe. The only necessary prep is choosing a SHORT solo (approximately 30–45 seconds or a verse and a chorus). Check your Spam folder the morning after auditions end.

**For those of you who want to know specifics:**

Auditions vary by group, but I’ll try to give a play-by-play, with the caveat that these are all generalizations, and you don’t actually need to know this info. Just make sure you’re checking your email and following any instructions you receive.

First, you sign up for a 10–15min time slot via each group’s auditions sign-up page. You will probably get an email confirmation that allows you to reschedule or cancel your audition if need be. You’ll probably be instructed to arrive early to your audition to fill out some paperwork. Schedule your auditions with plenty of time in between, because auditions tend to run late, and you also need to incorporate travel time and meal time and that sort of thing.

You show up early to your audition (yay). If it’s your first audition, you’ll fill out an ACAC form that asks for things like which groups you’re auditioning for and what your conflicts are for callback days. For most if not all callbacks, you’ll fill out a little form with basic info like your name and some fun get-to-know-you questions. They’ll probably ask for your voice part—no worries if you don’t know! The group will choose which voice part they want to call you back for anyway. They’ll probably also ask if you have any experience doing VP, which stands for Vocal Percussion and is basically just beat-boxing for a cappella.

You’ll start your audition! You’ll start off by chatting with the group for a minute or two. I felt very welcomed in my auditions! Everyone’s really excited to meet future new members and they’re nervous about making a good impression. That being said, these are also extremely long days for group members (sometimes basically 10 straight hours of hearing audition after audition), so if they all look dead, it’s not you. They’re just exhausted.

They may ask to take a picture and/or a voice recording to help deliberations run smoothly. AFAIK, you can always say no if you’re uncomfortable for any reason.

You’ll then do some basic warm-up scales (again, search on YouTube if you don’t know what these are) and some tonal memory. Tonal memory is just repeating back notes, so they’ll play like four notes in a row and you sing them back as best as you can on any vowel, syllable, etc.

Then some groups will offer sight-reading, and this is generally optional and very low stress. No group requires everyone to be a good sight-reader, it’s just nice to see your level of familiarity with reading music. You can say no, but I would encourage you to give it a shot.

Then there’s your solo! This is my favorite part of auditions, and hopefully you’re excited to sing the song you chose too (even if you’re nervous). Try to enjoy it and show off what you like about your voice!

Lastly, you’ll wrap up with another little chat, maybe a super short activity. If you have any questions, this is a good time to ask, but TBH most questions can either be answered online or can wait until callbacks. The audition is not an interview—you are not expected to come with questions, so only ask them if you legitimately have them. If this is your first audition, the group will read off an ACAC-wide spiel that has info on callbacks and what to expect going forward. And then you’re done!

Callback decisions and times are announced in the early hours of the morning after all auditions wrap up. You’ll get emails notifying you of instructions for your callback or telling you that you unfortunately didn’t get any callbacks. You may need to check your Spam folder. Each group will also post their callback list on IG and usually on the doors of BD as well, so you can use those to double-check you didn’t miss anything.

Callbacks vary more widely by group, but generally it will involve learning some of the group’s music and singing it with them, and it will also involve more getting to know the group. Take this opportunity to try to get a vibe of the group to help you rank groups on your pref card. (The pref card system will be explained to you by ACAC.)

Hopefully, within a few days after your callbacks, you’ll be accepted into a group! If not, some groups hold spring auditions, and auditioning again next year is a great option too.

# What song should I choose for my solo?

The best song will be **the one you feel most confident singing**—one that you feel really **shows off what you like about your voice**, whether that’s a big range, beautiful tone, great dynamic contrast, etc etc etc. You will probably want to choose a song you know well (to decrease stress and make you feel more confident), but if you don’t know all the lyrics, that’s totally okay. As far as I know, all the groups are okay with you having the lyrics up on your phone as you sing.

# Will I get into a group?

**It really depends** on which groups you’re choosing to audition for and whether you happen to fit what they’re looking for. I would recommend auditioning for all the groups you’re interested in and hoping for the best, but don’t go in with any expectations. I wish I could give specific numbers, but since I don’t know the audition numbers for other groups, I have no idea what percentage of auditionees get into a group.

# What advice would you give to auditionees?

* **Sing a good amount in the week/s leading up to your audition!** I didn’t sing at all the summer before I started college, and it showed in my voice. I made sure to sing in the shower a lot that week haha and that helped me get my range and comfort back. If you’re in a traditional dorm or otherwise embarrassed about people overhearing, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/ci89qy/music_practice_rooms/) has a good list of practice rooms on campus.
* **Avoid things that will ruin your voice!** There was a Pitbull concert right before auditions like two years ago, and a bunch of people came to auditions with their voices shot. I’m not saying don’t go to a concert, but maybe don’t scream your heart out while you’re there. Also, try to avoid getting sick. Sometimes we can work with it (hearing past the sickness and/or doing a virtual audition), but you’ll always have a better shot with a healthy voice. Lastly, consider your alcohol intake. Alcohol will make your voice do things you don’t expect, even after you think it’s left your system. Consider taking it easy, especially the several days leading up to your audition/s and/or callback/s.

That’s all I’ve got! I hope this post helps someone. Please feel free to comment with additional questions, additions, or corrections. I hope you find a home in WashU a cappella!"

Hot Take: the school should have been completely renamed instead of rebranding ,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1etut5b/hot_take_the_school_should_have_been_completely/,0,16,2024-08-16 17:30:24,"Being named Washington University was dumb at our school's conception, and it's still dumb now.

1. We have no connection with George Washington at all - it just happened that his birthday was the same day as when we signed the charter?
2. Washington was a symbol of unity at the time (immediately before the Civil War) - but that just doesn't really make sense anymore - he's farther along in our history now and has been viewed differently in some contexts

We're named after someone we have no real connection with? Why don't we rename after people who were important to our university, like Danforth University or Brookings University (2 people who helped boost the reputation and resources of our school)?

I understand that it is rare for colleges to rebrand due to names carrying prestige/reputation, but our name itself doesn't really carry that much reputation in regular culture. Only certain schools like Ivys and Stanford have that name-recognition. And the fact that we always get confused for either being in Washington (state or DC), or UW itself, significantly fucks with our recognition.  It's that much harder to build our reputation when we have to overcome this confusion with UW or whatever - if we rename, we can still build reputation but without having to be confused with anything Washington-related.

And adding on (in St Louis) to our name just makes us seem like not an original school or something - like we need some modifier because we weren't first or something. Harvard doesn't call itself Harvard in Cambridge, Duke doesn't call itself Duke in North Carolina, etc. We should just be the first and last of our name, no need to qualify where we are. The best names have their reputation precede them. 

The one caveat is if we could suddenly, and dramatically, build up a lot of cultural recognition/profile, that our reputation supersedes this disastrous naming. If UPenn wasn't so historical and well-known, students there would probably be very peeved to have to explain that their school isn't a state school every time (although I'm sure this actually STILL happens). That's our situation, though. Unless we made a dramatic shift to like the number 1-3 university in the nation (which probably won't happen with how these college ranking sites work) and increase our cultural cache (which just takes a very long time), I don't think our university will ever fully defeat the plague that is this confusion with anything Washington-related."

Maybe stop asking about crime so much on here?,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1erse71/maybe_stop_asking_about_crime_so_much_on_here/,107,24,2024-08-14 04:17:46,"Hey, slightly annoyed alumn here. I get the whole moving to a new city your unfamiliar with thing, and sure St. Louis isn’t a holy utopia…but can you all please please please listen to the students and alumni in this subreddit and in St. Louis’s subreddit when we say that WashU and St. Louis are safe. A lot of people seem to assume the second you step off campus or cross the loop you’ll get shot or something. Yes, crime rates are higher here. Yes, sometimes crime happens near campus. I’m not saying it doesn’t. That’s unfortunately the case in any city. However, I can’t help but feel that there are racist and classist undertones to the way many people think about this. I know I’m not the only one who feels this way either. 

Campus is safe, the surrounding area is safe, public transit is relatively safe. You just have to have awareness of your surroundings, not leave your apartment door and windows open like you do in the suburbs, maybe not dress head to toe in designer everywhere you go, and maybe not be alone if you’re going to be out and about at night. 

There are plenty of posts here and elsewhere to answer your questions related to crime and safety. It’s okay to do your research and to have concerns, but this near-constant conversation based on assumptions of crime based on a few crime rankings and media perception paints an image of this city that many of its (predominantly Black) residents do not appreciate at all. 

This is more of a call in than a call out. As guests in this city at a university that historically has caused just as much harm as benefit for the St. Louis community, we need to do better. This goes to prospective students too. I’m not saying don’t ask questions, but please consider what assumptions you’re making or images of St. Louis you’re perpetuating. "

Best Laptop for Design and Arts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1eip3rv/best_laptop_for_design_and_arts/,3,4,2024-08-02 23:55:07,"Does anyone have recommendations on what laptop to purchase based on school requirements? I'm an incoming freshmen currently in Arts and Sciences and planning to potentially switch to Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts instead.   
One issue I've noticed is the display requirements for Design and Arts, which much of the laptops don't have. These are the two options I've found, though I'm not entirely sure if they fit the requirements (can't find Radeon/NVIDA (4GB memory) graphics anywhere).

I was planning to use Missouri's Sale's Tax Holiday and the Technology Grant, but the two ""qualifying"" laptops all exceed the price for sales tax exemption (apparently only laptops that cost $1,500 or less are eligible) and the grant. Should I even bother with the requirements this year?

Financial Aid Issue (help needed),https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1ehygch/financial_aid_issue_help_needed/,4,8,2024-08-02 02:06:59,"Hey, I need some help and advice. I am a rising sophomore at WashU, and last year I was able to get my health insurance covered by them because I am a pell eligible student. My financial advisor even told me ""Any student who is at all eligible for the Pell Grant will have the health insurance covered by the school"". So when I got my financial aid package for this semester, I thought this wasn't going to be an issue because I am still a Pell Grant eligible student. So once I got my award letter I contacted my financial aid advisor about the grant, and this time she said ""The only option that we have for students is to use the health insurance grant that unfortunately you are **ineligible** for as a precondition requires that the total family income is **less than $75,000**. Last year, **Pell was the only qualifier** but as of the 24/25 year, Pell is **no longer the only consideration for the grant**"". I am unsure as to why all of a sudden they have added more qualifications other than being Pell-eligible (family income wasnt even a factor last year). The only other option my family was given was to fill out the financial aid award reconsideration form, but nothing significant has changed with my family's income that warrants me having to fill this form out. We are not in a place to pay the money necessary and were wondering if anyone was familiar with WashU's financial policy when it comes to this stuff, or if anyone just has some advice to get Washu to cover my insurance (or just make them give me more money in general). Any help/advice would be appreciated! "

I'm a rising Junior who got into WashU originally wanting to do Cog Neuro + CS, but halfway through sophomore year I decided I wanted to transfer to Sam Fox and do a BA in Design with a minor in CS.

I'm currently waitlisted for 2D Design (first on the list, with Wassenaar) and Intro to Human Centered Design (29th on the list, with Kelleher) and I'm wondering if I should email the professors asking them if I can be admitted into the classes.

I know with CS people get picked off the waitlist and people drop within the first two weeks but it's the only CS class that I'm interested in that fits with my schedule so I want to try to secure a spot.  For 2D, I'm not technically a Sam Fox student (I haven't officially transferred yet), so it makes sense that they wouldn't initially pick me off the waitlist, but I figured if I explain my situation I could get in.  I talked with my professors from the studio classes I took last sem and I need to take at least two studios a semester or I'll have to stay an extra semester (which isn't the worst thing but I'd prefer not to ofc), and all the other sections have a longer waitlist.

Do y'all think I should email the professors within the next week, or wait until the semester actually starts?  Since it's still summer, I'm not sure if they'd even be checking their emails but I get really anxious about this stuff so I'd rather know sooner than later whether or not I can take these classes or if I'll have to rearrange my schedule.  Thank you!

  
EDIT: I just got picked off the waitlist for 2D seven minutes ago??  Super happy about that of course-- I would like to thank God and any other spiritual beings looking out for me at this time 🫡 If it somehow had something to do with this post, thank you to whoever!! <3"

For reference (and some anonymity), I currently have a higher role within a university-paid job doing marketing and publications. I also have an internship this summer at a corporate HQ that involves creative marketing and communications strategy. I have taken Calc III and CS131, I try to make my credit load as heavy as possible (18+ credits a semester) and I currently hold a 4.0. However, I am unsure if I should be joining any professional frats / consulting clubs as I tend to have a lot more knowledge in media production, journalism, and marketing, making me think that may show better commitment and ROI for employers instead of following a more traditional path. For the record, I like marketing, management, microeconomics, and political science.

I would like to ask current students and alumni of the Bio program and McKelvey school of engineering for bme a couple of questions.

For context, I’m planning on applying as a biology major under the genomics / computational biology track.

What’s the difference between the different pathways and would you recommend doing a specialized major like genomics and computational biology or just going broad? Also is it like an actual major or do you apply as a biology major and then you declare your track?

Does the difficulty of admissions differ btwn schools and how easy is it to switch between majors and schools? Especially for impacted majors and schools like biology, cs, and bme.

Also for alumni, what do job prospects typically look like straight out of WashU in the bioinformatics/bme fields? And how easy is it for current students to gain research experience as an undergraduate or get internships? 

And lastly, what is the overall school environment like? Is there a lot to do in the neighborhood and how are the student interactions? Is it cutthroat and hostile like UC berkeley or are the students more helpful and collaborative?"

I'm considering living on-campus if I can scrape together enough funds, and would want to live in res communities with fewer freshman (ie off the south 40, presumably), as I'm coming up to 22 years; but it just occurred to me that maybe most upperclassman who live on-campus are all close friends with each other already? How receptive are non-freshers living on-campus to making new friends? Do they tend to just stick to who they know at res events etc?

And overall is living on-campus worth it, socially speaking? The events look fun and community seems strong there, so I wouldn't want to miss out on meeting loads of people (and generally getting that notorious 'college experience' thing too) if I lived off campus. But if its not such a big deal (especially off the south 40) then I'd rather save myself heaps of money and live elsewhere.

Off Campus Housing/ Roommates- Have I left it too late?

I've tried the usual places (washu owned, parallel, quadrangle, craiglist, fbook groups) but to not much avail. 

I saw someone saying that most flats and sublets become available in the fall (so, august I assume?) and that the best thing to do is stay in an airbnb or something when I arrive here in august, and wait for places to be listed? Is this true? Or are cheap 1 bed apartments/ sublets always few and far between? At my home uni, theres usually lots of listings of students in a shared furnished flat who have one more room they need to fill- is there an equivalent to that here, or a time when that probably kicks off?

Top 10 Characters You Will Meet at WashU,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1dp15gn/top_10_characters_you_will_meet_at_washu/,114,42,2024-06-26 15:19:05,"Obviously any college you attend will have a diversity of people. To use an Office example most people will be normal people more akin to Jim Halpert than Dwight or Michael Scott. That being said, just like in the Office there will be many characters for sure lol. Here are the top 10 most common caricatures you will meet at WashU:

1. The insufferable premed - As premed is the most common major at WashU (at least freshman year) you will meet many of these for sure. They will obsess over their grades and you may observe an argument break out here and there between them and a TA or professor the first time ever they get a B or even an A-. They will brag constantly about their future as a ""neurosurgeon"" and will make many passive aggressive remarks about people in any other career path. They will also brag about how little sleep they get and how stressed they are, as if hardship is something to be proud of. As these ""future neurosurgeons"" hit rude awakenings in the form of Gen Chem and eventually Orgo, they will gradually becoming quieter and quieter and when they subtly change majors after getting Cs they will then brag about their career change and why they were smart enough to realize ""medicine is not for me."" Unfortunately, there will be some who will talk the talk and also manage to walk the walk and get good grades and eventually get into med school. Sadly, these people will stay insufferable premeds and will grow up to become the arrogant doctor everyone in the real world hates.

2. The prestige whore - These people are constantly obsessed with their status or their perceived lack of it, due to ""no one having heard of WashU."" They will know the top 50 schools in US News and World Report by heart and in order and will obsess all the time about ""where WashU is ranked."" Rather than appreciate that WashU is a great school that is very selective, with average applicants in the top 1% of test scores and GPA, they will bemoan that they are not at ""a real school"" like Yale, Columbia, Duke or any school they feel the average joe is more likely to have heard of. They will constantly brainstorm branding tactics as if they were WashU's marketing department, often pushing the decades-long rumor of WashU's name change to ""Danforth University"" as if that will instantly solve all of their problems.

3. The East Coast/West Coast douche - Lots of overlap with 2 here (and some extent 1). Obviously not saying all East/West coast WashU students are like this and most aren't. But some will constantly be bragging about how much better ""California"" or ""Boston"" is than the midwest and they'll dunk on St. Louis any chance they get. They will often exaggerate how fun the coasts are, making it seem like they are 24/7 non-stop parties where no stores or restaurants ever close, and make St. Louis seem like a third world country. Often times, these people are not even from somewhere that different than the WashU area. They may be from the Boston area but they are from a suburb of Boston, and thus they are not even that familiar with Boston itself as a city. But they will play on the ignorance of Missouri locals so you think they are Mark Wahlberg or something.

4. The Olin Future Corporate Bigshot/""Next Zuckerberg"" - These are the business school students who are either majoring in finance or entrepreneurship. Similarly to 1, they will brag all the time about how smart they are and how they are destined for success, but in a different way. Their focus will mostly be on how they are so innovative and will be so rich someday and that only they are smart enough to think of the next Facebook or TikTok or something. Or they will obsess over all the top IB banks/boutiques or consulting firms that they know by heart, and glorify corporate America culture. They will often brag about how much money they are making off their stocks or random passive income schemes, and likely are omitting any failures from these conversations. Don't be surprised if they whip out their Robinhood portfolios on their phones completely unprompted just to show you ""how much bank they are making."" Some of these people will overlap with campus poker groups, and as the years go on they may begin to include Vegas trips and gambling winnings as part of their bragging.

5. The completely out-of-touch fabulously wealthy student - These are especially represented amongst international students, but not only. Many students at WashU will come from very wealthy families. Most mean well (though some will consist of 1-4 above) but most are also completely clueless about just how wealthy their families are and how much they take that wealth for granted. You will hear many Marie Antoinette-esque ""let them eat cake"" statements but 21st century versions. These students will drop hundreds of dollars or even thousands on a whim on expensive services for everyday conveniences that most middle class people would never consider. Private laundry services, expensive uber trips to far destinations, grocery delivery services, expensive clothes, just to name a few.

6. The ultra-religious nut - Religious diversity is great. In OP's opinion, religious and spiritual belief can overall be a good thing, as it can give people peace of mind, a sense of purpose in life, and sense of physical and spiritual community. However, some of these religious groups will very aggressively proselytize. They will insert religious references and scriptural quotes into everyday conversations completely unprompted. Rather than seeming just devout, this has them come off as fanatical and obsessed. These people will also often feign friendliness with you (often completely out of nowhere inviting you to coffee or lunch) when they really could care less about you, they just want to convert you to their cult.

7. The bitter ""under-achieving"" valedictorian - Overlap here a bit with 2, but not necessarily. These WashU students had it all in high school. 4.0+ GPAs, perfect SAT scores, they thought they were destined for Harvard or Stanford or MIT. They drew the short end of the stick though when they saw every application stamped with a ""rejection"" and had to ""settle"" for WashU. These former high school superstars are super bitter and have a huge chip on their shoulder. It often comes out in the form of bragging about their high school achievements and frequent complaints about how WashU is beneath them. Ironically, these bitter and entitled attitudes estrange them from the rest of the WashU student body and cause them to therefore have a poor experience at WashU and their bad experience at WashU becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

8. The Wannabe Jock - I'm just gonna go out and say it. WashU is a nerdy school. It may not be MIT and filled with DND dungeon masters, but let's just say most WashU students were not exactly captain of the football team in high school. So while it will be rare for there to truly be jocks at WashU, it won't stop many people from trying. These will be students who have some semblance of athleticism and enjoyment of sports who now see themselves as a big fish in a small pond, athletically speaking. They will super play up their ""jockness"" and ""athletic personalities"" to now try to come off as one of the cool jocks on campus. In high school they probably were not even that good, probably rarely getting passed to in pickup basketball games, but now at WashU they can be king of the nerds on the court. To use an NBA example, Brian Scalabrine during his heyday was considered the worst NBA player hands down, but when he left the NBA to play in Italy he was LeBron James-level dominant. Same concept at WashU.

9. The Wannabe Cool Kid/Party Animal - Similarly to 8, many WashU students were studious in high school and therefore not necessarily part of the ""cool crowd."" Many people therefore who were considered ""losers"" in high school will now try to use WashU as a chance to be ""cool."" These people will often try to attend as many parties as possible (often at the detriment to GPA and any premed ambitions from 1) and will brag unprompted about how drunk they got last Friday night, or openly brag about their marijuana usage. The single time they managed to hookup with someone will also be frequently publicized to anyone remotely in their social circle. Many people freshman year will at first think this person is pretty cool and fun, but then will realize gradually that he/she is actually just extremely insecure and has tons of baggage from high school.

And lastly, but most importantly!...

10. The Normal Kind Midwesterner - Last but certainly not least. While the above caricatures will all be experienced, at the end of the day most people will be this. Nice, humble, and smart students from the midwest who are just happy to be here and trying to make the best out of college. To be honest, it is because of 10 that characters 1-9 are allowed to exist. In other places in the world people may not put up with their bullcrap, but the average Midwesterner is polite and kind so those characters feel they have free reign to act out. Due to 10 though, WashU overall is a relatively unpretentious place, despite having such a smart and accomplished student body and being consistently ranked in the top 30 (and usually top 20!). It is because the average WashU student does not put on airs as much as his peers at similarly academically-regarded schools that WashU is not seen as similarly prestigious as say the ivy league. Most WashU students though wouldn't have it any other way. Even if students 1-9 would disagree.

Hope you enjoyed and feel free to agree or disagree with any of the above or add on anyone I missed!"

WashU is hands down the most beautiful campus I've ever seen,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1do6kxx/washu_is_hands_down_the_most_beautiful_campus_ive/,158,42,2024-06-25 13:54:36,"I've seen many colleges too. A close second is Princeton (and the architecture of both schools share many similarities). Most other colleges don't come close. Harvard in particular ain't all that and it was a religious school once so it is intentionally plain I think. Columbia if it weren't in NYC would not be impressive either as the whole school is congested into just ten streets.

I know I'm biased but imo more people should be applying to WashU based on the campus alone. Aesthetics play a big role in quality of life and few schools match WashU in terms of quality of life imo. People talk about Dartmouth as if it's this quaint wonderful community but it is still in the middle of nowhere. WashU is that but also has a city, St. Louis, as a resource.

Issues with Robert’s Realty,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1dookow/issues_with_roberts_realty/,12,5,2024-06-26 03:10:39,"Hi I was just wondering if this is happening to anyone else or has happened to anyone who has rented or is renting from this company. 

So we signed a lease in February. The lease was supposed to start on June 1st. 

At the end of May, Andy contacted us and said there would be plumbing being done so it would take until June 5th or 6th. I told him that our lease starts the 1st so why can’t I move in then. Then he asked if I could move into another unit until mine is done. 

He said it was only going to take a week. But this was every time I asked him. He keeps saying ‘waiting for the plumbing permit’… ‘waiting for the electrical permit’ but it looks like (as per online) that the permits were already given. The latest permit was issued 5 days ago and it’s been almost a month. 

Oh did I mention that the unit was not properly cleaned? I woke up at like 4 am the first night I got here. I had to pee and I stepped on glass! I started to wear shoes in the crib and one of my shoes had a thumbtack that went completely through the sole. It is the same type of thumbtacks that were left on a bulletin board when I arrived. 

Another thing… was not notified that water was going to be turned off for a day. Was only notified because I was walking inside and Stl city workers asked if I lived there and that the water would be turned off. 

Just wondering if anyone else has had this experience. It’s almost been a month and I’m irritated because I’m paying for rent, the electricity for my unit and I’m not even living there. And I have not fully set up anything because I feel like if I do, it’ll be the day he says it’s time to move in. "

Biology, chemistry etc. But I was a humanities major at WashU and I felt it was pretty mid tbh. I actually transferred to WashU from a lower ranked school (I'm a late bloomer) but I didn't think the quality of WashU's teaching in the liberal arts was that great if I can be honest. I even preferred the professors at my lower ranked college. I get that WashU is more bio focused but still, when I was transferring in WashU was ranked like 12th overall so I was expecting more of a well-rounded school. It did not feel like an ivy league caliber education to me.

Besides the professors not being great teachers, many of them were very smug and one even had kind of a god complex. He wrote some famous book and now thought he was king of the earth. I won't name names but let's just say in particular the medieval studies department is quite problematic.

I'm not sure if I'd say I regretted transferring to WashU, as the dorms, food, campus, community, and people were all wonderful. I had a great time in everything but academics. Sadly though, a school is ultimately about academics so I found that a glaring weakness. Did anyone else find their department at WashU disappointing as well?"

Does it cost extra money to forgo a semester of college to graduate a semester late? CAN I EVEN TAKE A WHOLE SEMESTER OFF AT THIS POINT?

My options for architecture are

2. Architecture for non-architects (3 units) spring sem

I wanted to take the second one since it seems like less time commitment and applies to all 3 minors in sam fox that i’m interested in. However, they aren’t open till spring. I’d really like to take architecture classes this fall to see whether i really want to pursue the path since i don’t have any background in it.

Now idk if i should 
A) take major req courses this fall and try architecture in the spring
B) try out architecture this fall with 2 courses for my major and see how it goes

""WashU has extended its test optional policy for applicants for admission through the fall semester in 2024. Applicants have the option of whether to submit standardized test scores. Students who are unable to or who elect not to submit their test scores will have the requirement automatically waived and will not be penalized. For those who do submit test scores, either SAT or ACT scores are acceptable, and neither the writing section nor SAT Subject Tests are required. Test results from any of the student's high school years are acceptable and we consider only the highest individual scores, whenever they occurred. Students may also submit additional testing (such as SAT Subject Tests, AP or IB exam scores, or other forms of testing) in addition to, or in lieu of, the SAT or ACT.""

First Year Math Decision - What Do I Do Chat,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1ddqo6t/first_year_math_decision_what_do_i_do_chat/,3,8,2024-06-11 22:10:33,"Hey everyone, I'm having a bit of trouble deciding which first year math sequence to take. I took and got a 5 in AP Calc BC freshman year, took Calculus 3 at a neighboring HS sophomore year, and took Lin Alg and an introductory Diff Eq course through CC my junior year (senior year I did IB math SL). 

From what I can tell, my options for first-year math are really Calc 3 or the honors math 203-204 sequence. I know my Calc 3 background is really strong, so I would actually kinda hate to take it again. On the other hand, 203-204 is better but still repeats some knowledge I already have while being more of a pure math course than I might want (hoping to maybe pursue double major in PNP and Applied Math, you can tell me if that is a stupid idea). The other avenue is if I was somehow able to place into a different math course, but I am unclear if this is possible or even a good idea since the courses I might skip are taught more rigorously at the university level. I am going to email Dr. Thornton and ask about what might be the best decision, but I'm posting here to see what might be possible or a good idea to try. Extra zany placement test? Instant expulsion and transferring to Hogwarts?"

My first year here, many people did not know what it was. I thought it just wasn't as popular everywhere else. One day, I saw some girls using rifles on Mudd Field so that made me feel there may be a few people that would like to join. 

I'm currently going through the process of starting a club and getting funding for equipment and such. I'm planning on using the first year to get established, and maybe perform at games.

Why so much hate for WashU in this sub?,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1d12t74/why_so_much_hate_for_washu_in_this_sub/,101,65,2024-05-26 14:39:38,"I've seen a lot of people on this subreddit complaining about WashU and saying it's overrated and its ""drop in rankings is well-deserved."" Idk, what are your thoughts on this? Students and alums? A lot of grievances I'm reading online are things like WashU only has a few elite departments, it doesn't have good brand recognition, it has a higher acceptance rate than other elite schools, it's in a bad city, and it games the system to be ranked highly. But my thoughts on these:

1. Few elite departments - Sure WashU is mostly elite at premed, bio and bio-related fields, and architecture, but what college isn't like this? Northwestern is only elite at journalism after all, a dying field btw. Carnegie Mellon is only good at engineering and business. Brown and Dartmouth aren't elite at anything. I think it's already impressive that WashU is exceptional at the fields it's good at. I would put premed/bio at WashU up with any university in the whole world. Can you say that about not only the two ivys I mentioned, but also Notre Dame, Vanderbilt, or Emory?

2. Bad brand recognition - You're right, most people outside of the midwest haven't heard of WashU. So? The average person hasn't heard of 90% of good colleges. Most people outside the midwest think UChicago is an average state school. Many people get UPenn and Penn State mixed up. If you say you went to Northwestern people may say ""oh Northeastern? I love Boston."" Many people think Notre Dame and Michigan are just football schools and if you say you went there they assume you're just a party kid. Even if they've heard of your school it won't stop people from having the wrong opinion of it. ""Cornell/Dartmouth are the easy ivys."" ""HYP have grade inflation."" Who cares what dumb people think?

3. Higher acceptance rate - Who cares about acceptance rate? So WashU is at around 10%, that's pretty low imo, and other elite schools are more like 5%. Michigan is like 17%. Would anyone say Michigan is not a world-renowned university? Northeastern is at like 6% just because they are in Boston and because their name sounds like Northwestern. Acceptance rate is overrated.

4. It's in a bad city - First of all, I disagree that St. Louis is a ""bad location."" I actually think it's a really underrated place with fun stuff to do and friendly people. But I will concede that it's not the most fun city compared to large metropolitan cities like NYC and Chicago etc and it does have high crime. So? Is WashU alone in not being in a ""fun"" city? Yale is in New Haven, CT, also a small and poor city. UChicago is in South Side, Chicago, a very dangerous part of Chicago and far from the center of the city. Cornell is in Ithaca, NY, a boring and cold AF place. Dartmouth is in literally middle of nowhere New Hampshire. I could go on and on, but I would take St. Louis over all of the places I just mentioned. I do not think WashU is in a bad location, or at least it is not a bad location relative to its peers.

5. WashU is only highly ranked because it gamed the system - Sure, WashU spammed its advertising to get more people to apply and increase its ranking by lowering acceptance rate. But if it's so easy to do that, why doesn't everyone do it? As the adage goes, if anybody could do it, anybody would do it. The reason why WashU's marketing campaign succeeded is because it is indeed not a well known brand name. Do you apply to University of Phoenix though just because they sent you a flier? Heck no right? But people applied to WashU after seeing marketing materials because they saw WashU was a good school and many wound up deciding to attend despite being previously unfamiliar with it. Just like how non midwesterners had to find out during senior year that University of Chicago was not some mid state school.

Besides, even if you don't buy my take on this, EVERY college is playing gimmicks to boost its ranking. Remember how Columbia got busted last year for fabricating data to leapfrog to #3? Do you really think WashU is the only school trying to fudge data to jump to a high ranking?

I don't really get all the hate. It seems a lot of people who graduated WashU may have had some bad experiences either there or after graduating and are taking it out on WashU for some reason thinking things would've been different had they gone somewhere ""better."""

They are not need-blind for waitlist students as they want students that will pay the full amount which would be \~84k. Currently I am applying for financial aid, but I'm not completely sure if I'll get too much, the household income is around \~200k(though my parents are both in debt as they both are paying off loans from each recently buying a house(they're divorced)). 

I put my deposit down for DePaul and I have to pay around 34k to attend, which is still so much, and neither of my parents can pay for it which means I have to take out loans. I'm not extremely excited about going to DePaul either I was just pressured by my mom who wants me to do their 7 year accelerated med program.

As of right now, I'm really considering just not applying for financial aid for WashU and paying it all; yes I will have to pay so much more, but I'll get to be closer with my parents(and can live with them after the first year), their campus is literally so beautiful, be with friends and already involved in the community, and also, if I pursue medicine then the pay back will be a lot better than DePaul. I'm seriously considering this, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or knowledge."

parking in east end for undergrad?,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1cyoblh/parking_in_east_end_for_undergrad/,0,7,2024-05-23 09:01:13,"So last year i had a car and was really annoyed practically all year long having to pay like avg. 10 dollars each day just to come to school and park bc i live off campus in CWE. Plus, there would be a lot of days where visitor's lot is full and I'd have to go all the way to the DUC garage which was pain in the az.  

I'd really want to get a permit for the upcoming school year, but most of my classes are in the east end and apparently when I was browsing through the parking website the yellow permit for east end, which is considered Zone 1, is only available for faculty + staff.  

So for undergrad commuters, do you guys really pay the visitor fee all year long, esp if you are in Sam Fox/McKelvey? Or do you guys just pay for the yearly yellow permit and park in Zone 2? Ever since I got a 30 dollar ticket for parking in Forest Park I have ptsd of leaving my car in the wild + also would hate to see my windows broken in (actually had a few people I know experience this last year which sounds wild). 

Also, the there is not even an option to buy the commuter permit for the upcoming school year, do you guys know when the website will be updated?

The first college I went to was decently ranked, around the 35-45 range. Many people there were premed just like at WashU, however most people I knew from my first college did not get into med school. Some did, but the vast majority did not. They were all very hardworking as well and many were EMTs throughout all of college and did a lot to boost their resumes. On the flip side, many people I knew at WashU did get into med school. Many even got in straight out of college! The percentage difference of admitted from both schools is quite staggering, at least based on my anecdotal experience.

I was wondering, does graduating from WashU specifically give you a big edge when applying to med school? Or does the premed department help a lot in giving you an extra boost? Are the rec letters they write very helpful or do they work to set you up with experiences you can't get at most other colleges? Or rather, is it just that WashU students tend to be smarter and therefore tend to test better on the MCAT? I do wonder if it's just the latter as getting a strong score on your first attempt surely greatly boosts your chances."

Please Help - freshman seeking advice w ampersand programs ,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1ctkxp8/please_help_freshman_seeking_advice_w_ampersand/,5,9,2024-05-16 19:09:55,"Hey! incoming freshman here, I was wondering if anyone could give me advice regarding my fyp application.

  
I'm interested in two ampersand programs - Holocaust and GCP. Having little intel on either of these programs, I'm still debating on whether I should rank them or not.

In the case of the Holocaust course, I'm personally invested in the area and have conducted multiple projects regarding the issue back in hs. The holocaust wasn't the main focus so I don't know much abt it but have always found it interesting. The curriculum sounds fun and I've heard that it isn't as competitive as programs like medsoc. Also, getting to know the people and the professors sound really nice. 

However, I'm not sure if it'll be worth the time and effort. While it is something I'm curious abt, it has nothing to do with my career path and I'm worried it'll end up being a huge burden on my workload. Especially with the reviews I've read on professor walke, I'm a bit intimidated. On top of that, I love reading but I can't memorize stuff for my life. The only B I had from hs was AP world history. 

Similar situation with GCP, though I assume it has more competition. I'm not that big on refugees or migration, tho I love geography. I'm bigger on environment and human geo. The concept of GCP sounds interesting but again, it highly recommends a foreign language and seems like a relatively big commitment (tho I've heard that it's better than the holocaust).

These programs sound rly fun and could potentially add a new perspective to my resume or sth but I'm not sure if I'll be risking my GPA :/ Idk if I should stick with beyond boundaries courses and fy seminars or go for ampersands. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I have sent my AP scores to washu, however they still assigned the math placement in my FL2024 registered courses. My AP scores don't appear in the Scores and Placement tab in webstac either. 

My questions are:

1. Does everyone have the math placement course registered on webstac despite their AP scores? Or is this registration a mistake?

2. If so, am I supposed to email the school and remind them of my AP scores now or should I wait till I get an advisor assigned?

We're only looking for guys, since the apartment will be shared with an angel in human form called Yuanpeng (ig: @ spark.lyp) (I'm actually not exaggerating, he's one of the kindest people I've met)

Here are some of the perks:  
**Low rent**: *$550/month!!*  
**Fully furnished**: Comes with a desk, bed, under-bed storage, bookshelf, closet storage, everything. The living room and kitchen are also fully furnished.  
**Bombastic kitchen**: The kitchen has a huge island and will be stocked with basically all the kitchen implements and appliances a chef could want: fridge, oven, stove, dishwasher, sink disposal, woks, pans, pots, rice cooker, insta-pot, toaster, coffee machine, you name it.  
**Ideal location**: 1 min from United Provisions, 30 seconds from the Loop, and 13 minutes to campus on foot.  
**Lots of space**: You will share a 3 bedroom, 1.5 bathroom apartment with only one other person, Yuanpeng.  
**In-unit washer/dryer**: absolute lifesaver.  
**Private balcony and entry/exit**: My bedroom has its own door onto the balcony and outdoor stairs, which is *incredibly* convenient.

I am wondering the process/the possibility of appealing a grade/final grade in a class in artsci. I just wanted advice on how to start that process and if anyone else here has done so and their experience.

Situation:

Half my class (appx 10-12 people) were caught using GPT-4 to help aid in/totally write their papers for an assignment in early March. I recieved a grade in the mid to higher eighties for a paper in early March and did not use GPT-4 or any generative AI to aid/help write my paper. Professor intially failed those people. Eventually, professor allowed those people to rewrite the paper for a new grade. I am unsure if they also did/did not refer them to academic integrity board. Regardless, papers are rewritten. Grade distribution before the paper: close to 70 and with a low in the 50s. Grade distribution after cheaters were allowed to rewrite papers: low 85 with average above my score, 88. I find this to be extremely unfair. Why do cheaters get to rewrite their paper and get a similar grade to mine? If I had the oppertunity to rewrite the paper I am sure I would of scored higher. This matters because I am on the border between two grades by a very narrow margin.

This class used a TA to grade. Professor directed TA how to grade and set the grading policy.

I have not discussed this with any admin/the professor themself. The professor would not react positively if I did contact them  to appeal. I am wondering if I should just get straight the department head."

"WashU Trustee Discusses Antisemitism, Federal Investigations in National Zoom Call",https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1cl7nr8/washu_trustee_discusses_antisemitism_federal/,21,13,2024-05-06 01:57:13,"[https://theintercept.com/2024/05/04/josh-gottheimer-mike-lawler-campus-protests/](https://theintercept.com/2024/05/04/josh-gottheimer-mike-lawler-campus-protests/)

All quotes from reporting by Prem Thakker, Akela Lacy at The Intercept. 

Lede: 

DURING A CALL hosted by the centrist political group No Labels, Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., spoke with close to 300 attendees, including trustees from several universities, about how Congress could help crack down further on student protesters — and how the FBI could get more involved. 

Summary:

* NYU Executive Vice Chair Bill Berkley said in the call, ""And, by the way, the FBI and the terrorist monitoring groups know this — why haven’t we seen any action by the federal government?""
* Andrew Bursky, WashU board chair, gave a number of quotes:
   * **On antisemitism**, Bursky said America’s tradition of campus protests was “a positive thing,” but that there’s a “clear dark line” between allowing free speech and condoning antisemitism. “And I think you guys in Congress have darkened that line today with this piece of legislation,” he added.
   * **On students' rights to protest**, ""Students had forfeited their right to protest,"" Bursky went on, due to “physical violence, or threats of physical violence or harassment,” among other things.
   * **On solutions to perceived chaos,** Bursky said that universities that have failed to make that line clear and as a result “have chaos and anarchy,” stating that “the only way to fix it is to bring in law enforcement.”
   * **On physical harm,** Bursky said, “Any injury of any individual, protestor or a member of law enforcement, is very unfortunate and regrettable.”
   * **On balance of free speech and violence,** Bursky added, “So long as those restrictions … are respected, the freedom of members of the university community to engage in protest must and will be protected,” he wrote. “Also, to be clear, protests that decay into violence or speech that is hate speech threatening to individuals or specific groups will never be acceptable.”
* Joshn Gottheimer, D-N.J., applauded university leadership for bringing police to campus. "

before i beginn....covid sucked n i do exaggerate here n there  to turn it into a llight hearted joke of the past so pls take ts  w a grain of salt...i mean no harm. I had fun writign this n i hope u have fun reading this if u do...u really dont have to theres better things u can do w ur time i promise.. but if you choose to stay enjoy!

My reflection: Im boutta graduate...not even going to my own graduation tho... no cap n gown i aint go to class...so better words finishing my undergraduate chapter at 69.999% Zoom university other 30.0000001% ""real"" classes.. idk the transition doozy yet fun... tough but interesting im sure we all learnt a lot..My refleciton TLDR cuz I dont expect you to read this shit but if you do enjoy....anyways... I learnt a lot both intellectually but most importantly about myself esp living a 1000ish mi away from home (however far an unspecified coordinate on planet earth is from WashU...im from area 51 yall frfr)

Non academic stuff: Getting a car here best thing ever....cops dont give a shit about speeding n sometimes they will even speed with you def a fun experience . aint nun better than cuttin up in traffic w 12 :) (the speed limit on lindell SHOULD NOT be 25) but it makes sense why cops dont care cuz theres too much crime in the city to worry about. Car culture in STL is amazing....lots of places to explore in the middle of the country....you don't have to party if you don't want to. but if you look hard enough and if you're likeable enough you will get invited to a few.

Its all fun n games with classes and academics n shit until u reach upper divs....where classes r extremely disorganized (esp in STEM). you r basically expected to teach yourself at that point which i Iiked cuz it gave me a lot of autonomy over the way I learnt (no hw no weekly quizzes just exams which makes getting good grades harder but the learning experience in upper divs is a lot more individualized and fun). Upper div TA's are super critical for no reason...shii I thought I was my biggest critic till I met them.... but I  appreciate a harsh critic cuz they keep it real with you

......which is kinda hard find in the student body here.... now wait - imma explain why

i aint gon lie...COVID was a disaster to the social scene here. You got these goofy ass cliques with a fuck ton of drama going on...what happens when rich sheltered kids enter the real world and don't know how to be a real person to ppl and don't know what communication is in a world of social media and telephones.. bro just go touch grass at that point...anyways back to the cliques. People gatekeep the cliques w their fucking lives on the line. If they are in the clique n ur sorry ass tries to join...im sorry to tell u lil bro ur INSTNATLY cooked cuz the expectations are that they are automatically superior to you....n i was so in awe by their aura of overhwlming ignorance that I took a step back. Aight enough of the jokes...essentially COVID which caused that shit made me keep my distance from ppl. I learnt a lotta about mf's n how devious they can be...life lessons learned that will live with me.... Covid def ruined the social scene in comaparison to other classes that came after imo.....im glad i stayed home at (area 51 remember) my first year got close to my friends from Jupiter, Mars, and even different galaxies shits wild.. ok but fr the homies from home 4L....i cant say i met a ton of great ppl here. (which is partially my fault as I indulge in solitude...)...ppl r REALLLLLLY judgemental whether it be they fw you or they dont but its subtle. if ur here ur more than likely smart so im sure you will figure it out. I will say i met a couple cool ppl here...very interesting hobbies...always a good time.

One last thing datamatch is overhyped. (it dont matter anyways cuz girls can be a str8 pain in the ass i aint gon lie) Ok but fr tho yall b NPCs on ts..yall's profiles r dull asf. I love the questions tho... learnt a lot about the washu student body without even having to converse a single word with 99% of the student body which I think is fascinating...quiet but observant I stand.

I don't expect anybody to be taking this shit seriously...but If you read this far... thank you... if you didn't well you missed out on some fun... I had helluva lotta hella fun writing this so Im sure you'd have fun reading this. whether u agree or not...i kept it real."

Does Boeing give WashU money? Is it both? What is it used for? How much is it? These are basic questions that I haven’t seen any answers to.

I know this should be an exciting moment, but I’m honestly not very excited about attending. I mainly committed because of an enormous amount of pressure from my family and I didn’t have any other offers from similarly ranked institutions. Don’t get me wrong, I really do love WashU as a school, and I can see myself fitting in here, plus I already know people there. But I just can’t wrap my head around being in St. Louis, which is why WashU wasn’t one of my top picks. I have family in the area, so I’ve been to STL multiple times, and every time I visit, I find it boring with not much going on. For reference, I’m from a major west coast city, so I kinda like big city life. STL seems so underwhelming to me with not much to do, and it’s nothing like where I’m from. Also, I don’t like how STL is a car dependent city with bad public transit (I care about this because I prefer taking public transit). 
At WashU, it seems like people don’t really leave campus, and when they do, they just go to the loop. it also seems like the loop is the only place there is to go off campus. Overall, I wish WashU was located in a city like Boston, NYC, or even Chicago, and then I would feel like the school is absolutely perfect for me. And compared to those cities, I feel like STL can’t offer much. I also know a few people who didn’t apply just because it’s in St. Louis, and I know I wouldn’t have applied if my parents hadn’t forced me.

I've done my fair share of research, but nothing beats firsthand experiences and insights from those who've been through it.

The school I'm currently at isn't quite meeting my expectations academically or socially, and I'm yearning for a change of scenery and a fresh start. However, I don't want to jump into anything blindly.

If you've ever transferred schools, I'd love to hear about your experience. What made you decide to transfer? How did you go about choosing the right school? Did the transfer process itself pose any unexpected challenges? And perhaps most importantly, do you feel like it was the right decision in the end?

Additionally,  I'd love to hear about your experiences there too. What sets your school apart in terms of supporting and integrating transfer students into the community? 

Outside of transferring itself, how well do you like WashU, if at all? What is your favorite and least favorite part of it?

Any insights, tips, or words of wisdom you can offer would be immensely appreciated. Making this decision feels like a big step, and I want to make sure I'm as informed as possible before taking it.

Thanks in advance for your help, and I'm looking forward to reading your responses!"

PSA To Waitlisted Students: Don't sweat it. It does not matter where you go to college,https://www.reddit.com/r/washu/comments/1bxmsq9/psa_to_waitlisted_students_dont_sweat_it_it_does/,33,5,2024-04-06 21:29:20,"I graduated from Wash U undergrad 10 years ago. Still, I remember the college application process well and all the stresses of those days. With admissions rates falling lower and lower by the year, I can only imagine how stressful it must be for current high school kids and I feel for you all. I feel I am in a unique position to give advice as I attended a less highly ranked school first then transferred to Wash U. Let me give my PSA:

I know how you feel right now. If I asked you would say: I only have one shot at college, and where you graduate college will affect how I am perceived forever. It will shape my entire future. Going to a highly ranked school will give me life opportunities others can only dream of. To quote Luke Skywalker from The Last Skywalker, ""amazing, every word of what you just said was wrong.""

First of all, the college ranking system has always been nonsense. When I was at Wash U it was 12th overall. Now it's 20-something. Did Wash U get worse? Did other schools get better? No and no. Perceptions change and some magazine just changed its mind on how to rank things. It's as subjective as asking someone who's better Michael Jordan or LeBron James? It's just random people's opinions and who cares end of day.

Secondly, no one cares where you went to college after you graduate and enter the real world. My field is filled with people from all sorts of backgrounds. Mostly state schools, though occasionally you will have an ivy or Wash U-level ranked school alum. But not a single one of the senior directors or VPs or people who are kicking ass every day are from those schools. Most are from a local state school. Where you go to school does not matter. Job performance is what matters and where you went to school has absolutely no bearing on it. 

What about prestige though? Won't I reap social benefits? Well no one cares about that beyond a brief compliment. Think about it, do you know someone who went to a prestigious school? You probably at first said ""oh wow that's a great school!"" and then that was it. Did you want to be his or her friend just because he went to Duke or Northwestern? No right? You will reap hardly any social benefits from going to a high-ranked college, and if you do find yourself surrounded by people who judge everyone based on where they went to college then those are pretentious assholes anyways who you shouldn't be friends with. I know Wash U is less prestigious than the schools I mentioned. Insert the common complaint of ""no one has heard of Wash U."" Trust me though, I know people who went to more prestigious schools and almost ALL of them have a chip on their shoulder for ""no one having heard of my school."" ""People get UPenn confused with Penn State."" ""People think University of Chicago is a local state school."" ""Cornell is the weakest ivy so no one respects me."" Believe me, even if you were at Harvard you would feel you are being slighted by society.

Lastly, Wash U will not offer you career opportunities you cannot get anywhere else. Nor will any top college. Yes, even Harvard will not. Classes are still classes end of the day and all colleges use the same textbooks. You still need to apply to jobs and learn skills that will make you employable. No one is going to just hand you a job because you went to X college. Yes, Wash U will likely have better facilities and labs to bolster a med school or graduate school application. However, if you are someone academically driven and disciplined enough to be waitlisted at Wash U, you will still maximize your opportunities at a state school. If you are smart and driven you will find a way. You will succeed and likely thrive. If anything, you may stand out at your state school as a go-getter and therefore get incredible rec letters. At Wash U it will be harder to stand out as everyone will be similar to you.

Keep your fingers crossed. If you get off the waitlist, great! Congratulations. Wash U is a neat place and you will enjoy it. But if you don't, don't sweat it. It's Wash U's loss, not yours. You will still kick ass no matter what. Go out and carve out your path in life. Make your state school proud by showing what their alums are capable of. If you still have a dream to attend Wash U then you can attend Wash U for grad school, and perhaps by then rather than being waitlisted Wash U will be begging you to join them."
