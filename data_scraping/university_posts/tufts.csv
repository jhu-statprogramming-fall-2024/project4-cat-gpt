I just got everything together for graduating early and now I'm left with over half a lease at an apartment that I don't plan on using (oops), so I was hoping to sublet my room out if anyone is looking for a place to sublet for January 1st through June 1st.

  
About the apartment:

* Located on University Avenue (right next to Hill Hall)
* 4 bedrooms total (only 1 being sublet).
* 2 bathrooms (1 full bathroom and one half-bathroom).
* A fully-furnished kitchen.
* Free laundry.
* Central heating and air conditioning.
* High speed (>250Mbps) internet.
* Less than a 5 minute walk to all of upper campus, the green line, and the JCC.
* \~6-7 minute walk to the library and the gym.
* The bedroom comes with a bed, a desk, a rug, and a large closet.
* One parking space in the driveway, as well as free parking on the road
* A partially-furnished basement that is being turned into a living room/study room.

The rent is $1050/month plus electricity, internet, and gas as utilities (rarely higher than $80/month) and these numbers are negotiable if push comes to shove.

In terms of frats, I've read on another post here that they are very welcoming, but what kind of people join the frats? I don't know much about frats other than whatever you see in media and stereotypes but I understand that's not the case for everyone. I'm not into drinking whatsoever but the connections, friendships, and housing seem enticing. Are there certain frats where you aren't really pressured to drink, what's frat life like (how is it different from any other student's) and what's the rushing/hazing like?

You should try this if you want a side hustle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/1gij8ek/you_should_try_this_if_you_want_a_side_hustle/,0,0,2024-11-03 09:36:56,"Just writing this to help out anyone who needs some extra money. For the past 2 months I've been using this AI tool called Insta Doodle ([Link here](https://instadoodle.com/cb-special?&shield=3d53dzr5q37zgq65qjx4p902ue)) to make a decent amount of money on the side. It's a platform that allows you to generate whiteboard explanation videos. They're the type of videos you see on a lot of sales pages that explain the concept of whatever's being sold.

I've been creating and selling the videos to new ecommerce stores, Skool communities and on marketplaces like Fiverr, Freelancer, Upwork and believe it or not Etsy lol (I've also seen a few people selling them on eBay so I might try that in future). I sell basic videos for $20-$40 depending on length and upsell the voiceover which I use ElevenLabs to generate for an extra $20. Considering Insta Doodle is only $37 for lifetime access it's pretty easy to turn a profit, all you need is one sale basically and you've broken even.

On the marketplaces mentioned I just made listings and they're slowly getting more sales as they get reviews. I think success on Fiverr, Upwork and Etsy is more of a time thing, you write a decent pitch and then just wait for results. I also respond to any requests I see on Fiverr, Upwork and Freelancer where they're looking for whiteboard animation, product explanation videos or a product spokesperson (a whiteboard video is kind of a spokesperson lol).

As for selling to ecommerce stores and Skool communities I first tried cold emailing using mailing lists that I bought but I didn't have much success. I found the most success just dming accounts on Instagram and TikTok with a sales pitch, pricing and a couple example videos (The newer the business the easier they are to sell I've found). The conversion rate on these messages is actually pretty crazy, I haven't calculated the number but this is where I've made the most money.

Delete this post if it's not allowed but I thought it'd be helpful for anyone needing some extra money, we've all got bills haha."

"Veterinary Anesthetic Xylazine (""Tranq"") Found in Increasing Percentage of Greater Boston Samples of Fentanyl, Cocaine, and Other Illicit Drugs - Treatment Resources and Harm Reduction Info",https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/1gegmbd/veterinary_anesthetic_xylazine_tranq_found_in/,0,0,2024-10-28 23:33:38,"Full article (with pictures and charts) available [here](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/xylazine-tranq-dope-fast-facts).

**Summary**

*As this February 2023* [*article*](https://www.boston.com/news/health/2023/02/22/massachusetts-xylazine-tranq-epicenter/) *notes, the veterinary sedative xylazine (""tranq"") is not only highly prevalent in Massachusetts relative to other states; it is also increasing at a more rapid pace there. The percentage of statewide fentanyl samples testing positive for xylazine, which as of early 2024 was a shockingly high* ***42%*** *- one of the highest percentages in the nation - as well as the number of fatal ODs involving xylazine, are both still increasing in Massachusetts.*

*In terms of the distribution of xylazine within the state, as this May 2024* [*article*](https://www.masslive.com/news/2024/05/why-western-mass-is-being-disproportionately-harmed-by-tranq.html) *explains, Western Massachusetts, including Springfield and Hampden County in particular, has been disproportionately hit by tranq because its rich network of interstate highways serves as a drug distribution hub for the rest of New England. In addition, data from state and national law enforcement agencies show that the Greater Boston area also has an elevated percentage of xylazine-containing fentanyl samples.*

***Note: Particularly important for Tufts students is the discovery that fentanyl, and by extension xylazine, have been increasingly found as contaminants in cocaine, ecstasy / Molly, fake ""Xanax"" bars, and even marijuana; thus, buying street drugs other than dope / heroin carries the risk of unintended exposure to xylazine and fentanyl.***

In the early 2000s, the veterinary anesthetic xylazine began to taint illegal drug supplies in Puerto Rico. From there, it spread to the East Coast of the United States, beginning in Philadelphia, where this so-called ""tranq"" dope attracted an ardent fan base.

At present, xylazine has been found in fentanyl and heroin samples from throughout the continental United States. It is most prevalent in the South and Northeast.

Drug Enforcement Agency statistics indicate that in 2022, 23% of seized fentanyl powder contained xylazine.

# Fast Fact [\#1](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/my-blog/hashtags/1) - Xylazine is a Veterinary Tranquilizer

Xylazine belongs to a group of chemicals known as phenothiazines.

Significantly, this group of structurally related compounds also includes tricyclic antidepressants and the alpha-adrenergic agonist clonidine, a blood pressure regulator that is used to mitigate the Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and anxiety caused by opioid withdrawal.

In veterinary medicine, xylazine is used as a surgical anesthetic for horses, rabbits, and other animals because it produces sedation, muscle relaxation, and analgesia (decreased pain).

Possible medical uses of xylazine for humans were investigated, but its side effects, particularly bradycardia (slow heart rate) and hypotension (low blood pressure), were judged to be too severe.

# Fast Fact [\#2](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/my-blog/hashtags/2) - Xylazine Boosts the Effects of Fentanyl

The vast majority of the xylazine available in the United States is combined with fentanyl in so-called ""tranq"" dope.

When taken on its own, xylazine is unlikely to be particularly recreational.\* However, when mixed with fentanyl, it increases the sedation, respiratory depression, and other effects of fentanyl.

\*During college, I injected veterinary xylazine; trip report available [here](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/medical-grade-xylazine-product-review-pure-garbage-with-no-place-in-the-recreational-pantheon). In addition, I wrote about xylazine hitting the dope supply in my home city in Upstate New York [here](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/post/rest-in-peace-gabapentin).

Mixing xylazine with fentanyl causes a ""nod"" that is much closer to anesthetized unconsciousness than to your average, in-and-out heroin or fentanyl high.

# Fast Fact [\#3](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/my-blog/hashtags/3) - Xylazine Increases the Chance and Severity of Overdose

Because it increases the respiratory depression and low blood pressure caused by fentanyl, xylazine greatly increases the risk of OD.

Because xylazine is not an opioid, Narcan \[naloxone\] is not effective in reversing xylazine overdose. However, Narcan should still be administered in cases of suspected OD because the majority of xylazine in the U.S. is sold in combination with illicit fentanyl powder and pills.

There is no approved antidote or reversal agent for xylazine overdose; treatment consists of supportive care involving mechanical ventilation in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

# Fast Fact [\#4](https://www.concreteconfessionalblog.com/my-blog/hashtags/4) - Xylazine Causes Skin Sores That Can Lead to Sepsis and Amputation

For reasons that are not yet understood, in some users, xylazine causes widespread skin lesions that appear 24 to 48 hours after first use.

These ulcers begin as pea- to penny-sized, semicircular lesions found on the arms, legs, face, and other areas (see pic below). They grow rapidly for as long as xylazine is ingested, and they have a tendency to become infected.

Infection of the ulcers can lead to sepsis, in which bacteria spread to the blood, causing multi-organ-system damage and death.

The rate of amputations is very high in xylazine users relative to users of fentanyl, heroin, and other illicit opioids not mixed with xylazine.

Once the user stops ingesting xylazine, the ulcers gradually disappear over a period of days to weeks (so long as infection is resolved and they are kept clean to promote healing).

However, the sores can cause significant, long-term scarring.

*Important Note: These xylazine sores are not related to route of administration. They appear whether the xylazine is snorted, injected, or smoked.*

# Harm Reduction / Risk Mitigation Strategies

If you are using fentanyl in the United States in 2024, it is very likely that at least some of the dope that you are snorting or injecting contains xylazine.

It is imperative that you obtain test strips for xylazine, which are available for free from a variety of government divisions / agencies as well as nonprofit groups.

In New York State, for example, the Office of Addiction Services and Supports (OASAS) will send you xylazine test strips for free (order form [here](https://forms.ny.gov/s3/Harm-Reduction-Order-Form); Narcan \[naloxone\] and other harm reduction supplies are available as well).

If you have recently ingested what you believe to be tranq dope and have even a single sore anywhere on your body, you need to go to a doctor and obtain a broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately. It is quite possible that life and limb depend upon it.

# Carpe Diem Before There Isn't Any Diem Left To Carpe

The wave of fatal xylazine-fentanyl overdoses that the U.S. is currently experiencing is reminiscent of the period in 2015-2016 when fentanyl began replacing heroin in the U.S. illicit opioid supply, as a result of which addicts were dropping like flies.

There has never been a better time to get clean and sober - while you still have all four limbs and haven't sustained severe brain damage from an OD!

I am applying ED1 to Tufts. I was wondering if I could sit for the November 2nd SAT. The deadline for ED1 is Nov 4th, but on their website, it said that I could take the November SAT. The thing is that the results come out two weeks after the test, which is Nov 15th.

I am currently taking AP bio and have an A+ and took AP chem last year and ended with a B+ in the class and a 5 on the exam. Additionally, I fear that the only extracurriculars related to stem that I have is writing for my school’s science journal and a lab internship in immunology that I did over the summer. The rest of my extracurriculars are mostly related to foreign languages, theater, choir, music, art, etc. however I do have quite a bit of leadership in these areas.

I’m considering applying to the **Tufts CS Post-Baccalaureate Certificate (Masters Track)** program and was hoping for some advice on my chances.

Here’s a bit about my background:

* I have **no prior background in CS**, as my academic and professional experience is in **healthcare**.
* My **undergraduate GPA** is **below 3.0**
* Now, I’m currently in **graduate school for healthcare**, and I have a **3.85 GPA** (only took 8 hour credits so far)
* I’ve also been taking coding classes on online platforms and have completed some  projects on my own.

Given this mix of factors, does anyone have insights on how Tufts evaluates applicants for their Post-Bacc Certificate program, particularly with a lower undergrad GPA but strong performance in grad school? Any tips for strengthening my application would be greatly appreciated!

I am interested in transferring due to reasons like:

- The university is a suitcase school (everyone goes home on the weekends, I’m out of state).

- Lack of social connection/collaboration. The clubs here are not really active and I found that when I got here, a lot of students here are nice, but they’re sticking with people that they’ve known since high school. I’m not social by any means and I rather stay to myself and study, but it’s hard to connect with people when I would like that connection. I do plan to start my own club though.

- The research opportunities here are limited. I’m interested in psychology (my major), but there’s only two active labs. I would have to go outside the university to find other research.

- I feel too far from the city and the transportation in the area isn’t that great.

- My major is psychology, but I have more interest in clinical and neuropsychology.

Questions I have for Tufts students:

- What is the workload like? How does it affect you mentally and physically? How much time do you have to yourself when able?

- What is the research opportunities like? What type of research have you done and what has been the process in getting research?

- What is social life like? Are other students willing to help other students?

- How is transportation getting to Boston?

- How challenged do you feel at Tufts compared to taking a bunch of AP’s in high school?

- How has integrating to Tufts been like as a transfer student?

- What has it been like being a student with accommodations? I have ADHD.

- What is the rigor difference like after transferring from another university/college that doesn’t really have an emphasis on rigor (though is still rigorous like all colleges are) like Tufts does and is known for?

- What is it like being a pre-med? How is calc and orgo classes?

- What are other important things I should know? Besides the hill, I have the same experience at this current university I’m attending, haha.

I’m not set on transferring to Tufts 100% (if I even get in). I just started freshman year, and I would like to see how things go, but I’d like to get an early view to see how really green the grass is on the other side. Maybe it’s not. "

We are the Student Research Institute, an independent, completely student-run think tank based in Boston, and we are looking to create a recruitment team! Our group started a little over a year ago when we realized how important it is for the voices of our generation to be heard in matters of politics, policy, and much more. Our goal as an organization is to uplift our voices in the most professional way possible. Currently, we are seeking 501c3 status as a nonprofit and have several articles already posted to our website, [*studentresearchinstitute.org.*](https://www.studentresearchinstitute.org/)

Right now, most of our staff is made up of Boston University students, but we are looking to expand to other universities across the US. To do this, we need people from other universities to join our organization as recruitment managers, where your sole job is to recruit analysts to SRI from your university. This can be done via word of mouth, student organizations, and many other ways. If interested in this position, please fill out this short [*Google form*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBL5SjsFUXl-54_ZLZhZMTuV74B8dEsEI27W8l7xjZuKaumg/viewform) and we will reach out to schedule an interview with you in September. Another way in which you can join our organization is as a research analyst. This involves conducting research in one of our many research initiatives and writing maximum 2 articles a semester for our organization. If interested in this position, please fill out this analyst application. We are so excited to meet you and if you have any questions, please email us *thestudentresearchinstitute@gmail.com.*"

Men's March Against Abortion Returning To Boston,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/1f7zetf/mens_march_against_abortion_returning_to_boston/,28,1,2024-09-03 13:04:34,"Well, it's Fall(ish), and that means a bunch of out-of state traditional Catholics will again shut down Commonwealth Ave for an all-men funeral march mourning the government's unwillingness to dictate our family planning.

This year's event seems to be scheduled for November 16, so if you're planning to have a car anywhere near the Back Bay or Downtown that morning or afternoon you may want to change that to be anywhere else instead.

If you'd like to take a more active role in telling these jokers to stuff it, you can join in with Reddit's own Boston Clown March! We march ahead of them the whole way playing jolly circus music so that they have a thematically appropriate backing track, and so their tradcath audiovisual guy has to again contend with all their footage having faint clown music. We have clown makeup, fake noses, and a truly unreasonable amount of kazoos, so while our brass section tends to steal the show we welcome any and all comers regardless of clownery experience.

Last year was a real hoot, especially when we made it to the Parkman Bandstand where all their wives were supposed to be waiting and found they had collectively only managed to get like five women.

Rave reviews:

even though i am definitely up for the challenge, i know there is also a chance i won’t get into the class. should i “retake” calc 2 or should i skip a math class this sem and take something like CS instead?

How LGBTQ+ friendly--especially toward nonbinary and trans students--are the students and faculty? I got the vibe that the school is very supportive but just wanted some insider information.

How's social life and work/life balance? I'm not looking for crazy frat parties, just how is it making friends and hanging out with them? Is the student body competitive or collaborative? Is the workload too high to maintain a healthy social life? Is there a sense of community throughout the student body?

In the SoE Pre-Matriculation Credits Workshop, they mentioned that to fill two semesters of the residency requirement, you had to have 9 courses totaling 32 credits. Does this mean I would have to take summer courses to fill these credits, or is there any other way to fill the requirement?

They also mentioned that many SoE degrees require 8 semesters of study independent of total credits and semesters of residency, such as if an 8-course sequence had to be fulfilled, but they didn't say which degrees require this. Is it possible to get a CS degree in 6 semesters?

Lastly, it seems like they make it pretty hard to graduate early. Is it too ambitious to graduate early and also complete a double major in a related field like math?"

for incoming freshman scared by all the don't-come-to-tufts posts ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/1e9p0g4/for_incoming_freshman_scared_by_all_the/,62,12,2024-07-22 20:48:31,"I'm a rising senior who LOVES tufts now, but I also had a hard time adjusting, especially during my underclassman years. Sophomore year was definitely the worst- like a lot of people I know, my friend group really fell apart and it was honestly due to a huge lack of maturity and self-esteem on my part. I was essentially friendless by the middle of the semester and desperately wanted to drop out, but ended up sticking with it and now here I am. 

When I was applying to schools in high school, I ended up applying and getting into Tufts ED1 (I'm from Mass and knew a lot of kids who went there and liked it). Initially I was really excited to be going to such a selective school and felt pretty honored that they chose me, especially since I didn't really think I had what it took to get in. But that quickly turned to nausea-inducing fear when I went online (specifically reddit) and read about others experiences here. There was so much hate for the school, and I was really worried that I wasn't going to have the true college experience that I wanted- meaning going out to frats, do some crazy shit every once in a while, and finally become independent. But what I was reading/hearing was making me think there was NO way I would have that at Tufts and I would be super lonely all the time, be overloaded with work, and spend my weekends going to bed at 9 every night. 

For all the incoming freshman who are reading the same thing, I wanted to share my experience to show that Tufts can be really great, while also recognizing that it's definitely a really unique place that may not be for everyone, even my classmates who are still here and graduating next spring. 

Frats/going out: 

One of the things I really like about Tufts is that greek life can be a pretty big part of your experience, but if you don't want it to be you can essentially ignore it. I don't really go anymore cause it's mostly a Freshman/Sophomore thing, but theres usually stuff every weekend and while it's not as insane as like big 10 parties are I've had my fair share of really good nights. I think what a lot of people complain about though is more that those parties can be harder to get into if you aren't on a list/don't know members/aren't in a frat or sorority yourself. I got lucky and just happen to know people in the different frats on campus, but i'm not in any greek life myself nor do I want to be. So my advice would be that if you DO want to be involved in greek life, start rushing as early as you can sophomore year (you can't do earlier than that) and befriend upperclassmen in the meantime. There are a good amount of open parties, especially at the beginning of the year, so you can just kind of walk in to them then. A lot of the resentment I hear is from non-athletes and guys cause honestly it's alotttt harder to get in, and like honestly that's super valid but again rushing and being a direct part of greek life is a good way to get around that (NOT saying it's easy again I totally get those complaints). Other than that, I loved going to the bars (the pub and the burren) as an underclassman and went out to the clubs in Boston as well, or went to dorm parties. I'm not saying it's like being in new york or anything like that at all but it's all to say that there's still stuff to do, you just have to look for it sometimes. 

School spirit: 

Okay so this one is valid, but also we all know that tufts isn't a huge sports school at all. Maybe it's cause I didn't go to a big high school with a ton of spirit, or because I didn't really care about it when applying to schools, but I honestly don't really notice it that much nor do I care all that much. But if you do really want to be around more school spirit there are always games you can go to, and football season is a LOT of fun ...but honestly because the non-athlete population is so much bigger than the athlete population not many people are hardcore Jumbo's fans, so I can definitely see where this is coming from. 

Weather: 

Y'all gotta understand it's the northeast and we aren't gunna have 80 degree weather year round. The winters suck, but the warm weather lasts until mid October and come exam season in the spring it's super nice out again. Again, because I'm from here I'm used to it so i understand it can be a bit brutal but as long as you expect it you'll be fine. 

Prestige: 

This is where the senior part comes in heavy- I've spent my summer doing informational interviews with companies from all over the place and everybody knows tufts and how great of a school it is. I'm in the social sciences so maybe it's because of that, but arguably A&S has much less of a reputation than the school of engineering, and even then you're going to be completely fine. Tufts is a top school just like Williams, Swarthmore, Amherst, etc. Ya it's small but that doesn't mean it's unknown whatsoever, and any recruiter or hiring manager will know Tufts. 

Politics: 

Tufts is a medium sized liberal arts school in one of the most democratic and liberal states in the country...along with that comes a majority progressive student population. I'm friends with republicans and moderates who don't share my own views, but I'll agree that voicing those opinions in smaller class/social settings is difficult, but the large majority of the time other people will be willing to hear what you have to say with the caveat that ya, there's inevitably going to be a lot of disagreement. 

The last thing I'll say regards academics: Yes, the workload can be pretty heavy ngl, but that's also coming from someone who does a lot of extracurriculars, works 2 jobs, and is double majoring. Even then, I still have time to chill with my roommates, go out on the weekends, and sleep in. There are definitely people who will say this isn't the case, and they're probably taking super hard classes/has an objectively harder major than me, which I can completely understand. If you're worried about this, take a deep breath and know that everyone is in the same boat. There's no shame in taking easier classes or just majoring in one thing- around 60% of kids here double-major so it adds a lot of pressure to do so, but keep in mind this isn't the norm everywhere and you gotta do what you gotta do. Tufts kids accurately have the reputation of being workaholics and try-hards, so it's a process (which I'm still trying to learn) of not comparing yourself to others and only doing what interests you/what you have the capacity to do.

I'm thinking about applying to Tufts in the fall for a BS Computer Science. I love the area and love the school, but have some questions specifically about the computer science program.

  
1. How hard is it to get into? For some reason I can't find too much information online about the difficulty of admittance for Tufts cs undergrad. Tufts being known for more medical fields makes me wonder if the bar is lower for CS applications? 

2. How are companies viewing Tufts CS graduates now? All the posts I can find from a few years ago state that the Tufts CS department was growing, where is it now?

3. And this one is honestly pretty unrelated to compsci. How does undergrad feel at Tufts? Am I going to get the typical college experience with it having a heavier focus on gradschool?

For context, I come from a competitive high school, and I think I'm one of the few people in the school who enjoys finals and APs. I get a sort of ""high"" and excitement from very intense periods of stress, but I don't enjoy prolonged stress. I probably don't care much about GPA for university since it matters less in job applications. I enjoy a somewhat competitive atmosphere and highly value my social life.

I am intending to major in Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering. I am curious about the overall campus atmosphere, culture, etc., as well as any pieces of advice or concerns you may have for me.

To be specific:

1. What made you choose this university?
2. What would two pieces of advice you'd give to an incoming freshmen?
3. Is the CE or EE department good? Are job/intern opportunities available?
4. How competitive is the atmosphere, and is it collaborative? (I want a balance of both.)
5. Are engineering students overly stressed out? If so, how do people avoid burnout/stress?
6. Is the social scene cliquey or more open? (I hate cliques.)

Is majoring in Data Science with additional International Relations major feasible if I have 37 pre-matriculation credits and am fluent in Russian (so no IR 8 semesters of a language requirement)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/1depqwe/is_majoring_in_data_science_with_additional/,0,7,2024-06-13 03:45:56,"Hello, I am in the School of Engineering and I know about the extensive graduation requirements. My primary major would be DS (applied as DS) and additional major would be IR with a minor in economics. However, I know that both of these major areas are very time intensive however I feel like I have a good predisposition since I already have around 37 general credits when 120 credits is required for BSDS. 

I am very passionate about both fields and committed to Tufts specifically for the great emphasis on interdisciplinary learning and excellence in IR. Ideally I would love to work in the tech or consulting field after graduation to gain experience, followed by creating better laws or policies around the use of technology, especially in the former Soviet Union where I am from. 

That said, I really don't want to be couped up studying during my college years. I really want to study abroad be it in Paris in one of their engineering colleges or London, have fun with friends on late nights, go on matcha runs, etc. I also want to be involved in many social activities such as Tisch College, volunteering and just enjoy my time mindfully. 

I will probably give my degree combination a try initially (I will meet up with my academic advisor around August 1st) but I would also consider minoring in IR as an alternative.

What would you guys suggest? Is it a bad idea to come and transfer out to better propel my career? Obviously I would have to work very hard, but I feel like I would have a better chance at the ivies or leading business schools if i transferred from tufts.

I also found that some classes weren't challenging enough. Additionally, as an international student, I had to take a 2-hour commute to LAX to take a flight back home. I'm originally from British Columbia so Claremont was sometimes unbearably hot for me and I hated it. From what I know, Tufts probably won't solve my issues with the lack of nightlife or the commute to go to an airport, but is there anything that people can provide that can make me like Tufts more or convince me it's better than my current school? I really want to transfer out of my current school, I was miserable there and I felt really stuck.

I am an incoming sophomore at Haverford College. Last week I was accepted into Tufts Arts & Sciences and Boston University. I grew up in Cambridge MA so I am very familiar with the area--perhaps too much. 

I am hoping for insights into the strength of Tuft's Humanities programs, specifically anthro and psych. I am wondering whether Tufts has a strong music/band culture, since Haverford is 40% athletes and lacking in a concert scene. Is Tuft's campus life lively if you're not in greek life? I am also curious whether the university feels too small. That was a problem at my previous college. & last but not least, I have some amazing friends at Haverford. Is transferring worth the risk of not finding my people?

I do eventually want to settle on the East Coast, so I feel like building connections there through Tufts could also be super helpful.

Seeking advice applying for a PhD mathematics at tufts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/1co2yp8/seeking_advice_applying_for_a_phd_mathematics_at/,0,0,2024-05-09 17:35:42,Hello I completed my undergraduate and first masters degree in aerospace engineering and went into defense industry and then currently I am pursuing a masters degree in mathematics (pure mathematics focused). As an undergraduate student I didn’t do so well because I struggled with homelessness because I was a lone immigrant with no money and I didn’t wanna drop out to work full time so survival was pretty tough. I would like to focus on differential geometry for my PhD studies but I don’t know what my chances are of getting into tufts and I also wonder if this will heavily depend on research in my current masters program that am pursuing. Am originally from East Africa but a USC so I won’t need visa. Thank you for your time 🙏

Sign The Petition to Support Tufts Full-Time Lecturers!,https://i.redd.it/103vejcp3uxc1.jpeg,10,0,2024-05-01 15:34:29,"PETITION LINK: [https://act.seiu.org/a/tufts-ftl-contract](https://act.seiu.org/a/tufts-ftl-contract) 

Tufts Full-Time Lecturers deserve a fair contract now!

We, the signers of this petition, support the Tufts University Full-time Lecturers Union with SEIU Local 509, in its negotiations for a new contract. We call on the Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences administration to negotiate a fair contract that meets the following bargaining demands: 

Strong wage increases: 
The rising cost of rent, child care, and health care are unsustainable for full-time lecturers. The entry-level salary for full-time lecturers of $64,000 is barely over the living wage for a single adult with no children in the Boston metropolitan region. Tufts University needs to pay full-time lecturers enough to live here so they can access the basic necessities to care for themselves and their loved ones.

Manageable workloads: 
Full-time lecturers are overworked and their workloads continue to grow. Lecturers teach classes, grade exams, advise and mentor students, and perform other essential service tasks that keep Tufts running. They need manageable workloads to make their work more sustainable and so more of their time is spent with students. 

Update work titles to teaching professor: 
The lecturer title is outdated and should be updated to “Teaching Professor,” which is more widely recognized and respected. Additionally, students have long used “professor” to address their instructors and the change will be consistent with Tufts School of Engineering and other peer institutions. 

Join us in calling on the Tufts University School of Arts and Sciences administration to meet the bargaining demands of full-time lecturers in their fight for a strong contract! Stand in solidarity with full-time lecturers and add your name to our petition below.

FWD: Restoring the Academic Quad for Commencement
 
Dear members of the Tufts community,

Tufts has a time-honored tradition of civil protest. Consistent with that tradition, and throughout this academic year, we have balanced our students’ right to protest with enforcing our conduct policies. Students have been sanctioned when protests affected public safety, were a clear violation of our conduct policies, or interfered with normal university operations.

Over the past two weeks, we have respected our community members’ right to advocate for their beliefs through a small camp site on the academic quad on our Medford/Somerville campus. Our staff have tried to maintain open lines of communication with the goals of ensuring safety, enforcing our policies, and avoiding the escalation we have seen at other universities across the nation. We have even delayed some preparations for Commencement as much as possible to allow the protest to resolve peacefully. But now the encampment must end, ideally peacefully and voluntarily, so we can prepare the campus for Commencement. Student Life staff will be reaching out to the protesters tomorrow morning to plan for the end of the encampment in the next few days.

The class of 2024 deserves to be celebrated. Many of this year’s graduates experienced the restrictions and losses of the pandemic and missed out on important life events including the opportunity to participate in their high school graduations. Commencement is the moment to celebrate their accomplishments with their family and friends and for us to honor their achievements as a community.

Unfortunately, at this moment when we should be coming together as a community, we have seen behavior that clearly is trying to escalate the situation. Protesters, including some who are unaffiliated with Tufts, have created conditions that have caused multiple community members and guests to lodge formal complaints. While much of Friday’s demonstration was peaceful, there were many actions that violated university policies. Demonstrators entered a classroom, blocked paths, and defaced, stickered, and scrawled obscene language on buildings throughout the campus. Even beloved spaces such as Alex’s Place on the Tisch Library roof and the Jumbo statue were marred.

Additional actions from the protestors throughout Friday and Saturday made multiple visitors at Friday’s Jumbo Days and Saturday’s admissions tours feel afraid and unwelcome, resulting in numerous complaints. These included harassment, intimidation, disruption of Jumbo Days sessions, and aggressive tactics. We will investigate every single complaint and hold those responsible fully accountable.

Since the protests on campus began in October, Student Life staff have tried to keep open lines of communication with the protesters. These conversations have focused on requests intended to keep the campus operating and to keep the entire community safe and have been largely productive. But recent exchanges have been markedly different as the protesters have sought to escalate and disrupt normal university activity. Exchanges with Student Life staff are often now followed by false claims of threats and intimidation on the protesters’ social media accounts. Let us be perfectly clear: these claims are simply inaccurate and can only be seen as an attempt to further inflame the community by deliberately misrepresenting the situation.

Following Friday’s demonstration, student organizers requested a meeting with university leadership. While we have always felt that dialogue is the best approach to resolving differences, it would not be appropriate to discuss a meeting with the student organizers until they clear the academic quad. Their request, which includes a threat to continue disruption, only comes after they have escalated their actions, caused intentional and malicious harm to our community and campus, broken multiple university policies and, most importantly, violated the values and norms of the institution. The protesters’ actions increasingly come at the expense of their fellow students' rights and a meeting cannot be a reward for such behavior.

We have met with multiple students, student groups, faculty members, and others throughout the academic year to discuss ways in which the university may be able to help people in Gaza and those affected by the war in our community in the ways an educational institution can, including by supporting Scholars at Risk, helping rebuild the educational infrastructure in Gaza when the time comes, fostering dialogue and training programs on our campus, creating gathering spaces for affected Tufts community members, and funding social gatherings and meals. As we have said before, we are deeply troubled by the tremendous loss of Palestinian life, and we desire to work with all members of our community to support both the Palestinian and the Israeli people.

It is time to celebrate the class of 2024. We are committed to maintaining an environment that will allow our students to finish the academic year strong and for the entire community to celebrate the class of 2024 at Commencement without disruptions. Our students and their families and friends deserve nothing less. We invite the entire community to join us in this endeavor peacefully and responsibly.

Sincerely,

Sunil Kumar

My question, in light of recent arrests at Columbia, Yale, and NYU, is about how the administration has approached this and other student protests? What is current (& general) climate of speech critical of the school? What happens if there is actual hate-speech? (I recognize not all protests equal hate, or anti-someone, speech.

I got offer letter from Tufts for Master's in Engineering Management, applied in R2 so received no scholarships. I have 2&half years of experience as Software engineer and Mtech degree from India. I have few questions:
1. How is Tufts University for Engineering Management?
2. Any external scholarships available for international students? 
3. This is the first batch for on campus fall 2024. Opting for it is a good idea or shall I wait and apply for better universities next year? (If you suggest to proceed with the admission please highlight some reasons that could help. If you suggest to apply next year then kindly suggest universities)
4. Going for Engineering Management as swcond master's degree is a good choice with 2 & half years of experience? Any other better options?

Your insights would be really help. Thank you!"

I’ve been lucky enough to visit both and I will be majoring in International Relations ( I know Tufts is ranked higher) but I’m quite inclined towards BU. 

BUs IR program is very respectable and I’m well aware I’ll have much more opportunity in the actual city than in Medford. BU has a super cool city vibe that I loved when I visited but idk if the LAC vibe is for me at Tufts. Plus, I get bigger and AC dorms at BU bc I got into honors.

BU also has the promise that they’ll maintain the amount of grant aid for my 4 years (80k a year) whereas even though Tufts gave me similar money (78k a year), they don’t have that promise. It is likely my family will be making more money in the coming years and I don’t want my finaid to decrease because of that. 

All of this said, is there still a reason I should choose Tufts? Is BUs network/prestige that much different? And if so, does it matter when it comes to IR or when I apply to grad school?

TL;DR: I love BU and I got into honors but am still afraid I’d be placed at a disadvantage compared to Tufts students (IR-wise), so is there any reason I should instead go to Tufts?"

I toured Tufts yesterday (shoutout to Grace, she was an awesome tour guide) and absolutely adored it, the vibe was so much chiller than I expected and I love the idea of a high-performing university that isn’t stressfully cutthroat. Only thing is— after my Brandeis tour in which it was mentioned most freshman dorms there don’t have AC because it’s New England and they’re sorta old (I’m from the south where no AC is basically a death sentence, so it’s a LOT less common here for dorms to not have AC), and I’m wondering if that’s a thing at Tufts as well. I have a myriad of chronic illnesses including dysautonomia, which makes it hard for my body to regulate temperature— I overheat easily and if I spend too long being too hot, I’ll get very faint or even pass out. If I’d have to get an accommodation for AC (I.e. only like, ten rooms total have it so I’d have to go through disability services), how’s that process for anyone who’s navigated it before? Is it super hard to get accommodations or are they pretty helpful and understanding? I’d have no problem providing necessary medical documentation. 

I also just would like to survey the general tufts population and ask how the environment for trans people is— I’m queer and nonbinary, I got the vibe on campus that it’s very queer and queer accepting as a whole, but I also know national perception of trans people has only been getting worse and would like to ask how it’s been for any trans and/or nonbinary people specifically (making friends/social climate more than violence type stuff, because I definitely didn’t get the energy that hate crimes would be a worry as much as it would be in some places back home. 

Lastly— any tips for getting in? My GPA is a 4.52 weighted and 4.0 unweighted, ACT 35 (plan on submitting), SAT 1440 (plan on not submitting), and honors, AP, and dual enrollment classes. My extracurriculars include rock climbing team, national honor society, science national honor society, church youth group (I’m not religious but my family is and it’s a good way to get in some community service), I’m in a string quartet in addition to being principal cellist of my school’s top orchestra, and I also have a part-time job working retail. I’m definitely the most worried that my extracurriculars aren’t up to par (no county/regional orchestra, not many leadership positions, not very involved with clubs at school other than NHS and SNHS) along with having less schedule rigor than some of my peers (junior year, I’m taking AP lang, AP calc ab and bc, and some dual enrollment language classes, but most of the people around me are taking 4-5 APs) but being chronically ill is also a full time commitment (i.e. to help with fatigue and stress caused by chronic pain, I go to acupuncture weekly so that’s another commitment but not the kind colleges want to hear about).

Considering attending in the fall and was looking up courses on the SIS and the BSME Degree Sheets. How does the college handle those students that come in with significant pre-matriculation credits from AP scores (say Physics, Chem., Calc BC and Eng-Lang) up to the maximum allowed? On the degree sheet that would leave just EN 1 and ES 2 for the first year. Outside of taking the next required math classes, does the department push you towards loading up on HASS electives or are you able to register for some of the typically sophomore level ME classes (ME 10, 20, 21 40, etc. for example)? I may be interested in a semester abroad or in having the freedom to graduate a semester early. Creating some flexibility in my schedule by junior year would be a goal in using AP credits strategically. I'm worried that by way of limiting access to sophomore level ME courses (either directly by requiring sophomore class standing to register or indirectly by those classes being full by registration time) that the benefits of having a good amount AP credits might not be that useful in the end.

To my great joy, in December, I discovered that I had been accepted into the 2028 graduating class---not only accepted but awarded the Presidential Merit Scholarship of $96,000 spread across all four years ($24,000 every year). (Yes, I did sob with joy). For a long time afterward, I was convinced this was where I would attend, but was still holding out hope for the more prestigious art schools (RISD and Cooper Union). 

Now, in late March, the rest of the decisions have been released: along with many acceptances into California state schools, a couple of admissions into UCs (though I don't really want to stay in California; (going East Coast has always been my dream), a waitlist invitation from RISD, I just found out that I got into Tufts University, more specifically SMFA. Tufts, my mom's alma mater, is an incredible school that I 100% did not think I was going to get into, but I'm very happy that I did. In fact, I'm much more compelled to attend Tufts than I thought I would be---though I'm not entirely sure why.

This brings me to my main point: Pratt or SMFA?? I want to study Fine Arts (my Pratt major is Fine Arts with an Emphasis in Painting), but I'm not entirely sure what I want to do after graduation. I was kind of hoping art school would help me figure that out... 

Of course, there are pros and cons to each school. I love that Pratt is in New York (which has always been my goal), though I think Boston could be cool, too. My parents tell me that I shouldn't worry about money, but the scholarship from Pratt would definitely be helpful (I have an older sister going into her sophomore year at a private college, also with at $96,000 scholarship, and a brother in 6th grade who is brilliant and will certainly go to a great college). I'm not sure if Tufts has offered me money; it wasn't in the portal, but I know some schools only reveal scholarships through mail. I find the prestige of Tufts so appealing, though I know that shouldn't color my opinion of the schools---but in the art world, wouldn't a mini-Ivy degree mean a lot? Or would Pratt mean more?

This is where I need your help. If you attended either school, what did you think of them? Did they have good connections? I think that Pratt might have more connections in the art world, while Tufts has lots of academic connections. Which diploma would weigh more in the practical world? I do love academia, and if I were to go to SMFA, I want to transfer to the dual degree after my second semester (probably to get a Bachelor' in either English or History or something along those lines). How useful would that degree be? How are the professors at each school? When touring Pratt, I remember them saying most of their professors are adjuncts, which my mom heavily dislikes. But in the end, any input would be incredibly helpful!

Thank you so much for all your help! I'm so excited for college, and I'm sure I'll be happy wherever I go."

Do you know anyone with 3 gap years?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/1bmfr1u/do_you_know_anyone_with_3_gap_years/,8,0,2024-03-24 08:17:00," I am an international applicant, seeking a full-ride (ah, yes, the entitled brat as everyone likes to call us). I know I don't deserve or can't really expect to get a full-ride to any American university, but when my country isn't allowing me to study my desired subject, I can't really help but wonder.

I graduated from high school back in 2022. So, this time, I applied with 2-gap-years, and if I apply in fall 25, it would be 3-gap years. Would it be worth it?

If anyone's wondering about my STATS, it is perfect 4.0 UW GPA (no AP/IB as my school doesn't have those), 1480 SAT, and I have 2 international, 3 national honors (and a bunch of regional/school honors that I added in Additional info); my ECs were mostly in Journalism and Film; as I write (paid) at my country's national daily, have established one small online news portal, have a paid job at an online news portal, have another voluntary (which will turn paid in near future) work in another educational media platform, did some summer programs in Journalism; then, I have some photography projects, a short documentary, some film scripts and some short stories and a published book; then, I have some other voluntary works (charity, teaching, helping US aspirants with information, mentoring (essay reviewing, college suggesting, and stuff) other US aspirants - who made it with full-tuition in Fall 24).

If I apply for Fall 25, I really think I will have more honors and more impact on the ECs I've been working with; do you think I should consider Fall 25? (won't retake the SAT for 1500+ though, can't spend another $100, I know it's not a lot to you, but to me, it is).

I didn't apply for Fall 22 though, because I actually grew interested in film/journalism in my senior year of high school (I was into STEM before my senior year), and I wanted to see this through. I wrote this for my gap year explanation as well. The Fall 23 essay was crap, the Fall 24 Early essay received mixed responses, and the regular essay received unanimous appreciation, so I was thinking I would use that essay again. Also, I got waitlisted at Tufts this RD (so, it's like being in their top 17% of the applicant pool, according to previous years' CDS); do you think if I try again I could make it with a full-ride to any university?

I may as well consider doing ED2 to Tufts if I apply in Fall 25."

I'm considering a few other schools for my masters (NYU, BU, UWisc, Mich). I'm leaning towards Tufts despite the other schools' solid math depts in part because its in Boston and Boston seems to have a lot of math stuff going on.

iPad or other Tablet?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/19928qv/ipad_or_other_tablet/,3,3,2024-01-17 17:29:15,"Hi guys, its me again, this post is going to be a bit blurry. 

So I am going to Tufts this year (August) for an academic exchange year from germany. 

I am also planning on buying a Tablet (so far I've been ok with my laptop but I want something more mobile anyways). 

My thought is this: from what I hear most people in the US are in the Apple Ecosystem and use iMessage as their primary text messenger. Here in germany its WhatsApp, and iphone is very present but not as dominating as it seems in the US, therefore I also don't have any apple products since a long time now.

With the purchase of a Tablet I thought of getting an iPad simply because its a reliable easy device and i think I could connect better with people  that way and interact better with the classroom (airdrop, appletv/airplay however that's canled). Otherwise from a technological and financial standpoint I would prefer an android tablet. 

The question might be stupid or too general but: do I need an apple device in order to connect better to people in the US/at Tufts? 

Do you use an iPad or another tablet (or a laptop or pen and paper?) 

I'm just generally interested in the technological geographie at Tufts. 

EDIT: of course I am also considering other factors like that I will defenitely use the tabled beyond the exchange year.

Info for Deferred Students (Including me),https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/18l0lib/info_for_deferred_students_including_me/,12,19,2023-12-18 04:52:41,"Tufts ED results just came back for all students, and if you got deferred, like I did, you probably have a lot of questions. Although upon googling there really aren't a lot results or stats about what to do if you get deferred. So I'm going to organize what I've found out in this one post for everyone to see. Take this with a grain of salt as some of this info is very old, and some of it comes from word of mouth. Feel free to comment any info you may have as well, you not alone in your deferral. 

&#x200B;

Tufts deferrals are historically very rare, less than 10% of applications get deferred, and it is by no means a rejection. If Tufts deferred you if means that they genuinely liked your application, but something about it made them feel off. That might have been bad early senior grades or whatever the case is, but there is still something you can do. Community service, or working hard to finish the year with excellent senior grades (for those still in high school) is a way to set yourself apart. Keep working hard, and there is a good chance they'll take you regular. Deferral students also have preference over regular decision applications and will always take priority over them. How much priority, i'm not sure, but it's definitely a factor. 

&#x200B;

People do get in off deferrals at Tufts. At other schools a deferral is a light rejection, at Tufts they genuinely did want to accept you, but couldn't for some reason. Not only have I seen multiple instances of people getting deferred and then accepted online, but I even had friend which got deferred then accepted.

So my high school weighted GPA was a 4.27, and I got a 1530 on the SAT. 

I’m really nervous if I’ll get in since the squirrel uprising last week. I saw 200 fluffy brown squirrels carrying president Kumar out of his house and they dumped him in Metcalf Hall (I know, pretty inhumane). 

Students all over campus are now living in fear. We only travel in groups to avoid being abducted by the fluffy squirrels. It’s still scary out there. Every time we see them the squirrels smirk at us. 

In other news, the jumbomber is MIA since last year. We all await his return so he can kill the squirrels and restore freedom to the tufts campus (and also all our finals were virtual so that was awesome)

Anyway. I’m really nervous about admission decisions. Hoping I get in!"

German Exchange Student coming in 2024/25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/18f3xs0/german_exchange_student_coming_in_202425/,9,8,2023-12-10 13:45:28,"Hi, I am a German university student from Tübingen and will participate in an exchange year at Tufts University. Throughout the next weeks/months, I will probably ask more questions in this subreddit but I want to start with some basics: 

I already got a document with some bullet points to consider/prepare for Tufts

1. Books: the document says that it is roughly $1000 per semester to purchase needed books in general... **Is there some kind of student marketplace where you could buy cheaper used books?** 
2. Meal Plans: I already looked into the Tufts Meal plan options and am wondering what to get/what I have to get and what it is actually worth: I think (but am not entirely sure yet) I have to take the Tufts Premium Plan for at least my first semester there which costs about $4000. Usually, I am a very passionate cook and read that dorms don't have kitchens (?) I think I will still have access to one (next point), so if I can, I'd like to get off the Premium plan as soon as possible. Is that possible? **What are your experiences with the Tufts Meal Plans or with cooking on your own at Tufts?**
3. Dorms/German House: I have heard that Tufts has a specific German House for exchange students from Germany (mixed with students studying German at Tufts?). And according to pictures online, it has its own kitchen. But my general question is, what's up with that German house? is that actually just for German exchange students? 
4. I have a point in my list called Health and Wellness fees by Tufts which are $1100, does anyone know what that is actually for/what that means? 
5. More personal question: How are the gym facilities at Tufts? 
6. Within my studies, I am allowed to take 1 course per semester and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. From what i understood it is a private school that is somehow part of Tufts. But I don't fully understand why it is always highlighted as a separate instance of the University. 
7. How are public Transportation systems in the area (and to Boston)? 

The topics are all over the place I know, but if anyone can help me in just one of these aspects I'd already be very thankful! 

Greetings from Tübingen, Germany!

HELP - Freshman considering a Transfer I'm MISERABLE and desperately need help.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/17orces/help_freshman_considering_a_transfer_im_miserable/,19,23,2023-11-06 01:25:16,"I thought Tufts was my dream school. I was so honored to be accepted.   It seems everyone around me has great friends and is thriving. Academically I'm not as fulfilled or challenged as  I'd like to be.

My parent is supportive of whatever I want to do. My siblings, both 5+ years older, were also in selective universities. They suggested that I immerse myself fully at Tufts and if I feel the same next year, that a transfer makes sense at that time.  I'm lonely, stressed and I feel like everyone around me is having the best life ever. I feel like people make fun of me and only professors take me seriously.  

I've never thought of myself as poor or even middle class. But the extreme wealth among the student body, and the way in which they flaunt their wealth is startling.  Some students genuinely seem out of touch.

Any suggestions? Anyone else transfer from Tufts?  I'm from another state but I love the Boston area.  I'm not just sitting in my dorm room. I'm out, and I actively try to engage, but I feel like I'm on the periphery of any group instead if really being a part of any group.  I just want a couple of really great friends.  Others say that with time, that will come. But this is rough.

Is this just a Tufts thing, or is it a freshman thing?

For anyone who felt this way and stuck it out, what tips do you have?  For anyone who DID transfer, where did you end up? Thanks

I'm currently trying to make the most out of the university I'm currently attending, but it's extremely underfunded in the arts department, and Tufts seems like one of the few unis that has a pretty good balance between both the arts and academics.

Nitpicky grading - CS department? All departments at Tufts? Bad luck?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/178ppva/nitpicky_grading_cs_department_all_departments_at/,1,6,2023-10-15 21:34:20,"I’m a grad student in the CS department. About 50% of the classes I’ve taken at Tufts have had some pretty ludicrous grading practices, or at the very least, poor communication between the instructors and the students as to what is actually expected in a submission. You can follow their instructions exactly, but still be docked points for some criterion in the grading rubric that was never mentioned in the assignment instructions. I’ve basically accepted that I’ll have to tank the first assignment/quiz/etc to figure out what the instructors expect in our solutions, regardless of the instructions they provide. This was never an issue at my undergraduate institution.

Does anybody else feel this way about the CS department, or the university as a whole? Or have I just been unlucky?"

They're in DC in a couple days, they were in Boston last year, they're going to be in Boston again in a month marching to the Common to make a speech. Total downer.

So, just like last year, we've put together a merry band of clowns to play circus music the whole way! Hopefully we can brighten up these guys' day. We can use all the help be can get - if you play an instrument, great, if not, your mistakes will only add to our authentic clown charm.

For context:

I'm currently #1 on waitlist for PSY 32 (Experimental PSY), which happened to me last semester and of course I didn't get in. There's a hope within me that I'll get off but I don't really think it will happen.

I'm thinking of dropping waitlist for PSY32 and replacing it for waitlist in CS170, which unfortunately has 27 people on the waitlist. The only thing I really have going for me to get in to the class was the fact that last semester, those not given admission into 40 would be guaranteed admission into 160 or 170, but I have already reached out to the professor twice (once at the beginning of the summer, again earlier this month) and have received no response. 

As a result, I don't really want to abandon my chances of getting into either class that at this point I'm thinking of petitioning for more credits since I'm literally leaving for abroad next semester and need to get these courses done regardless.

Does anyone whose been in a similar situation or has petitioned for extra credits have any insight or advice? As for the latter, I noticed that the petitioning page only has options for Distribution/Culture/World Civ, so would I have to petition for a class that is one of these instead? Instructions are a little unclear,  so any help would be great, thanks."

best & worst bathrooms on campus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/1625nf1/best_worst_bathrooms_on_campus/,19,10,2023-08-26 20:25:19,"Hi all,

Since the semester is starting very soon, I figured it would be nice to have a thread on bathrooms on campus. I've found that the difference in bathroom quality across the Tufts campus is disparate, so it would be good to vent and inform incoming students.

Here are some of my thoughts, which are focused on women's/unisex bathrooms:

**Tisch Library**: The single-stall unisex bathrooms on the main (second) floor are decent because the locks on the outside indicate vacancy and there are tables inside (good for coats and bags), but there's usually a line for these bathrooms. If you use women's restrooms, I would avoid the ones on the first floor or at least use caution. It smells like pee, the ground is usually wet, and there aren't coat hooks within each stall. These are the some of the worst bathrooms I've encountered on campus yet. The women's bathrooms on the ground and third floors have been fine. There are paper towels available in all (unisex/women's) bathrooms in Tisch.

**Pearson**: This building is in need of updating, including the bathrooms. The women's bathroom is right across the hall from a large lecture room so people may watch you go in. There are coat hooks outside the stalls.

**Joyce Cummings Center**: This building is very new so the bathrooms feel clean and modern. There are usually quite a few people using them. Unfortunately, only air driers are available here so it can be loud and overwhelming to use these bathrooms.

**SEC/Anderson/Robinson**: This weird Frankenstein of a building joins two older halls together, with bathrooms available in both the old and new portions. Again, the new bathrooms are generally nice but I've ran into mechanical issues with the faucets and have found that they run out of soap/paper towels often. The best kept secret of the SEC are the single-stall unisex bathrooms in Anderson(?) - which may or may not be on every floor (I haven't looked). They are somewhat tucked away and are large. However, I *think* there may not be feminine product disposal bins in these bathrooms (IIRC) and the trash bins are far enough away from the toilets that it can be a pain to dispose of those products effortlessly. Also, no coat hooks.

Those are the only places I've gotten to spend time in, so I encourage other students to share their experiences!"
Engineering and Double Majors at Tufts - How Difficult Is It?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/161vixp/engineering_and_double_majors_at_tufts_how/,1,3,2023-08-26 13:39:47,"Hello! I'm a HS senior planning on applying to Tufts this fall. I plan on pursuing an Engineering degree (haven't decided on which one yet, but probably EE or ME) yet I also want to double major in either biology or biotech. I know this is technically doable, but just how difficult would it be? Would I have to take extra classes and/or summer classes? Would I have to sacrifice study abroad or other opportunities? I'm willing to do the hard work and make sacrifices but I want to have an idea of what I'm preparing myself for.

Some additional information: 

- I will have some AP credits (5s in AP Bio, AP Calc AB, and APUSH, a 4 in AP lang, and planning on taking AP Calc BC, AP Comp Sci Principles, and AP Lit as well as possibly some college classes at a local community college) so yhat could lessen my workload I guess. 
- I plan on going into bioengineering research (specifically stuff like tissue, cell, and genetic engineering) and on getting a PhD, and while I know Tufts has a biomedical engineering bachelor's I've heard it's better to get a different bachelor's degree and then get a BME Graduates Degree. I'm hoping to do the 4+1 BME Master's at Tufts if I go to Tufts. 

If you've done a double major with an engineering major at Tufts, I'll really appreciate your advice!"

Tufts Silencing of Victims of Sexual Harassment,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/149csgf/tufts_silencing_of_victims_of_sexual_harassment/,49,1,2023-06-14 16:50:10,"TW: Sexual harassment, institutional invalidation. Particularly triggering details are hidden behind spoiler tags, which you can skip. 

This is posted here because I believe Tufts’ office of equal opportunity (OEO) failed me by telling me to pretend my harasser was a “past boyfriend” to “avoid drama”, and I want to tell anyone that has had to go to OEO that you should be able to share your experiences and rely on those around you for support. 

About a year ago, I was sexually harassed by someone I was stuck on a year-long group project at Tufts. >!He “subtly” performed sexual acts to himself in when alone working on the project and touched me without my consent!<. At the time, I was suffering from a chronic medical condition and didn’t have the strength to hold my boundaries when he would be sobbing about me rejecting him. 

At some point, I finally yelled at him to stop. He continued to harass me in written communications, >!threatening suicide or harm to others!< because of how I shut him down. When I went to OEO, my experience was awful. 

OEO told me to pretend my harasser was an ex-boyfriend, since “drama” would make the whole thing worse. In essence, I was told to not reach our to friends or family for support and to protect my harasser. Honestly, at the time I was so laser-focused on getting a no contact order that I agreed. 

It was really, really difficult for me emotionally to keep his harassment a secret, and resulted in me isolating myself from friends and family, but I want to focus a bit more on moving on. The most important part of my healing journey was when I finally started opening up to others:  telling others what I experienced and hearing them be angry for me or telling me that it wasn’t okay made me realize that it was alright that my experiences affected me, and that it was bullshit to have been silenced. 

If anyone else has had to interact with OEO for any similar issue, I want you to know that they are not necessarily going to be there to advocate for you. They may force you into silence, or protect your harasser. This is never okay. Being silent about a situation can only help your harasser and help the people who are paid to provide support not do their jobs. 

If you find yourself in a similar situation, I want to tell you to open up to your friends or whoever you are comfortable talking to (or, heck, even anonymously on reddit). When I was going through all this, I didn’t realize what I was feeling and thought that it was probably no big deal because that’s how it was treated by who I thought would advocate for me. Please, please know that  that however you struggle through sexual harassment is valid and your experiences deserve to be talked about. 

Thank you for reading, and please look out for yourself! If you would like, you can share any experiences you’ve had below, or DM me if  you feel that you’re in early stages of reaching out for support."

My daughter is deciding between Tufts and William and Mary, and two of the biggest differences are class size and student/teacher ratio, with Tufts considerably better.

I got into Tufts which is a very solid choice but I wanted to understand if it makes sense to go through with it or not. 

I am majoring in Economics and Computer Science with a minor in Data Science and would plan on at least completing the double major at Tufts. My reasons for transferring include the mediocre Econ and CS program at BU as well as the large school size. 

I hope to go into consulting straight out of college. I was hoping to also understand how much more of a target school tufts would be considered in comparison to BU. 

Now to get to the hardest part of the decision, the activities I have tied to BU and my own goals within them. Some of them are might-be’s and I have attached the expected probability associated with it. Here I was hoping to understand if Tufts can justify giving these up to start fresh. 

**On-Campus Consulting Group** 

* We work pro-bono with different companies. 
* **Goal:** I expect to have an EBoard position by junior year and may even run President/VP

 **Economics Research (80% likely)**

* I would be working over this summer as a Research Assistant with a professor 
* **Goal:** Convert it into a research opportunity during the fall semester

**On-Campus Voluntary Tutoring club (90% likely)**

* President and founder of a club I plan on registering during the coming summer

**Computer Science Research (50% likely)**

* During the coming fall I would be doing research with a CS professor with regard to machine learning 

**Computer Science Course Assistant (50% likely)**

* I would be a CA for an introductory CS course 

And another thing that may be hard to quantify is obviously all the connections I would lose throughout BU which I believe is a good network. Any and all help would be appreciated, thanks in advance!"

Tufts Software Systems Development vs Virginia Tech Meng CS,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tufts/comments/12dretu/tufts_software_systems_development_vs_virginia/,1,4,2023-04-06 17:28:46,"Hello Jumbos,  
   
I have received offers from both Virginia Tech and Tufts University for their respective programs, and I'm seeking some advice.

I've heard that Tufts has decent course quality in their Computer Science program, with ample TA hours and smaller class sizes, which means more resources for students. However, Tufts is not particularly known for its engineering programs in CS (correct me if I'm wrong).

On the other hand, I've heard that Virginia Tech has a strong reputation for its CS department in the industry. However, I'll be attending the NCR campus, where most courses are offered virtually and campus life would be minimal. I'm concerned if this would impact my learning experience and if there would be fewer resources for job searching and other activities.

My goal is to land a job after graduation, and I have no intention to work on research at the moment. I would greatly appreciate any comments or thoughts from people who have experience with these programs, especially in terms of job opportunities and campus resources at Tufts. Thank you in advance!"
