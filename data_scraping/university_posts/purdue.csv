Do you like getting screwed by Google?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1gqgnq9/do_you_like_getting_screwed_by_google/,20,9,2024-11-13 16:20:05,"I don’t. But every time I go on it to search for flights home I take an L. Yes, this is another clickbait ad for Purdue’s [Jumpseat](https://purdue.jumpseatapp.com/search) website (previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1fjuhzb/fuck\_boilerbookings/), but keep reading because it’s about to get spicy…

Every year, Purdue OOS students spend almost $8M on flights. That is double Ryan Walters’ salary. But we can actually do something about the former now.

For the last few months, we’ve been cooking up something that we think will actually change things. We’ve put out some pretty cool features before, got a bunch of users, but nothing really compares to this.

We’ve made a discount algorithm that literally gives Purdue students cheaper winter break flights.

Basically, Jumpseat bets on the airline’s price dropping later, but you don’t have to worry about any of that. You get the best rate we can offer immediately. If prices drop further, Jumpseat comes out ahead. If prices don’t, we take the hit. Either way, you get the lowest price without the stress and the risk.

I want to be clear that this isn’t just another price drop protection or reimbursement feature. These deals mean you simply pay less right now. Period.

On average, each discounted flight is **\~15% cheaper than Google Flights**, which means they're also cheaper than the airline/Kayak/Expedia. And here’s our guarantee: if you find a lower rate on Google Flights for a flight, we’ll not only pay you the difference—we’ll add an extra 30% off that flight.

Right now, we have enough data to support winter break travel dates to 15 of the biggest US airports. Contact us with questions/feedback please: [team@jumpseatapp.com](mailto:team@jumpseatapp.com). I expect a few bugs on launch day so if you've got a few minutes to stress test it, it'd be much appreciated.

TLDR: We have discovered a groundbreaking way to take our gambling addiction to the next level. Check it out here: [purdue.jumpseatapp.com/search](https://purdue.jumpseatapp.com/search)

We met during bgr and started dating shortly  after, and its been great. However, there's one issue that's bothering me. He is always touching his other guy friends in weird ways. Him and his friends live in two suites in Cary and frequently hang out in each other's rooms. I've walked in on them grabbing each others asses, spanking, and even touching and rubbing each other's chests. I've also seen them making kissing gestures, and my boyfriend mentioned that they sometimes wake each other up by jumping on the person who's sleeping. They often make comments like ""I'm going to give you the best blowjob tonight"" and other sexual jokes. Is this typical behavior for guys? I mentioned it to a friend, and she said it seemed really odd and not normal. I'm unsure how to feel about it."

Purdue Basketball Report Card ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1gw3427/purdue_basketball_report_card/,32,0,2024-11-21 00:32:53,"Braden Smith - A 

Smith has hustled to keep Purdue in every game this season. Sometimes when I watch Purdue play, I’ll keep my eyes on Smith even if he doesn't have the ball or is guarding the ball handler. His decision making is perfect, finding times to squeeze out a steal or rebound or anything he can. You can’t be mad at a 15/9/6 stat line from your point guard. 

The only issue is that he gets pressured so much with the ball. Marquette took advantage of his small size and hedged nearly every screen as aggressively as possible. Often, Smith would be doubled coming off the screen and wouldn’t be able to make the pass to the rolling big man. He was clearly gassed at the end of the Marquette game. 

Despite his struggles on ball, he ended up trying to bring off ball value. Getting open for threes that kept Purdue in the game. Maybe the answer is to pull Smith off ball more. I think Purdue should have someone else bring the ball up the court and hand it to Smith. The Nuggets would do this with Murray to keep him fresh. 



CJ Cox - A- 

To start the year, Cox was a stout defender. He would pressure the ball handler and got several steals in his first two games. Then switched to being an energizing scorer in the next two games, hitting crucial threes against Alabama to win us the game. Cox is the reason Purdue beat Alabama. 

And what does Painter do? He rewards him with half the minutes against Marquette. I have no clue why Painter doesn’t want to play Cox, especially with Harris providing zero offensive or defensive value. I suspect that Painter might have guaranteed a starting spot to Harris when recruiting him because there is zero reason not to be starting Cox right now. 

Having another ball handler next to Smith could be vital. In fact, I would like to see Smith play more off ball while Cox carries the ball up the court. He’s quicker than Smith and is able to punish aggressive defense better. 



Trey Kaufman-Renn - B+ 

I can’t complain with TKRs performance this year. He is slowly filling Edey’s spot as the paint scorer on the team, but he had trouble when facing a good defender in Cliff Omoruyi. He also isn’t as efficient as Edey, not that anybody was, but he does need to fix his shot selection a bit. TKR needs to learn to punish the defense when they decide to double Smith and the ball is passed to him. 

I also cannot blame him for anything defensively because he has to keep switching between the 4 and 5 regularly in games. Painter just doesn’t want to play small ball with Heide at the four, but Berg, Furst and Burgess all have issues. 



Fletcher Loyer - B+ 

Loyer has done his job on offense. He hits open shots and has learned how to take advantage of the defense when he needs to. I love his pump fake dribble pull up. I have no qualms with him on the offensive end. 

On the defensive end, however, it is much of the same for Loyer. He can get bullied and pushed around by strong guards. I don’t think its a glaring issue for the team, but he does cap the defensive potential for this team. 



Camden Heide - B (A for effort tho) 

Heide has stepped up where he is needed. He has gotten aggressive at rebounding, he’s giving it his all on defense and he’s hit threes. He’s made some bone headed plays but when he is out there he plays hard. 

I think Painter should do the uncomfortable and start a small ball lineup. With Heide at the four, this is an unusually small team for Painter, but its our best lineup. And with more time on the court, TKR and Heide will get better at their defensive assignments. Purdue has been pretty good at switching which gives me hope for a small ball lineup.   
  


Myles Colvin - B 

I have been very impressed with Colvin’s defensive improvement this year. With Morton gone, Painter has decided to sub Colvin in for Loyer on defensive possessions. At times he will fade to the background and not know what to do. Colvin needs to learn to be a role player, but I have hope for him going forward. 

Like Heide he could start for a lesser Big Ten team. But for now, I want to see him get a larger and larger role with the bench till he proves he deserves Loyer’s spot. 



Caleb Furst - C 

Furst has not gotten a lick better since his freshman year. He is still the same player. He’s not bad but his instincts are not there. He doesn’t have many moves in the paint and this leads to numerous blocked shots. 

Defensively he is lost at times and he doesn’t defend the paint any better than TKR. I think he’s a better four but not with TKR. He just doesn’t play well with any big man on the roster.  



Needs improvement - Berg, Burgess and Harris 

Berg is what IU fans think Edey is, just tall. He is suppose to have an outside shot but has yet to deliver a three pointer. On defense he tries hard but is often out of position. And he’s being out rebounded by Heide who is 7 inches shorter. Ultimately, I think he needs more time on court to get used to a college pace. 

Burgess has had some highlights but defensively is the worst big man on the team. The plan was to red-shirt him but now he needs to play for the bench. I still think he will be a great player but so far its been difficult. 

Harris has been non-existent. He is a turnstile on defense, he can’t hit shots, and is overall just bad. If I were the coach I would have benched him for Cox or Colvin. My theory is that Painter promised him a starting spot, something he says he doesn't do. 



Going forward I hope Painter starts the small ball lineup and gives Cox a starting spot. I think there is hope for a strong finish to the year as this roster is incredibly young. I don't worry about the Marquette loss, but they did exploit issues with our team.

If you are using a cable lock to secure your bike, get a sturdy U lock or chain lock. It's a small investment that will help protect the much larger investment of your bike. Lock the frame and rear wheel to the rack with the chain lock or U lock, and lock the front wheel and the frame to the rack with the cable lock. This makes it more difficult to steal and has the added bonus of preventing the bike from being knocked over. And if you have an expensive bike, I'd consider bringing it inside overnight since this is when the majority of bike thefts occur."

He’s interested in becoming either an industrial engineer, a materials engineer, or a civil engineer.

Could you please help an old guy out and let me know what he should aim for in terms of GPA, recommendation letters, and activities?

**here is some background to give some insight:**

 i am a senior in CGT (specifically web programming and design) graduating in may. i'm a low-income first-generation student fully funded through scholarships, and i work two jobs. my first job is a web developer / video editor (giving me first hand experience in my field), and the other being a supervisor at starbucks. i will have been at my web dev job for 1.5 years and at starbucks for 2.5 years when graduation rolls around. i also will have three years of club leadership experience, being film crew president for a club here on campus (tldr: i film and edit k-pop dance music videos). my college experience has been interesting to say the least (poverty, disabilities, family illness and deaths, etc.), and unfortunately because of that, i only have a 2.9 GPA. i have brought this up considerably since freshman year, but i'm still a bit disappointed by this number, considering that i did very well in high school. i understand that they are completely different/not comparable, but i naturally tend to have high expectations for myself to keep myself motivated enough to get out of the situation that i am in. 

**here's what i need advice on:** 

theoretically, i could make it to a 3.0 gpa by graduation, however, i would need to bust my ass and do extremely well in spring semester, on top of two jobs, applying to careers, working on portfolio projects, my senior capstone project, etc.  i honestly do not know if it would be worth it to stretch myself even thinner than i already am and commit to 70-80 hour work weeks just to raise my gpa by .1 by graduation. is there a big enough difference between a 2.9 and a 3.0 that i should go for it? obviously i am going to try my hardest regardless, but this would be a bit of a big undertaking. i understand that some places only hire/accept people with a 3.0 or higher, and i am very worried about applying to jobs soon, especially since the job market in tech is lowkey cooked rn 💀 

**tldr:** how much weight does a 0.1 GPA difference carry in the hiring process, (especially in tech jobs like web development) and can experience/club/portfolio work substitute for this difference? 

i'd totally ask a friend or family or anyone irl that i know, but since i'm a first gen student, i don't know anyone that could help me out with this tbh : (  
   
any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. thanks much!! : D"

Now, the deadline for priority applications is just around the corner and I'm just working on getting my recommendation letters sent. I had hoped I'd have been able to get the fee before now, but the economy happened and there is no way I could get the money in time. So, I decided to write to apply for an application fee waiver.

Anyway, I'm asking for tips, do I have any chance of getting in, and do you have any tips of what I could include in the request mail to waive the application fees? The mail is ready, and I'll send it in just a few hours, but I thought of checking if I'd get any tips from here first.

I’m a CS major working on a project. Its purpose is to be a one stop shop for all the useful information and opinions on Purdue professors that you can find on the internet. You search for a professor’s name and a collection of all this information comes up.

Right now, I’m in the development phase of this project. I have a webpage design and a few features, including an AI summary of a professor’s reviews and a list of the average GPA for each of their classes. 

If this idea is supported, I’ll continue adding more features. A few concepts I had were a feature that tracks how opinions on a professor change over time, a place to describe course structure(how many midterms, homework, etc), and the ability to rank professors like a leaderboard.

Please let me know if you like this idea, and if you don’t, I’d love it if you could tell me why and give suggestions for how this could be more useful. Your feedback will help me decide on how much effort I should put into this and if I should change anything.

And if you want to collaborate in any way, feel free to reach out! Open to whatever as of right now.

My poor bike :(,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gtuq3n,106,45,2024-11-18 02:42:45,"Hey if u guys see my bike around,  I'll pay $100 to whoever brings it back to me, even if you were the one who stole it. I just want it back. My mom helped me pay for it. It was last seen on the north east bike rack of Harrison, Nov 13th. I already filed a police report the day of, and I have called all the bike shops to let the cops know if they see the bike. I have the bikes serial number, so if u scrape it off, or leave it on, they're gonna know it's stolen and call me, then the cops will arrest you. I have been going through FB marketplace every day, so count your days. I don't want you to get arrested whoever stole it, but if I find you riding it in the future, or I see it on a bike rack, and you haven't made any effort to give it back, I will be pressing charges, which will be a class A misdemeanor, which will get you expelled. I don't want that, don't make me do that. I have a cheap bike you can have if you really want a bike, I saved up for the one you stole, and used birthday money for it so it really sucks. It's only a matter of time, unless you shove it in a basement and never use it. If you guys know any other websites or locations that I could check out for my bike let me know, anything is appreciated. It was locked up to the bike rack, with not the greatest lock, but it was still cut which sucks. I'm going to start tweaking soon, so preferably give it back soon. I fell off the bike on the left side so the left peddle is scraped up and where the wires for the brakes go into the bike are almost cut since they got pinched between the ground and the bike when I fell. I think the left handle bar is scraped as well on the side that would hit the ground. Please help me out guys."

Purdue vs lions redemption?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1gtktbt/purdue_vs_lions_redemption/,11,0,2024-11-17 19:00:37,"With the abysmal performance seen on the field Saturday afternoon, Purdue's hopes of having one decent game were dashed. 

Wanting to give students and fans something to cheer for, Walter's spent all night wheeling and dealing and his efforts paid off.

This morning the Boilers sought to recover their dignity by stepping onto the field against 11 real lions.

It was shaping up to be a good game. While the lions can run at 50 mph their small hearts, lungs, and few sweat glands make their endurance quite low. 

However, the lions 18 claws and bite force of 1000 psi means the Boilers have to show a strong defense, lest they be torn to shreds. 

In a powerful opening move the Boilers won the coin toss but chose to receive in an attempt to sacrifice the defense in an effort to maintain a strong offense.

A powerful opening kick attempted to put the lions on the back paw but the lions opted for a touchback. 

In the first play the lions ripped into the right side of the Boilers' defensive line, creating an opening in both the line and those players. 

The lion's ball carrier made a short trot to the Boilers' 40 yard line before finally being brought down. It became clear that the 500 pounds of muscle would pose a problem to the defense. 

With early substitutions being made the lions easily passed the 20 yard line. 

Some resting on the lions part allowed the Boilers to force a 4th down on the 15th but they were fooled by a fake field goal leading to a early 6 point lead (after a failed kick from the lions).

The offense hesitantly took to the field against the lions who were not nearly as tired as they were hoping for. 

A short kick from the lions placed Purdue on the 40 and they set up in a position to maximize their passing game. 

While their first pass was successful the receiver made it less than 10 yards before being pounced on by the lions.

One of the lions refused to release his leg and was flagged giving the Boilers a first down and a 10 yard advance. 

Hoping their luck was changing Purdue switched to running plays, but the lions are known for their strong defense. 

And several plays and 7 substitutions later the Boilers found themselves running out of players and on the 22nd yard line.

Walters and the lion's coach agreed to end the match in 1 quarter due to concerns for the health of both teams.

Facing hopeless options Purdue pulled off a miracle pass into the endzone, putting pressure on the kicker to sink the game. 
In a deeply embarrassing move the ball went straight into the lions face, bounced off, and smacked our kicker in the helmet. A fumble was called and the lions returned the ball for a second field goal.

While the Boilers survived the game, their hopes surely didn't. Proving the lions had the only claim to a pride.

Editors note- there have since been 4 amputations. This is not expected to severely worsen the Boilers performance in the upcoming games.

Giving a thumbs down like a roman emperor watching a gladiator match. This has been Purdue’s Peter reporting. "

I feel so fucking stupid. I just took my 2nd Rizzology midterm and I totally flopped.

I sat down on the 3rd row of Elliot to take my test and as I pulled out my exam, I realized that my fly was down (a 15% grade deduction). I was mortified. I then collected myself and began leafing through the test packet.

What on earth is edgemaxxing?? What the FUCK is a skibidi toilet? I felt my heart drop as I realized that I was totally unprepared. I completed the questions I could answer (which was a limited amount) and turned in the test. I cried my eyes out the entire way back to my room in Mung’s basement.

I feel so betrayed because I watched all of the lecture videos (which were mostly oiled up twerking compilations) and took EXTENSIVE notes. I read countless Reddit threads on how to effortlessly approach women and exude sigma energy.

I don't know what I'm going to do now. I don't have enough units to maintain my enrollment so I am being forced to go back home and start my career as a potato farmer in Ohio.

This is a warning.

There is an event that will celebrate transgender community and existence that is being planned from around **6:30-8:30 pm at the clapping circle** that will feature speakers concerning topics such as transgender/third gender history, gender theory, reading poetry, and other interesting topics. Please come if you're available and not too busy! 

  
Although this event falls on the same day as a different speaker coming to Purdue, this event is not an act of protest to that event. We will be commemorating and honoring victims of injustice. Once again, we hope you come!"

Spotify Extremely Slow on PAL,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1gskh2k/spotify_extremely_slow_on_pal/,17,4,2024-11-16 10:22:12,"Is anyone else having issues with Spotify being super slow? On both my laptop and phone, it takes around a minute to load my playlists or even start playing a song. Pausing or playing also lags by a couple of seconds. I asked some friends, and they’re having the same problem. I’m wondering if it’s because Spotify is trying to find people on the network to 'join their Jam' and pal doesn't like that or maybe PAL 3.0 is throttling Spotify connections? If I use a VPN, everything works perfectly and loads instantly. Does anyone know a fix for this? Is there a way to tell spotify to not look for local devices?"

The syllabus doesn’t show anything with the +/-, only solid letter grades. 

Does this mean there are no +/- grades for 2k1 this semester? 

I’m currently sitting in the low 70s, right where the cutoff between a C and a C- would be without a curve. I’m stressing because this is my third and final attempt at this class, and I can’t get a C-. It has to be a solid C.

Since the first midterm average was so high (75), I’m not betting on a curve (even though the second midterm average was only a 46). 


Anyone know if the grading scales have changed for 2k1 this semester? Are they still using +/-, or is 70-79 all considered a C?"

However, I struggled to the point where I just had to seek help (the alternative was to keep fighting on my own and succeed, or lose and potentially drop out of school). The first therapy session has ""oddly"" made me feel better about everything. I think it was mainly because I was able to talk to someone as I had no one else to talk to. And to my (great) surprise, I was comfortable enough to share things. I guess this is a positive start, and I hope things will get better from now on. I've never realized the extent of human complexity until probably now. I understood it, but I just didn't actively think about it. Reflecting on some of the questions asked in the session, humans are indeed emotionally and logically complex creatures. I hope that anyone who is struggling out there can also find the help they need. There's no shame in doing so (I've realized this too late)."

Purdue is hosting an anti-trans activist on trans day of visibility,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1gs6t7h/purdue_is_hosting_an_antitrans_activist_on_trans/,107,548,2024-11-15 21:10:09,"Riley Gaines, a former swimmer and current anti-trans activist, has a speaking event next Wednesday, which is also trans day of remembrance, a day to celebrate and promote trans identities and to remember those who have lost their lives to various forms of transphobia.

Two years ago, Gaines tied for fifth in a race with trans woman Lia Thomas. They were both beaten by four other women, all cisgender. Gaines used this tie as a platform to start a campaign of anti-transgender activism. She claims to be protecting female athletes from the supposed unfair advantage that trans women have in sports, but she is openly transphobic towards trans women, openly and explicitly misgendering them. She also helped advocate for the exclusion of trans women from women's chess, a ban that was controversial not only because of its transphobic origins but because of the implication that men have an inherent advantage in chess, a game that relies on mental, not physical, capabilities.

Trans women who have been on HRT (hormone replacement therapy) for significant periods of time do not have a proven advantage in physical sports (trans women who are not on HRT do not have any notable history of being allowed on women's teams at all that I'm aware of). Trans women are not disproportionately represented in victories in women's sports. HRT, which increases estrogen levels and lowers testosterone levels, causes body mass redistribution and makes it harder to build and maintain muscle. This typically decreases trans women's performance in sports (Thomas, for example, had times that were slower than they had been when she had competed in the men's division before beginning HRT).

I find it extremely disheartening that Gaines' misinformation and transphobia is being given a platform at Purdue. To my fellow trans students: know you still have a space and community here. You are loved and you are valid.

Edit: I misspoke, Wednesday is trans day of remembrance, not visibility, which I've edited in my post to have the correct info. Unfortunately, the title can't be changed. All of my other points still stand."

Purdue Readmission Rejected Again,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1gsa0wd/purdue_readmission_rejected_again/,27,33,2024-11-15 23:35:52,"I’m in a really tough spot right now and could use some advice. I was previously a student at Purdue, studying Agricultural Economics, but I was academically separated from the university more than 3 semesters ago. While I was there, I was working towards changing my major to Industrial Engineering (IE). After being separated, I decided to focus on getting readmitted back into Agricultural Economics, and I’ve been trying to get back into Purdue since Fall 2023.

The thing is, I’ve already completed over 3 years' worth of courses for the IE degree, and I only have about 1.5 years left to finish. Despite this, I was just denied admission again. What’s really heartbreaking is that a decision was made on my application even though I haven’t turned in my grades for this semester yet. It feels like I didn’t even get a fair chance to show my recent progress.

I’ve already emailed the Purdue admissions office, hoping they would consider waiting for my current semester grades before making a final decision, but I haven’t gotten a response yet. I also tried to appeal the decision using the online form, but when I clicked on the link, it was no longer available. As a last resort, I’m planning on going to Purdue in person to try and meet with someone who can help, but I’m not sure if that will make a difference.

Has anyone been through something similar or have any advice on what I can do? I am very close to getting my Degree and would like to get it in Purdue. If there are any specific departments or people at Purdue that might be able to help, I’d really appreciate any guidance. I’m feeling lost and overwhelmed, and any advice or support would mean so much.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Edit: I have meet all the requirements for re-admission and already got a decision letter. I am only interested in getting an IE degree. I have also heard from a friend that readmission is not possible if you have been rejected 2 times, however they were not sure if it is true or not."

Purdue Fast Track Program,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1gra66q/purdue_fast_track_program/,0,9,2024-11-14 17:30:24,"Why does nobody talk about the Purdue Fast Track program. It feels like such a big loophole that everyone should take advantage of. Read about it here: [https://www.admissions.purdue.edu/purduefaststart/](https://www.admissions.purdue.edu/purduefaststart/)

But basically, you get assured admission into Purdue by ""...passing five Modern States courses, the corresponding CLEP College Board exams, and meeting Purdue's standard admissions requirements.""



It defines it as:   
Assured admission is to Purdue University — West Lafayette Main Campus, a Purdue regional campus, or one of the Purdue Statewide locations around the state of Indiana - but exact major selection is not guaranteed. 



I believe this means that you get to pick what campus you want from those options, but your major isn't guaranteed. Other than that, it doesn't seem to have any big ""catch"". Is anyone going/have gone through this program currently/before? Is it legit? I'm asking because I'm interested in Computer Science, which is obviously a really competitive major in Purdue.

"The Exponent reported and widely distributed misinformation about Yue Yin on Election Day, but has refused to issue a public apology",https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1gq5jst/the_exponent_reported_and_widely_distributed/,493,79,2024-11-13 05:13:40,"On Election Day, as a candidate for the West Lafayette school board, I stood approximately 100 feet from the City Hall entrance, [handing out flyers](https://www.purdueexponent.org/yue-yin-handing-out-door-tags/video_7d8d615a-9b9d-11ef-ae48-bff6282cd678.html)—a distance that more than doubles the 50-foot requirement outlined in election regulations. Many other candidates were also campaigning near polling stations, as reported in [The Exponent](https://www.purdueexponent.org/lafayette-voting-election-purdue/article_d3121e30-9b85-11ef-ade6-bbb93022f632.html).

Around noon, a student journalist from *The Exponent* approached me with questions about my candidacy. Besides answering his questions, I expressed my appreciation for *The Exponent*'s role in promoting transparency within our district. We had a pleasant conversation, and he asked to photograph my flyers, which I agreed to without hesitation. As a professor myself, I always love to communicate with students and support them. At no point did the journalist raise concerns about possible election-related misconduct.

Soon after, *The Exponent* published an article with the headline: “West Lafayette school board candidate Yue Yin is handing out door tags to voters at a voting location, which may be a crime under Indiana election law.” I was shocked and frustrated by this misinformation, as I fully complied with the law and went beyond the requirements by standing twice as far from the entrance as required. If the journalist had shared any concerns, I would have clarified that I followed all legal guidelines. Given that he was unsure, he also could have checked with the election officers on-site who monitor campaign activities, rather than publishing a ""maybe crime"" accusation.

This misinformation was posted on *The Exponent*'s website and on X, immediately gaining thousands of views. While many others were busy handing out campaign materials at polling stations, including another one at City Hall, who stood much closer to the entrance than I did. I was singled out with a ""maybe crime"" accusation for doing the same as everyone else. Consequently, I had to spend time then calling around to repair the damage to my reputation, feeling distressed and desperate, because I value my integrity deeply. I don't want it tarnished by a baseless accusation.

I called *The Exponent*, who only told me to wait for their editor's response. I contacted the election office, reporting the inaccurate article. The election office reviewed the report and confirmed that I had not violated any rules. An election officer then called and finally prompted the *Exponent* to correct their error.

*The Exponent* eventually published a follow-up post stating that I did not break the law, but they left the original misinformation on their website, X, and many other news outlets. As of November 6, this misinformation on X had received nearly 7,000 views and was reposted on many other news sites, including those out of state.

Starting the next day, I asked *The Exponent* to take three actions:

1. Delete their “maybe crime” accusation from their website, X, and the various outlets where it was reposted.
2. Issue a public apology to repair the damage to my reputation.
3. Explain how this situation occurred.

After days of communication with *The Exponent*, they refused to retract the reposted misinformation or issue a public apology. Finally, I reached out to the CEO and publisher of *The Exponent*. He led his team to work with their provider to remove the misinformation from partner sites and sent me a personal apology. However, *The Exponent* still refused to issue a public apology. While I appreciate the CEO’s personal apology, only a public apology can help reduce the damage to my reputation.

*The original Exponent* report included another person who was also handing out flyers to support other school board candidates at the same time and location as me, yet did not question him. After I complained about their mis-accusation of me and the contrast, the Exponent deleted their report on the other person completely.

The original post on X received 6,728 views, compared to only 1,483 views for the correction—a difference of over 5,000 views. This gap likely includes readers who now hold a mistaken perception of my actions on Election Day. I’ve already heard from a friend who was told by others that I broke the law on Election Day.

As a result, I now feel stressed and pressured to explain this situation to everyone I know. However, I cannot possibly reach the thousands of *Exponent* readers who saw the misinformation. *The Exponent* is the only party with the means to notify at least some of them by issuing a public apology to me, but they have refused to do so.

In this Election, I was the only Asian candidate in West Lafayette, a city where more than 20% of residents are Asian. Many members of the Asian community, upon learning about this situation, emailed *The Exponent* to express concern over the irresponsible reporting, insufficient correction, or the lack of apology. None of them received a response from *The Exponent* so far.

I am sharing my experience here to hopefully lessen the harm done to my reputation and to the Asian community by *The Exponent*’s misinformation and lack of a public apology.

Thank you for taking the time to read my clarification. If you know others who read *The Exponent*, please help me by sharing my clarification. Thank you very much!

Riley Gaines is most famous for tying for 5th place at a swim meet one time with a trans woman and turning that experience into a lifelong hustle. 

The event promises to take back Title IX which does not include trans athletes and hasn’t been “taken” from ciswomen ever. In fact, the only one challenging title IX and threatening to dismantle it are the very conservative politicians these same women campaigned for. 

Riley’s events typically consist of her regaling the time she lost a swim meet (to a trans woman who would like to remain out of the public eye and has since not swam in a competitive level) and had a trophy mailed to her instead of handed to her immediately with increasing levels of drama and then throwing around conservative fear mongering and buzzwords in the hopes she’ll scare someone into giving her more money so she never has to get a real job.

We count on their kindness and help to get us where we need to go, but with all the modified routes right now due to construction I'm hitting max wait times for transfers most days. I value all of the drivers' hard work above all else and always show respect but not all of them show equal care or patience in return.

so there is someone I have known basically since middle school and we were pretty much best friends until we came to Purdue - she naturally found her own friend group and unfortunately I didnt fit too well with this new group. that was fine and all, but eventually I found her completely cutting me off, something I never expected her to do. And, here's the part that sucks - at some point she told me to ""not talk for a while"". While I am somehow trying to respect that, I keep running into her (like common areas), and it really pains me to see her and her new group chat away while I just sit at a distance (with my group) wondering if I really know/knew this person.

I just want advice on what to do in this situation. Do I just accept that the ship has sailed and try to move on? Or do I try to reach out, at worst one last time, to have a conversation about it?

Again, she's no villain, but i guess i'm just miserable that i never got closure for such a valuable friendship. there are many parts of this story that i'm leaving out, but I'll just disclose that I am a guy who can be quite clingy sometimes.

The hardest part of being a math PhD student is losing motivation.

When I started my PhD journey, I hoped to eventually secure a place at an academic institution.

However, as time went on, I realized that I’m just an ordinary person. I should have realized this sooner, but I guess I was lying to myself.

It’s not that I can’t finish my PhD—that’s exactly why I’m struggling. I could finish it, but then what? Would my talent be enough to support further academic development? I’ve lost the passion at the beginning.

Another frustrating part of being a math PhD student is the limited career options in industry. I searched online, but the information wasn’t encouraging. If I were in computer science or engineering, at worst, I could simply find a job. But with a math PhD? Jobs like quant roles only prefer people from top schools, and software development requires a computer science background. Even if I finish the PhD, I still might not find a decent job. I have lost the motivation to finish the PhD 

This is what I call a math diploma dilemma: if you quit, you lose almost everything; if you stay, you gain almost nothing."

The first course I'm debating is Aeromech 1 or Basic Mech 1. I'm interested in controls, so I was reccomended aeromech over mech because it gets more into the dynamics. Does that sound about right? The second thing I'm debating is between combined linear + diff or taking them separate. I was initially reccomended to take them separate because that was seen as better for controls, but I just learned that MA 511 (linear algebra with applications) is required for the automated controls specialization for EE. In that case, is it better to take the combined and then 511 or take separate and still take 511."

The cheapest I got was from progressive, if I pay for 6months it comes to 270/month with all the minimum legal limits.

I don't know how many people have been in this situation who can help me out, but I'd appreciate anything

"Veterans day and Purdue, a history",https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1gp0z0u/veterans_day_and_purdue_a_history/,26,10,2024-11-11 19:37:03,"Today is Veterans Day in the U.S. it is also Armistice Day or Remembrance Day if you're from Britain or the Commonwealth. 

To be clear it is Veterans, with no apostrophe because it's in honor of them not belonging to them. In the same way that it's Groundhog Day not Groundhog's Day.

Veterans Day is always the 11th of November because that was the day that World War one ended in 1918.

You may see some students wearing poppy flowers which tells you that those students are either foreign or confused. 

Poppy flowers are in reference to ""In Flanders Fields"" a beautiful and haunting poem describing fields of poppy flowers growing between soldier's graves. It was written by Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae a Canadian doctor and soldier who died near the end of the war.

Poppy flowers are used to honor the dead. Which is why they are worn on Remembrance Day and Memorial Day. 

Memorial Day is in May and honors those who died in service to the country while Veterans Day honors all those who served and are currently serving.

Canadian Remembrance Day honors all veterans both alive and dead but still includes the practice of wearing poppy flowers.

Where does Purdue sit in all of this? 

The first president of Purdue Richard Owen, namesake of Owen Hall, was a veteran. 


Owen was Indiana's first state geologist, but today's story begins in earnest in 1861 at the start of the American Civil War. 

Owen joined up with the 15th Indiana Infantry and was promoted to colonel of the 60th Indiana Infantry.

While stationed at camp Morton in Indianapolis he was put in charge of 4,000 Confederate prisoners.

His strict but humane treatment of the prisoners was well-regarded. He allowed the Confederate sergeants to largely self-govern and allowed the prisoners to form glee clubs, theater groups, sports teams, and run an on-site bakery.

However, he also ran a tight ship and had a low level of escaped prisoners compared to the average at the time.

His regiment returned to active service, and when he was captured, Confederate General Simon Buckner personally thanked him for the kind treatment of prisoners and allowed him to keep his sidearm as a show of respect. 

After his release he served in several more battles before retiring and becoming first a teacher at I.U. and then the first president of Purdue (although he resigned before the first semester with students due to differences with the trustees).

A second notable veteran of Purdue was Dorothy Stratton. (Not to be confused with Canadian actress Dorothy Stratten).

After earning her PhD from Columbia she became Purdue’s first full-time Dean of Women and during her time nearly tripled the enrollment of women at the college. She also oversaw the construction of 3 women's dorms and several notable women's programs.

In 1942 to joined the Women's Naval Reserve saying she was willing ""to do whatever I could to serve my country.""

After FDR created a Women's reserve branch for the coast guard Stratton became the first member of the new program.

She was promoted to liutenant commander making her the first woman to be commissioned as an officer in the coast guard. By 1944 she was promoted to captain and the program was renamed SPARS after the coast guard motto.

Under her watch more than 10,000 women were enlisted in SPARS and more than 1,000 women joined her as commissioned officers.

This included Helen B. Schleman, namesake of Schleman Hall and lifelong friend of Stratton, who also obtained the rank of captain and after returning from service would serve as Purdue’s next non-interim Dean of Women. 

When Stratton retired in 1946 the u.s. coast guard had the highest percentage of women of any u.s. military branch.

After she retired she went on to be the first director of personnel for the International Monetary Fund, and serve on the executive board for the Girl Scouts for a decade.

Stratton and Schleman shared a house in West Lafayette until Schleman's death in 1992.

Stratton would pass in 2006 at the age of 107.

These are but a few of Purdue's many veterans. 

Whether you plan to serve, currently are serving, or have served in the past, both here in the states or abroad, thank you.

It is suggested that you give 2 minutes of silence to think of those who have served, whether it be about Owen, Stratton, Schleman, or one of the countless students or staff that have served, please take a moment.

This has been Purdue’s Peter honoring Purdue’s history of service."

Why is it every year at least 2 DJ's play ""Losing it?"" You guys are aware there has been a massive amount of music released since 2015 right? Do y'all just-not listen to new music??

The thing is, I would make my own club and throw my own raves but finding people who like any song past 2015 is hard to come by. It is always people who say ""Oh yeah I listen to edm"" and then you play them something mainstream from the present day and they're like ""Oh no that's too much/that's too weird/Not like that"". Then you ask them what edm they listen to and they pull up songs that were in the 2013 Tomorrowland setlist ughhh Ok mr I'm different bc I listen to deadmau5.

I'm sick and tired of it :) If you are a DJ go to Spotify first and listen to new songs, I promise it's OK to get out of your comfort zone. 

Also fyi, good setlists program DJ's according to their overall bpm mix. So you place the 110-120 bpm DJ first, the 130-140 next, and the 140-150 last. That's how you ""build up"" the energy through the night. There's only so many times you can build up and do a drop at 120 bpm throughout the night before people stop getting turnt up every time."

Acoustical Engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1gnuvdj/acoustical_engineering/,4,1,2024-11-10 06:55:13,"Hello Purdue Hive Mind.

I plan on transferring to Purdue’s West Lafayette Campus to pursue an Acoustical Engineering Degree (Vibrational). However, I would like to ask some Questions to anyone here who has graduated from this Program or is currently in this program. 

My biggest question is: Is this section of Engineering too niché? My other plans are either Mechanical or Electrical Engineering. Would it be smarter to pursue a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering/Electrical Engineering with a focus in Acoustics? 

Also, what classed are available that teach about the Physics of Sound? Would adding a Physics Major on top of Acoustics work? This seems a bit overkill, IMO, but I’ll do what I must. 

What other resources are out there for finding out what you can do with an Acoustical Engineering Degree? 

A little bit about me:

I currently have a Bachelor’s of Science in Music Business from Elmhurst University. After I graduated in 2019, I have found success in the product side of the Music Industry, having worked for different Music Retail Stores and Musical Instrument Manufacturers both in sales, customer service, international shipping, and product design. However, this industry (Music Products) was hit very hard by COVID-19. The industry is slowly recovering, but not fast enough to keep up with the rising cost of living. The money is also very stagnant. I’ve been with my current job for almost four years now and my hourly rate has increased from $19.25 to $22.07 (approx 12.8% increase). Ideally, I would like to work in the more “sciency” part of the Music Industry, but I’m also open to working with Sonar Technology or Hearing Technology, like Noise Cancelling Headphones and Hearing aids. 

I know this is a very long post, but any help is appreciated. 

Thank you in advance. "

Ethics and Philosophy in Anime Club? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1gnuyb8/ethics_and_philosophy_in_anime_club/,1,7,2024-11-10 07:00:52,"I've been pretty interested in existential philosophy and moral questions the past few years in high school. I've also watched anime ever since COVID started and it stuck with me with the freedom of different worlds and narratives it gives. As an FYE Engineer, I don't want to be the guy who just knows how to write lines of code and solve math equations. That's cool but I want to explore this world through another lens! 

Here's my observation:

I've noticed that animes like Monster (dealing with a neurosurgeon's moral dilemma of choosing to save a child on the verge of death who has committed murder), Psycho-pass (SPOILER ALERT: the possibility of an entire law system based on a super-computer of brains deciding morally correct actions) or even a popular one like Attack of Titan (the idea of the end justifies the means therefore a discussion of modern-day Machiavellians and discussion of freedom in context of human life). These animes and more offer an interesting narrative/take on morally ambiguous themes and help one get closer to answering some complex questions or rather find space to consider thinking about them.

**I personally believe a club that involves a discussion-based space where people passionate about these 'morally challenging topics' can come and talk about it from their favourite anime/manga. Doesn't have to be limited to animes but possibly even other art forms! We kind of explore philosophy through anime and essentially hold socratic dialogue therefore fostering a clash of ideas and thinking.**

Some other ideas to further this club is exploring a study abroad option in Japan or even help philosophy enthusiasts or simply interested students to consider studying philosophy. 

As a freshman, I'm pretty sure there will be hardly any reception to this idea but I do believe if people are interested, we can make this happen! So for those people who like a good debate, for those people who want to share their ideas and passion for their favourite animes or even those who just like exploring some tough questions, this might be the opportunity to do so! 

Would love to hear you opinion on this! Honest feedback always appreciated :)

I thought I solved this problem by creating Veygo, a car rental service exclusively for Purdue Students.

However, I realized that my prices were way too high for students that just want to buy groceries or run some errands. This left no good alternative if you just need a car to drive around town.

Zipcar has terrible customer service, and their cars are dirty and poorly maintained while Turo and big car rental companies will charge you an arm and a leg.

This is why I decided to fight back and do things differently with Veygo:

* We have no young age or hidden fees
* We deliver cars right to your doorstep
* We are open 24/7
* We offer full coverage insurance
* Our weekday price starts at just $34.99 a day

With this option you can now get groceries, run errands, or make 20 trips to a certain location in EE (don’t worry I won’t judge), all to your heart’s content.

If you want to try out the future of student car rentals go to [rentveygo.com](http://rentveygo.com), or text us at ‪(765) 273-3727 if you have any questions.

I know I'm not alone but I feel like everybody else is getting this stuff way easier than I am. Going to lecture hasn't helped at all either. I tried to understand the professor, but nothing the professor says gets into my head. For this reason, I've been watching Rick's recorded lectures for 270, but my brain just stopped working on the sequential logic module. I got an A on the first exam, scored a standard deviation lower than the average on the second, and feel completely helpless on the third exam on sequential logic coming up in a few days. I have an A average right now on the labs, but only because I literally spend hours working on each lab, but the lab practical coming up in a few weeks I feel completely helpless since it'll be timed and I won't be getting any help from the TAs. I've accepted that I'll have to retake this class next semester, which I know sounds ridiculous, but I'm probably going to end up failing the third exam coming up and the lab practical. I still try my best regardless, and I take my academics extremely seriously.

However, I am still not getting my result for application. I need the result atleast before December starts because of my Visa Problem (I need to submit my F-1 Visa application asap).

I called admissions for this issue, but they told me they even have no clue on when the application is going to be processed. Is there anyone who's having same trouble as I am going through?

Also, Is it fine to apply for housing on spring 2023 even my results didn't come out? This is also the problem since the housing application ends Dec 1 as I remember.

I’m struggling with setting up bounds for integrals that involve Jacobian transformations. I can calculate the Jacobian determinant easily enough, but figuring out the bounds for the new region after a transformation always trips me up.

For example, if I’m given a region in the xy-plane and I apply a transformation like:

u=f(x,y),v=g(x,y)

I know how to find the expressions for x and y in terms of u and v, but I get lost when it comes to translating the original bounds for x and y into bounds for u and v.

Any tips, tricks, or systematic approaches you use to figure out these bounds? Step-by-step examples or common pitfalls to avoid would be especially helpful!

Mackey Arena is historically one of the most electric experiences in all of college basketball. And yet it was unremarkable last night, ***at a game where we unveiled our Final Four banner***. I know, it's a 6pm Monday game against a little-known school. BUT that shouldn't matter here, and it certainly didn't in prior years.

I sat upper bowl last night and there were a TON of open seats in the student section. It was equally bad at the exhibition game last week. Most students around me that did come were (1) disengaged, (2) on their phones, (3) constantly sitting down and (4) not participating in the Mackey chants. The actual Paint Crew in the lower bowl was also lower energy than usual, with significantly weaker chants and people sitting down on their phones during stoppages of play.

It's early, and there's plenty of season to improve. BUT KNOW that if you come to Mackey Arena it is your ***BOILERMAKER DUTY*** to get the place ROCKING to support our guys out there! Get loud, yell OHHHHHHH on defense and do the chants on offense. Clap it up and scream and shout and for the love of Purdue Pete KEEP STANDING during timeouts!

Clarification on selecting time/professor preferences on Course Request Form,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1gk7ts8/clarification_on_selecting_timeprofessor/,38,1,2024-11-05 14:22:47,"Advisor here. I just wanted to demystify any confusion about whether selecting preferences will make it harder to get into a specific class.

Selecting a preference for a specific time or professor will NOT impact your ability to get into a class. I've reached out to the person in the registrar's office who handles preregistration, and she confirmed that preferences are just preferences. If a preferred time in a certain section isn't possible, then Unitime will try all the other sections. Preferencing allows students to tell Unitime which section they'd prefer, but getting into the course is most important.

This is outlined on page 9 of the [Unitime Manual](https://www.purdue.edu/registrar/documents/faculty/advisors/UniTime_Course_Request_User_Manual.pdf) as well.

Thank you /u/Ok-Store-2788 for bringing this to my attention. I think many advisors and students never had a clear answer to this. I originally thought preferences were just preferences, only to be told otherwise. Even the [Pre-Registration FAQ page](https://www.purdue.edu/registrar/faculty/advisors/Student%20Pre-Registration%20FAQs.html) makes it sound like Unitime will not attempt to place you into a different section.

**TL;DR: It's okay to select specific time/professor preferences on your course request form during pre-registration.**"

I’ve talked to, no joke, 500 people—yes, FIVE HUNDRED HUMAN BEINGS—and I don't think a single soul, not a single breathing entity in all of Indiana, wants my lease at Lark DURING A HOUSING CRISIS. Is this a JOKE? Is this some sick cosmic prank? Am I cursed? Did I anger the John Lark in the heavens somehow? I’m trapped, shackled to this lease like a prisoner, forever bound to Lark, where I’ll probably haunt the halls even after graduation.

Every. Single. Day. I try to pawn this thing off. I post, I DM, I BEG. I’ve become some kind of gremlin, lurking everywhere, popping out to harass poor souls with my “Hey, looking for a lease?” like a broken record on loop. My friends avoid me. My family doesn’t call. I haven't eaten in 3 days. I’m slowly losing all sense of reality—because somehow, NO ONE wants this place. How can 500 people turn me down IN THIS ECONOMY? How is it possible that every time I think I’m close, they just vanish? Just…POOF! Gone, like I imagined them. Was I hallucinating?

Now every stranger I pass on the street, I wonder: could it be them? Are they the one to free me from this curse. But no, of course not. I’m at the end of my tether. I’m spiraling into madness. I’ve started dreaming about this lease—nightmares where I’m running through unending hallways, desperately trying to hand off this, frankly, amazing deal (575 I can go lower btw) to ANYONE, but everyone just laughs and fades away.

I am applying for Fall 2025, for an MS in Computer Science (CS). I am interested in robotics, computer vision, and AI. 

I am researching courses to mention in my SOP and for a general idea for my plan of study. In the course catalog ([link](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/academic-programs/courses/index.html)) many courses I like for example Robot Manipulation ([CS 59200-RM1](https://selfservice.mypurdue.purdue.edu/prod/bzwsrch.p_catalog_detail?term=202510&subject=CS&cnbr=59200&enhanced=Y)) and Reinforcement Learning ([CS 59200-RLI](https://selfservice.mypurdue.purdue.edu/prod/bzwsrch.p_catalog_detail?term=202510&subject=CS&cnbr=59200&enhanced=Y)) are available.   
However, the areas table ([link](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/curriculum/masters.html#AreasTable)) focuses on courses other than these, and since I plan a thesis, I am limited to selecting one course from these.

I wanted to know if I can select CS courses not directly mentioned in the areas table, to focus my MS on AI and Robotics. And also if you could share any experience with these courses that would be great!"

As most of you are already certainly already aware, I am an avid jaywalker around campus. I need to get around campus often, and sometimes that includes just not giving a crap about anyone else who is in my way. Oftentimes I get honked at for walking out in front of a moving car cuz they think that they own the road. Well guess what? It's state law to yield to pedestrians regardless of whether or not there's a crosswalk. And if you hit me, that's gonna be a nice insurance payout for my college tuition. 

The only inconvenience I have with jaywalking is that most people just don't understand that I am the law. And sometimes, that hurts my feelings. I just wanna walk around campus without looking both ways at a crosswalk and just not have to deal with the potential consequences of doing that. My previous alma mater, SigmaUniversityOnline, had a subscription service where you could simply pay a few dollars monthly to not have ads when viewing their content, and I feel like Purdue should have something like that for Jaywalking. 

I looked around the Purdue website, and didn't find anything that slightly resembled. So if you could, please link me to where I can buy jaywalk premium or whatever they it call it at Purdue because not having it is seriously affecting my grindset.

Thanks,

\-- Your local sigma alpha chad"

My understanding of STAT 417 is that it's a rigorous course that looks at the math underlying statistical concepts. STAT 517 should be more difficult / cover more, since it's the grad version, but all the resources I have seen say that it's an intro to statistical inference class.

I’m currently studying at a community college and hoping to transfer to Purdue to pursue engineering. I’m most interested in nuclear and aerospace engineering, but my parents think chemical engineering might offer broader job options, it’s hard to decide.

Since I’ll be transferring, I probably won’t have time to do a double major or minor, so I’ll have to pick one. I know Purdue has strong programs in each of these areas, and I’d really appreciate insight into each program, especially academic experience, career opportunities, future trends, and also if any of these programs have specific advantages or resources at Purdue.

Thank you!!"

Personally I come from a place where the cops do absolutely nothing. So I mean yea that was an overreaction to a homeless guy acting crazy but like in my hometown, if your car gets stolen, the cops will tell you that it that maybe you should be more prepared.

1. If the bathroom has no ventilation, you should regularly check for mold. If there is mold growing in the shower, submit a fix-it to regrout
2. If the electricity is shorting out, check to see  if your appliances are overloading the circuit. If not, file a fix it and specifically ask them to check the power sockets. ours were cheap and a fire hazard, and were constantly shorting the power. 
3. If the water is super rusty, get a brita and filter it 2 or 3 times, with some jugs to pour the filtered water back into the brita. If the water smells or tastes like chlorine very strongly for more than a week, file a fix it and ask for the water to be tested. A faint odor is normal and ok but a strong chemical taste is not safe to drink. 
4. If the AC unit is not working, try to take out the lint filter and clean it. If it’s still broken, it may be too powerful for the electric circuit and you may need a new one. the university should cover it. 
5. check the knobs on the heaters to see if they are stuck, you might need to replace them or loosen them so you can adjust the heater. 
6. If there are bugs, it’s the gap in the window under the AC unit. Never leave dirty dishes or food uncovered (u shouldn’t b doing that anyways) and put some peppermint oil on a napkin on the windowsill to ward off bugs. 
7. check the ceilings for water stains and take pictures of any stains. If you notice them getting bigger, the roof is leaking. 

Always document issues with water or electricity! Most of these problems you can fix yourself and aren’t too bad but you should always have water and electricity. It’s not maintenance’s fault the university is cheap but you should still have those issues resolved in less than a week (and not the 2 months we spent with no clean water). 

Edit: I understand that not everyone who lives in Hilltop has this experience. Some buildings are newer and nicer than others. However, it’s still worth giving a fair warning to people who might end up being assigned the older and nastier buildings so they have an opportunity to find better housing if it’s possible. "

They also said that they would report to the department and OSSR.

i plan on confessing, I was just wondering whether the infraction would stay on my transcript and if my parents would be notified. In addition, if anyone has been in this situation, would they actually lower the penalty?

  
im losing my mind rn because of this as I struggle with mental health and family problems and i genuinely think this may be the end for me. Any response on how to deal w this and information is greatly appreciated.

In terms of the actual rent cost per month I see its generally quite similar, but what I'm looking to know (if anyone lives/has lived in these places feedback would be great) is the total cost of living when other costs, namely **utilities** come in to play. I know Hub is by the month and Verve is by the quarter, not sure about the others.

So if I withdraw from CS240, I might be unable to maintain my F1 status anymore.

 I'm currently a freshman and wasn't really planning on living in an apartment this soon, and honestly, I don't really know what to do.

My family lives about 2.5 hours away so commuting from home to school isn't really an option for me unless I transfer or something, which I have been considering but I don't really see that working any better.

The reason is that I am currently working with a professor in other department, and it seems that I can only transfer to thesis track with supervision by ECE professor, and compared with course-only track, project track has larger workload.

(b) If anybody had to stay over the summer, for example a full summer term, what would they do, since the lease doesn't cover that period?

  
(c) Which insurance did you take / do you know that is good for international students?

It could lead to a new friendship, professional contact or even date.

Basically, you sign up, specify your interests and hobbies and define filters for what you are looking for (just like a dating app). However, you won't need to swipe or get swiped at. Once a week, the app pairs participants together based on their interests. Participants can either accept or reject the pairing. And the app will not be exclusively for dating. Based on your interests, you can get paired with other students just looking for a friend or looking to chat about specific topics (politics, tech, AI, etc).

Would you be interested in joining (even if it requires a cheap monthly fee)?

=================================================================

I feel there's limited opportunities for introverted students (like myself) to find new friends or go on dates.

And I believe a platform like this will be more trustworthy if it is tailored specifically for individual college campuses (you know, just like how facebook started).

For those that have interned at Google, this idea is similar to lunch ninja where you get paired with a random Googler every week for lunch.

This is just an idea I've been thinking about recently but unfortunately, being a graduate student doesn't leave me with enough extra time to pursue it on my own.

What do you guys think of this idea? Would you subscribe if it were available? Or do you think there are other startups already doing something similar?

That 2k1 exam , which I studied well over 40 hours for, was absolutely nothing testing what I learned in the class (except the FRQ’s), everything was just tricks, and even if you did the problem right , there are 8 options and the right answer wouldn’t even be there so you doubt yourself?!? That’s not testing if you know how to do it..

The whole situation is just highway robbery, the fact that apartments can jack up their rent on the same units depending how many leases they have left is insane. How can a lease differ by 100$ a month, if someone signs a week later than another. Not to mention if you don't life in a huge apartment you're forced to live in a tiny studio where you are still paying >950$ a month. I do not know how people can afford this. It has gotten to the point where if I don't get on campus housing I will have to transfer.

1. Is it normal/customary to have to fill out a form including your ssn and pay stubs and pay a fee of $75 to to just be able to view a place, I'm asking because supposedly each of us are being forced to pay and fill out a rental application to visit the place.

2. Is the lease set in stone 12 months or can we do a 10 month lease to exclude summer?

3. The renting application requires two pay stubs, how can we provide these if we are unemployed?

4. How long does it take after we fill out a renting application for us to be able to sign a full contract for next year.

5. Is there any room to lower the rent or is haggling not a thing in this situation."
