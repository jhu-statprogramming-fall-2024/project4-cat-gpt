Without giving it much thought, I figured sure I’ll fill it out quickly since I was focused on preparing for an exam and keep things pushing. However, as I looked through the survey (slowly since that Celsius wasn't kicking like it was 2 hours ago), I noticed irregular and inconsistent font including the use of a ZERO instead of a capital O. I double-checked the email address, and it seemed to be from an official UMD admin account. I was just fr tired, didn't submit anything, and realized this could fr get someone. So I just decided to hop on Reddit to potentially save someone or have someone realize damn I filled out that form and take action.  Either way I'll figure this out in newsletter in the morning (realistically 2pm). Im just wondering how they got my man's Mike so quickly.

**TL;DR:** Pretty sure an admin account got hacked and is sending out emails to get access to more accounts.

**Edit:** I realized I may have slightly fudged up the title. I did not get hacked, I was just tired and was essentially on autopilot during the duration in which I saw the email to posting the thread.  I should’ve titled it **Possible hacked UMD Admin email**.

The fee increase funds increases in DOTS operational costs. This story has been updated.*

The University of Maryland DOTS increased its shuttle bus student fee by about 16 percent from last academic year to this year.

The increase is partially due to this university’s investments in electric buses, according to Lexie Leong, the Residence Hall Association’s student fees coordinator.

While other mandatory student fees increased slightly, the shuttle bus fee saw the biggest jump from last academic year to this year, Leong, a sophomore computer science major, said in a presentation at a Nov. 11 RHA meeting.

Full-time students were charged $861 in mandatory fees for the fall semester, with the shuttle bus fee accounting for $155.50 of this total. Students will be charged the same amount for the spring semester.

We have researched many and toured a few apartments (landmark, alloy, UView, etc.), but they all seem to charge a monthly rent of about $2k a person (which we definitely can't afford).

We were hoping we could just have one bed and pay $2k total since most apartments say that rent is per bed... but none were truly like that.

I'm just wondering if there are any nearby apartments or other off-campus housing options which are closer to $1k a person per month or $2k total?

I am already so behind and I struggle so badly in math, I just feel worried that I won’t end up passing it next semester and i’ll just be held behind even more. It’s to the point where I am considering changing my major :/ I was going to also take Math 115 at PGCC because the classes are quite small in my experience which was helpful for me but I found out that it is not allowed to take that course outside of UMD. I also took Stats at PGCC and got an A and i’m also stressed that maybe even that class won’t be accepted.

***Research lead***                                                                                                                                     

As part of the STMD directorate I focused my research on projects ranging from hypersonic research to deep space propulsion to experimental robotic concepts. Some of them include:  


·         VOS – The Venus Observatory satellite

·         DSE – Deep space exploration satellite 

·         MSL/EV - Mars surface landing / exploration vehicle 

·         Experimental robotic research (a broad term for research into specific technologies part of the STMD) - Some of the concepts include the Mars ROV concept, the Venus mechanical sensor system (concept), the star shade project that also acts as a light sail to conserve propellant, the Lunar soft robotics program and other concepts that may be relevant to future mission concepts and projects

·         AREE automaton mechanical sensing project - 

·         NASA robotic assembly research program

I haven't taken any of these but I want to apply to Smith by the end of spring because I'll have 45 credits. I was wondering how I should go about taking these classes, I'm registered for BSTAT over the winter and planning to take Accounting and Calc in one semester + 3 easy gen eds. Is that too much workload for one semester in spring and is BSTAT too difficult to compress into 3 weeks? I need to make sure I maintain a 3.6 with this workload as well of course. I was wondering should I take accounting at a community college and bstat in the spring, should I wait to apply for Smith next year in the fall or keep it the way it is or how should I go about knocking out these gateways with good grades? Any Smith acceptees or Smith graduate students who have taken these courses have any course of action that is recommended?"

Let’s all go to Bentley’s Forever - a Tribute to John Brown ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1gsjf1e/lets_all_go_to_bentleys_forever_a_tribute_to_john/,209,2,2024-11-16 09:00:53,"I’m not sure how this will be received on this subreddit, especially with a lot of younger students posting and concerned with classes, exams, schedules, and the effect of Covid on what student life is like. All valid things and my heart goes out to all of you for what you are going through individually and as a whole. 

I just wanted to take a moment and make a post to let you all know what a wonderful and compassionate man John Brown was and how his passing will be a loss for the University of Maryland and our community as a whole.

For those of you that do not know, John Brown was the owner of RJ Bentley’s, our well known college bar that has been a staple for over 45 years. He passed this last weekend at 77 years old. 

SVP made a great speech in his last podcast and there was a moment before the game, and I know that people that follow MD basketball have seen or listened to these- but there are some things the general public may not know.

During COVID, John arranged for the Bentleys kitchen to make sandwiches for Meals on Wheels every week because he saw it as the right thing to do. He continued this even after COVID was “over”, all through his own donation, they are still continuing it to this day. He donated to UMD as an alumni and proprietor, and cared deeply about the university and all our success.

I am a UMD alumni and knew John personally, he was a generous, kind, brilliant man. We have all taken a loss as a community and I hope his legacy lives on. 

SVP said it himself in the podcast, 

“I would ask John if he could do me a favor and John would say—“

“The answer is yes, just ask me the question”

Let’s all go to Bentley’s forever "

Franklin was sentenced on Wednesday to five years in prison, with four years suspended, according to a news release from the Maryland state prosecutor’s office. Franklin was also sentenced to three years of supervised probation and ordered to pay more than $133,000 in restitution.

The former council member signed a guilty plea on Aug. 26 to perjury and felony theft scheme.

Franklin resigned from the council on June 14, less than a week before he was charged in the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court with embezzlement, perjury and theft scheme related to his mishandling of campaign funds.

“We hope that this dissuades others who may seek to use their official position for personal gain or to interfere with the integrity of Maryland elections,” state prosecutor Charlton Howard III, said in the news release.

The FBI is currently investigating the source. Whichever organization sent the texts is well-equipped and organized, as the source is well-hidden and has yet to be determined. The only information so far is that the texts originated from outside the United States.

Most likely, the texts were sent by a foreign agent (Russia, China) trying to sow division among the American people.

Kenneth Gray, a University of New Haven lecturer and retired FBI special agent, [emphasized the advanced capability of the attackers](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/us/racist-text-messages-post-election/index.html). ""They did some real research not only putting together their target list but also crafting a message that had \[personal\] information that made it seem real.""

""We have seen that there was an uptick, especially in the election, with Russian agents ... and troll farms in Russia, attempting to influence and put out a lot of misinformation and disinformation.""

What actually stands out is solving real problems or bringing new ideas to the table. Here's the thing: we all have those shower thoughts – ideas we think could solve problems but never pursue because we're afraid they sound stupid. But maybe they're not stupid at all? We'll never know unless we discuss them.

The beauty of being at UMD is our diverse perspectives – from CS to Psychology and everything in between. One person might not know everything, but they might know someone who knows someone who knows something. That's powerful.

* Have ideas but aren't sure how to implement them
* Are tired of keeping their ""stupid"" ideas to themselves
* Want to meet weekly for an hour to brainstorm and collaborate

If I contributed to a Donald Trump victory, I would feel some responsibility for the dangerously racist rhetoric he ignites and his unpredictable, borderline authoritarian nature. If I contributed to a Kamala Harris victory, there is a guarantee of my number one concern remaining, and possibly being amplified: the United States backed and funded genocide in Gaza.

I’ve juggled all possible thoughts in my mind. Is the comfort of my rights worth the sacrifice of one “issue” that violates the inalienable rights of others?

The answer is always a no. Nothing in my mind warrants cheering on a candidate who vows to protect “military objectives” for a country incontestably committing international war crimes. At the same time, turning towards a convicted felon who shamelessly harbors a plethora of -phobias and -isms to bear a solution for peace is laughable.

When I returned to campus after voting, I wasted no time in reconvening with people who share the same sentiments as me, whether it’s our stances on police and gun violence, women’s rights or our university’s deadly military industrial complex. Together we converse, we grieve and we organize.

I was telling myself this and maybe if you’re on UMD Reddit right now you need someone to tell you this too.

You are doing well. You have been doing well. You will continue to do well. It doesn’t matter what your major is, and how many C’s and below you’ve gotten up to this point. You are still here.

Whenever you or someone else plants a seed of doubt in you that you are doing a horrible job, remember that countless people couldn’t make it to this point, and you aren’t one of them. It doesn’t matter if you aren’t on the Dean’s list, because when you walk the the stage in a future Spring, you and that straight A student will both have a degree saying you made it through. 

So if you have an exam, homework assignment, project, etc. coming up, don’t psych yourself out. Get out of bed, wash your face, and start working because if you failed being scared you’ll always wonder if you could’ve passed by being braver.

Good luck, we have a month left, and I believe in you."

\-------------

Context: As per Maryland state law, UMD is not required to recognize our union and collectively bargain with us. While grad workers have fought this battle in the MD state legislature yearly, UMD continues to spend money and time testifying to ensure the law remains unchanged. Luckily, the legislative route is not the only way to have UMD meet us at the bargaining table -- UMD can choose to voluntarily recognize our union, which would allow us to bypass the legislature entirely. Several universities voluntarily recognized their own grad workers' unions, including Georgetown, NYU, and University of Michigan. A supermajority of UMD grad workers have signed union authorization cards. It's time for UMD to recognize us and meet us at the bargaining table!

Educators, researchers, parents and students for decades have argued that standardized testing, specifically in college admissions, is not an accurate measure of student potential and is often influenced by factors beyond academic knowledge.

In 2020, these arguments were thrust into national attention after more than [1,600](https://fairtest.org/test-optional-list/) colleges and universities went test-optional for the 2020-21 application season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to FairTest.

I work full time so will need to be enrolled as a part time student, taking two classes per semester, and I will need to make arrangements in order to be off of work during class time.

More than 400 students packed into Stamp Student Union’s Colony Ballroom on Wednesday for the Student Government Association’s general body meeting. Legislators listened to an hour of student testimony about the resolution before evaluating whether to uphold or overturn an unfavorable committee report in a closed-session discussion.

The SGA’s civic engagement and governmental affairs committee [voted against](https://dbknews.com/2024/11/06/umd-sga-committee-unfavorable-divestment/) the divestment resolution on Monday. On Wednesday, the SGA’s general body voted 19-17-2 to uphold the committee’s unfavorable report, which prevented the resolution from reaching a final vote.

If the resolution reached a final vote and passed, the SGA would have begun lobbying this university, the UMCP foundation, the University System of Maryland and the university system foundation to divest from companies “engaged in human rights violations” in places including Palestine, Guatemala and Myanmar. The resolution specified defense companies such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.

Help…,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1gljyrf/help/,28,13,2024-11-07 06:09:28,I recently dropped CHEM 131 with Friedman after failing my second midterm (didn’t get the material even after going to GSS and office hours) and now I feel horrible cause I’m at 11 credits instead of 14. It feels like I’m gonna be set back so badly and I really wanted to look good on paper but now I’m not sure I’m gonna get any sort of job in the future. This school is academically tough and there’s so many people who have it all figured out except for me. Not to mention I’ve been dealing with a lot of stress lately with personal issues with my family and mental health stuff that set me back. I might have ADHD but I can’t even afford screening. I feel like I’m screaming into a void here and there’s no set solution for my specific problem.

Best/Common Time to Study Abroad as a Pre-Med?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1gjs24z/bestcommon_time_to_study_abroad_as_a_premed/,4,1,2024-11-04 23:04:23,"I applied EA and I have had a 5 year wish (soon to be goal) of studying abroad in South Korea.

I started self studying the language in middle school.

I am still not completely sure of the requirements, and am aware that they are dependent on the school.

I have read that it is best to study abroad during junior year.

I am planning to be pre-med though, and understand that many prerequisites should be done in the country, so I'll have to keep that in mind.

I would also have to see about financial aid.

Again take this with a grain of salt because I didn’t see the incident happen, but some guy nearby claimed she was making out with a guy outside the restaurant. (I’m assuming they were both pretty drunk) she slipped and fell near the curb and cracked her head open pretty bad.

Professor isn’t letting me make up work despite having medical documentation ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1giwk7d/professor_isnt_letting_me_make_up_work_despite/,64,81,2024-11-03 20:35:40,"COMM107 is supposed to be my easiest class as I am a Letters and Science Student trying to get into the Clarke School of Engineering. I was excelling in all of my classes this semester until I got extremely ill during the month of october. I have had repeated episodes of passing out, constant vertigo, nausea, etc. I have gone to the hospital twice and have had many doctor appointments because of it. This caused me to decline in all of my classes, especially my more rigorous classes such as MATH246 and PHYS260. I have all of my LEP gateway courses out of the way and I brought my GPA up over the summer from a 2.3 to a 3.2 from retaking calc2 and getting an A+ as well as taking PHYS161 and getting a B. The reason I did not apply for fall admission to the Clarke school was because I had a concussion during the time of applications from a work incident and was unable to look at screens. I thought maybe if I continue to perform very well in all of my classes, I should be able to apply for engineering in the spring. 

After getting sick, all of my grades plummeted aside from a few gen eds. I have provided documentation to all of my professors, and most of them were super understanding and accommodating aside from my communications professor. I met with her during her office hours about two weeks ago because I was feeling better that day and I didn't want to add any more make-up work to my plate as I already have. With vertigo, it has been a struggle to come to class since I am a commuter and driving to campus is extremely dangerous based on my circumstances. After meeting with her during her office hours, she seemed accommodating however she did try and push getting an incomplete in her class. I did not want to take an incomplete in her class especially since I had an A at the time and I only had to make up a few participation points. The next week, on wednesday I had a presentation that I had fully prepared for, however, I passed out that same morning and stayed home. I was advised by my uncle who is a doctor after checking my blood pressure after I had passed to not go to the ER since my blood pressure wasn't considered low enough to be of concern. Instead he advised me to make an appointment with my PCP and get a consult for a head CT. The nearest appointment I could find was for that following Friday and my PCP did end up giving me the consult. 

The next week, which was this past week, I finally had the energy to email my communications professor in which she advised me to come and discuss all this during her office hours. I went to her office hours this past wednesday and explained everything that I had just mentioned and showed her all the documentation from my doctor's appointments and a picture of the consult for the head CT that was signed on that Friday since I had forgotten the doctor's appointment note. She then proceeded to really try and push an incomplete although the only thing I had to do for her class was to make up the presentation. All of the work for the presentation had already been finished, the only thing I needed to do was actually present my information. She then told me that my two options would be to either take an incomplete or to come to every single lecture from here on out even if I have medical issues to barely pass with a C  as she would not let me make up the presentation. 

After trying to reason with her, I told her that I had the entirety of the presentation complete and the only thing I needed to do is actually perform the presentation and if it would be possible to just make up the presentation and continue with the class, she finally agreed to letting me present but only on one condition; I would still have to attend every single lecture even if I have medical issues until the end of the semester and only then she would grade it. I ended up presenting my presentation on Friday (two days ago). She did mention that from here on out, the course is primarily just group work and in order to do well on the rest of the assignments, I will have to be present to help my team. I completely understand her take on this, however I don't really understand the correlation of the previous solo presentation not being graded based off of my future participation, considering the fact that I have done everything I need to for her class and have provided sufficient documentation. 

Another reason why I am against taking the incomplete in any of my classes like physics2 or diffeq is because I am registered for 14 credits full time status. I receive tuition remission benefits through my mom and I simply cannot afford to drop those courses as I would have to pay for tuition.

I don’t know what to do.  "

I understand class registration dates are based by credits, but I feel like if you are on your final semester, then everyone should have the same date. I understand freshman with more credits registering early because they may want to graduate early, but if you are on your LAST? whats the difference between me and someone with 20 more credits.

I am trying to sign up for CMSC424, a database design class where for my focus as backend engineering, is really important for me to take and learn. 

And yet, the only teacher for CMSC424, Herve has a waitlist of 22, and my registration date still isn't for another 3 days. 

Now my only viable options for classes are cybersecurity and ML/AI based courses, which I obviously am not interested in. I do not want to extend my graduation date just so I can get a better chance in applying for courses that I actually want to learn and take.

I thought college was about learning, but with this credit system, for me its more about passing since I can never take classes that I am actually interested in.

Biermann was arrested after the FBI executed a search warrant on his University Park home. He faces 22 charges for possession of child sexual abuse materials and six additional child sexual abuse materials-related charges, according to court documents.

University Park Police were notified about the FBI’s search warrant on Monday morning and were not involved in the search and Biermann’s arrest.

University Park is adjacent to College Park and Hyattsville. Biermann was on the University Park Town Council from June 2020 through June 2022. He later served as the town’s mayor from June 2022 until June 2024. Biermann lost his bid for reelection in May.

This is very much an applied class, not a more traditional programming one, and many of the students don't have a lot of experience in coding. That means it covers some basics and introduces you to some specific tools that developers working in journalism use, like [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) and the excellent SQLite relational database. We'll build websites and notification systems that filter and display interesting data.

So why would, say, non-journalism students on this subreddit take this class? Mainly because we get to work on interesting problems with real-world applications, we spend a fair bit of time talking about how to present data, and there's a chance to get bylines for Capital News Service or contribute to other published work that you could show future employers.

There's a syllabus posted on Testudo and I'm happy to answer questions about the course here or via email ([dpwillis@umd.edu](mailto:dpwillis@umd.edu))."

I gave time for the transcripts and letters of rec to come through, but the checklist layout is really confusing me. it says that I have 2 letters of rec submitted, although I only asked for 1, and the counselor option is left blank, although that may be because it hasn't been delivered yet. Also, under my test scores it is blank, but I applied test optional through CommonApp, but it doesn't make it clear whether it is missing something, or it is left blank because i applied test optional. Finally, under transcripts, it says it received 2 for some reason, but doesn't say ""requirement met."" Overall, I am just really confused by the layout and any help on figuring it out would be great. I attached images of each area of the checklist.

University of Maryland Police announced the latest theft numbers in a campuswide email on Oct. 19. The rise in e-scooter thefts stems from the vehicle’s growing popularity at this university, according to UMPD spokesperson Lt. Rosanne Hoaas.

E-scooters are portable, lightweight and easy to use, which makes them “appealing” for people looking to take advantage of users, Hoaas told The Diamondback.

It's my understanding that this role is something of a cohort that they're hiring within, rather than a typical single job position.

Should I try to negotiate a higher base salary (I was thinking of asking for $105k - $110k)? Or would that be inappropriate here? If you think I should... how?

I (have been in a little bit of a decline right now. Ever since I broke up with my ex, I’ve spent the majority of my time in my room and smoking. The only time I leave is to get water downstairs, grab food, hook up, or hang out with a friend (only at night and drinking); also, I’ve been missing a lot of class. What I’m trying to get at is that I used to eat three meals a day, go to the gym, want to go outside, go to see people, do homework, and aspire for certain goals, but now I don’t want nor feel like doing those things. It wasn’t the context of the breakup, but I think the structure I had with it, and ever since then I've just been doing stupid shit. I want to meet people, but it’s been hard to socialize lately besides being close with friends. I need to socialize, but sometimes I just don't want to hold a conversation.

How To Know If You're Cut Out for the 'Real CS Major' Classes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1gea1wj/how_to_know_if_youre_cut_out_for_the_real_cs/,1,0,2024-10-28 18:56:41,"I genuinely need some advice, so please don’t take this the wrong way. How do you know if you’re ready for classes like 412 or 417? I've heard they’re the toughest in the CS program, and some people say you're not a 'real' CS major if you haven't taken at least one. How did you figure out you were smart enough to handle them? Any tips for someone feeling unsure?

For context, I didn’t breeze through courses like 216 or 330. In fact, I struggled a lot with 330. I’m a slow learner, but once things finally click, they really click. I’m really interested in low-level concepts. Especially networking as in my previous school I learned concepts for Network+ and CCNA, but I’m nervous about whether I can push through the toughest parts of these classes since I learn at a slower pace. This next semester though will be my last and I really want to walk out knowing I gave it my all by taking the courses that truly interest me. For anyone who took 417 before, is there anything I could do before the class starts to ensure I am ready?

Classes taken previously: 414, 420, 451, 430, 335

The other classes I did not include were STICS. I mainly took those and 335 since it made my semester load more manageable along with the other classes mentioned above. I was considering taking an additional cs 4xx class alongside 417 in case I were to find it too difficult and drop but I also don't wanna add an extra class if I don't have to. "

I honestly don't think I'll be able to graduate on time if I don't turn this semester around, but that's not an option. If I can't graduate on time, I'm not sure where I'll go from there because I'll be isolated from my family and will probably end up on the streets. What a waste.

PSA: Halloween Safety Alert 🚨 UMD is Under Attack by Costumed Creatures! 👻,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1gcu8ox/psa_halloween_safety_alert_umd_is_under_attack_by/,58,5,2024-10-26 20:33:21,"Hey Terps,

This is no joke. This Halloween season, I’ve witnessed an unprecedented number of spooky, costumed creatures invading our campus. And they’re not your regular “just here for free candy” trick-or-treaters. They’re something… else.

Here’s what I’ve seen so far:

	1.	A swarm of haunted scooters zooming down McKeldin Mall—ghost riders that stop at nothing, not even stairs. Be on guard, especially if you hear ghostly bells ringing. One tried to hit me with its Razor!
	2.	A pumpkin-headed TA who now shows up to every Econ 201 discussion section. He just stares at us, glowing eyes flickering. Rumor has it he’s here to punish anyone who hasn’t started studying yet for finals. I saw him ask someone a question, and they turned into a PSL.
	3.	“Zombie squirrels” that seem to crave more than just acorns. They’re amassing around the Stamp, and I swear I saw one with a UMD ID around its neck. They’re starting to organize; one came at me with a mini pitchfork fashioned out of a Chick-fil-A straw.
	4.	Helicopters but Halloween style. Now I know we’re used to these choppers on campus, but lately, they’ve been carrying glowing jack-o-lanterns and blaring ominous music. My theory? They’re transporting all the escaped spirits back to Hornbake after their midnight haunt.
	5.	An enormous blob (possibly human? Unconfirmed) wandering around Lot 1. It mostly lurks, but if you approach, it moans something about “midterms and pumpkin pie.” Please avoid if seen. You will get roped into an hour-long conversation.

I’m not saying Halloween is canceled. Just… proceed with caution. And maybe bring a garlic necklace or something? And if you’re dressing up this year, try not to look too much like an actual ghoul—you might get recruited.

Stay safe, and if anyone sees any of this, please update here! We’re all in this together."

It's so stuffy here, smells linger for days and even with the AC and a fan going the air is so stiff and thick. 

I read online that rooms without ventilation are dangerous to sleep in long term, due to heightened CO2 levels. Is there anything I can do about this situation other than just leaving the door open? Thanks"

Student protests give people who care about Palestine hope, Hedges told the crowd during his speech at Stamp Student Union.

From his yearslong experience reporting on Palestine, Hedges said some Palestinians feel like the world has forgotten about them. But that is why student protests supporting Gaza are important, he said.

Chill out.” But it’s so much more than that. I can’t even look at a Veo scooter anymore without feeling… things. Things I probably shouldn’t. Every time I scan that QR code, it’s not just to ride. Oh no. It’s way more intimate than that.



It started with the way it vibrated beneath me—just a slight hum, but enough to awaken something deep inside. Soon I was riding for hours, my legs shaking with anticipation, knees weak as hell, grinding on that cold, hard metal frame like my life depended on it. And don’t even get me started on the way that throttle responds to the lightest touch. Sensitive—like it knows exactly what I need.



Last night, we crossed a line. I found a quiet, secluded space, and things got weird. I can’t explain it, but I just... let go. One hand on the handlebars, the other doing unspeakable things, my body becoming one with the machine. I don’t know how long I was there, but when I finally dismounted, I was drenched—sweat.



The worst part? I’ve started thinking about locking it up for good. The idea of someone else scanning it, touching its controls, riding it like it’s theirs? The thought makes me feel possessive. I want it all to myself, and it’s starting to consume me. I can’t even look at other forms of transportation without feeling sick.



Anyway, anyone know a good therapist? Or are there support groups for people in highly inappropriate scooter relationships? I think I might need help.

Also is this normal?

Please bring your setup and peripherals to the LAN -- Ethernet cables and pizza (🥳) will be provided. We also recommend bringing a power strip as connections to power will be limited.

The LAN schedule is attached and we will also have a Dance Dance Revolution cabinet with tournaments during the day!

We do want to ask that anyone who can act as a carpool driver or who needs to join a carpool please fill out this form ASAP. Carpools are essential to the LAN's success, so please sign up if you have a vehicle. Let's make this a LAN to remember! :D

Chance me for reinstatement? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1gagn7u/chance_me_for_reinstatement/,12,14,2024-10-23 17:43:41,"Hi guys, just like the title says. I am re-appealing my rejection to be reinstated at UMD in order to walk in the Spring. I had an awful family emergency last year leading to a near death of that said family member, along with a (CW) sexual assault that is documented by my therapist. This led to me being academically dismissed at UMD after failing to keep my GPA above or at a 2.0 by the end of Fall 2023. I tried to reapply over the spring in order to take classes this fall, but got rejected.

I essentially took a year off, and have started to take community college classes (\~18 credits) and ending the summer session with a 4.0 and this semester off with a 4.0. I wanted to make note that my first application for reinstatement didn't have any supplemental documentation for my previous situation, but this appeal for Spring 2025 will have a 1. stellar recommendation letter from a professor 2. documentation of hospitalization of that fam. member 3. transcripts from my CC showing that I earned a 4.0. Any advice? Thank you for reading.

edit: I also owe the university money for summer classes I took, around \~3k. is it advised for me to clear that to have a better chance? "

UMD students attend SGA committees in anticipation of divestment resolution,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1gah7wt/umd_students_attend_sga_committees_in/,8,1,2024-10-23 18:06:56,"More than 100 University of Maryland students attended SGA committee meetings on Monday and Tuesday to gain committee voting rights ahead of an anticipated divestment resolution.

The resolution, which could be introduced in a Student Government Association general body meeting as early as next week, will likely be similar to a resolution the general body failed to advance in April. Last spring’s resolution called on the University System of Maryland Foundation to divest from “companies engaged in human rights violations” in places including Palestine, Myanmar and Guatemala.

In April, SGA legislators upheld the student affairs committee’s unfavorable report on the previous resolution. Similar divestment resolutions did not pass in 2017 and 2019.

After an SGA resolution is initially presented at a general body meeting, it is sent to a primary committee, which will vote favorably or unfavorably on the resolution. Undergraduate students must attend at least one meeting of an open committee before they can vote in that committee.

Some students who attended this week’s committee meetings said the anticipated resolution would stand up against human rights violations, while others said it would divide the campus community.

iSchool Expectations/Accountability Rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1g9q4ud/ischool_expectationsaccountability_rant/,52,54,2024-10-22 19:03:23,"TLDR; iSchool does not hold students accountable for actually understanding the material. The classes aren't necessarily 'easy' themselves (difficult enough concepts/assignments/etc.), but they just hand out A's like we are in elementary school. The expectations are nonexistent. People get away with it through the excessive amount of group work and using generative AI, and I wish so badly that projects were solo because they'd just be less work than babysitting a bunch of adults with lackluster performance.

Disclaimer: I am not saying this is ALL iSchool students/professors/classes. This is just a trend I have experienced myself over and over and I am so sick of it.

I am an Information Science major for reference (along with another major & minor in CMNS). I took on the major last year. Going in, I thought it was going to live up to the expectation that everyone gave it: easy enough, full of comp sci dropouts, some projects but not nearly as much outside work as comp sci, etc.

Since being in the major, I have realized its more than just ""easy comp sci."" Not only do the rooms stink just as bad of B.O. as the computer science classes, but many students are incredible slackers/cheaters and the professors rarely hold them accountable. At least in comp sci (I assume) students literally cannot slack off without failing a class (seen it happened to several people freshman year who chose League of Legends over CompSci).

 Scrolling through weekly discussion posts, I see the same conventions being used again and again with the same comments, evident that students are either copying from previous posts or all just using AI like ChatGPT to write their code/discussion post. I am willing to bet that half of these people graduate with an Information Science degree and can't write a program more than 50 lines without the use of generative AI. To clarify, I do think that AI can be very helpful when learning (asking it what certain functions do, to help you remember the name of a function, explain syntax, debugging, etc.), it just shouldn't be used to straight up complete assignments.

The classes themselves are not as ""easy"" as they are made out to be. They're nothing crazy, but they do require some though to understand concepts like objects or keys. But they just don't seem to hold any students accountable for actually doing the work and understanding the material. People are passing these classes having not learned a thing. You can literally finish an ""intro to \[coding language\]"" class and pass with flying colors without knowing a thing about coding in that language.

In my other major, you HAVE to put in the work to get an A. Exam averages range from 50-70 and the grade distribution is a bell curve, with the peak being usually around a B or B-. These classes require you to put in work after class and practice what you learn independently. If you do not study outside of class, do the homework, and actually understand how to apply concepts, you will absolutely fail the class. I assumed that this was the case for all majors. In the iSchool though, I can't imagine anyone getting less than an A- in most of these classes unless they literally didn't do any assignments, simply because the expectation for many classes is less than the bare minimum. 

Many iSchool classes love to assign groupwork. This is a great idea in theory, since many of us will be pursuing careers that require us to work with others, since no one person can realistically write hundreds of thousands of lines of code within a ""normal"" timeframe. However, all these group projects are giving the opportunity for students to slack off further by waiting for the one or two people to do the work for them. I have spoken to several other upperclassmen iSchool majors who feel the same way. Almost every single group project I have been involved in within INST courses have included several underwhelming teammates who do less than the bare minimum. 

For instance, one of my classes required a formal write-up along with the final presentation of our project. I had word-for-word written out everything that my teammate needed to add to the document (I even wrote HER script for the presentation, which she read robotically off of instead of paraphrasing. Did none of these people take a communications class???). All she had to do was format my shorthand bullet points into a short paragraph. Instead, she simply copy and pasted the bullets into a formal essay that specifically asked for paragraph format, leaving me to do that entire section myself.

Also, loads of these classes are grading on completion??? We aren't in elementary school, there should be no ""participation"" awards. The average for major assignments hovers around 95% in many classes. Having seen what other people are submitting for these assignments, I am astounded that instructors are handing out full credit to the majority of students. 

For example, INST327 is many student's first introduction to SQL, a database coding language. The class itself is not exceptionally challenging, but it is understandable why many people would find learning a new coding language to be a daunting task. We have ONE weekly individual assignment graded on correctness. My professor decided to grade last week's individual assignment on completion AFTER everyone had submitted. The topic covered was arguably the most challenging subject in the entire class: Normalization. I spent hours going to TA office hours, communicating with the instructional staff, and working on it independently, just to get the same grade as the people who started it the night it was due (I am in a group for that class and they were all looking for help on the beginning of the assignment at 10pm that same night). Even worse, I looked over the answer key and saw that I did the entire process correctly, and will not be credited for that.

This is literally the only type of assignment in the class that holds people accountable for actually learning, understanding, and applying what we learn. This wouldn't be so bad if the only other assignments we have graded on correctness were the semester-long group project. This means that the lack of accountability towards these students indirectly impacts me through this group work. My group members have a concerning lack of understanding about SQL and have not once attended office hours to seek assistance. Not only do they have an inability to code, but they don't seem to have a conceptual understanding of databases either. For instance, one group member simply had to write 10 questions that our database could answer (who, what, when, where, why level questions. Nothing crazy or groundbreaking here; anyone could accomplish this without any coding knowledge). I went to look over the questions they wrote and not only were they incomplete, but every single one was completely unrelated to our database, meaning I had to do that section on top of what I was originally assigned to complete (the sections I ended up doing were literally worth over 50% of the entire assignment). Imagine having a database that listed employees names, date of hire, and where they got their college degree. A question you may ask would be ""from what college do we hire the most alumni?"" My group member was writing questions along the lines of ""how much money do our employees make,"" which is literally not available in that data.

This next group assignment for the project requires everyone in the group to understand and apply Normalization to our dataset. It includes a writeup about why we chose to Normalize in that specific way. It is the EXACT same thing as last week's individual assignment (the one that was spontaneously graded on completion). So basically, because nobody was held accountable for understanding Normalization with last week's assignment, I am once again stuck normalizing a complex dataset without the help of my group members (I have been communicating this to the instructional staff and there's not much to do besides give them poor ratings/explanations during peer-check ins). Even worse, because they also lack the conceptual understanding, I don't think they will be able to do the writeup either, since they can't explain relationships, linking tables, composite primary keys, etc.

My professor sent out an ELMS announcement to let the class know that last week's individual assignment was graded on completion. Myself and another student posted a public comment that we felt it was unfair and requested extra credit for the students who were correct. Another student replied ""I disagree since that would lower another idea and expectation, which leads to unfairness."" What does that even mean??? Not only is that sentence borderline unintelligible, but what on god's green earth could ""lead to unfairness"" when you give credit where credit is due and hole people accountable? Have we really sunk so low as to believing that on a college level, students applying their understanding to an assignment, and then being given a grade that reflects this, is somehow ""lowering an idea and expectation?"" I know we aren't an ivy league, but I really thought that UMD was better than this.

I'm genuinely so tired. I would have no problem doing these large projects solo over groups. It has become more work being in a group than just doing everything myself because I have to constantly be the one to reach out to them with reminders, tell them when to meet, set up meetings, ask them questions, tell them what they need to do, etc. Nobody ever seems to just figure out what they need to do on their own. Its like they need a chaperone to hold their had all the way through. I shouldn't have to feel like an elementary school teacher in a college level class. I've done everything in my power to try to communicate this to groups time and time again, and I've gone as far as reaching out to the instructors to request guidance. Its ridiculous that these people are getting the same grade as me for an assignment they didn't do so much as READ. I have to genuinely BEG group members to communicate, to come to a 20 minute weekly Zoom meeting, and to just DO their part of a project.

I'm literally exhausted for all the wrong reasons. It would be one thing if the course load was what was pushing me to my limits, but it is entirely the issue of how iSchool professors grade and how iSchool students act in group projects.

The new initiatives include an embedded services program and the Mental Health Emergency Assessment and Response Team, dubbed “MHEART.” The programs are part of a broader effort to refine the counseling center’s processes, according to the center’s director Chetan Joshi.  
  
The embedded services program, which launched in August, integrates counselors within specific colleges and schools across this university, according to AnTanique Buckley, the engineering school’s embedded counselor. The program’s counselors complete initial mental health assessments on a more personal level, Buckley said.  
  
The MHEART program aims to address shortfalls in responses to mental health emergencies by police officers, who often approach situations with a law-enforcement perspective, said Amy Johnson, the MHEART clinician.

"People laughing and talking, cheering, and laughing really loudly for hours within South Campus Commons 6 area at midnight. Anyone else hears it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1g76m85/people_laughing_and_talking_cheering_and_laughing/,27,11,2024-10-19 11:13:50,"
The past two weekends, I have had trouble sleeping because I keep hearing the same students within the South Campus Commons area (really close to SCC6, if not within it) who have been talking really loudly and laughing for hours starting from around midnight. It was repetitive talking, loud cheering, and laughing for a really long time and it has been bothering my sleep.

I know it's the weekend, but just because they might not have something the next day and are able to sleep in the following morning doesn't mean they should ignore other people's sleep, because you never know if others have something important going on the next day. (Again, hasn't just been last night, literally every Friday, Saturday or Sunday night for the past two weeks). Last week it happened 3 nights in a row. 
Sometimes it would be so loud that I would even be woken up in the middle of the night, so getting a lack of sleep whenever this happens is really inevitable for me. Besides, whether the students involved live in these dorms or not, I am pretty sure quiet hours from Friday to Sunday nights apply starting from midnight and their yelling and talking starts from around then. Regardless, I feel that it is selfish behavior because even though they might have no plans the next day and have the privilege to sleep in the following morning, there could be students who have to wake up early the next morning for something important and couldn't get enough sleep because of them. (I have to wake up early on Saturdays for work, so this situation has been so frustrating)

Anyone else who lives around the area feel the same and has had sleep problems because of it?"

However, I'd like to develop my HCI skills on a strong tech foundation bc my goal is to connect technology and humans. I believe a deep understanding of tech is important for enhancing my competitive abilities.

Struggling to Organize Your College Schedule? Try “August”!!!!,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g70p44,0,10,2024-10-19 04:02:19,"Hi, I’m a junior computer science student at UMD.

August is an app designed for college students (currently only supports UMD) who find it tough to organize their schedules.

With August, you can easily create a clear schedule based on your classes and activities. The app includes filters that let you customize your timetable, such as choosing when your day starts, how many back-to-back classes you want, and setting the minimum or maximum gaps between lectures. 

The best part? You can share your schedule with friends! Whether you’re trying to plan a hangout or just want to compare free time, adding your friends allows you to view their schedules in the app. You can even access schedules from junior or senior friends to help plan your own course registration. For example, if you're struggling with registering for Spring 2025 classes, referencing a senior friend’s past schedule can be a game-changer. 

And let's be honest—it looks way better than Coursicle and other scheduling apps out there.

Check out August and take the hassle out of schedule planning!

Flies and gnats at the Y,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1g65ojb/flies_and_gnats_at_the_y/,12,3,2024-10-18 00:29:11,"I barely missed the dining hall AMA, and now the post is locked, so I’m posting my question here. The Y has a huge problem with flies and gnats. I’ve personally experienced flies and gnats landing on my plate multiple times, and I’ve also seen them land on the food at the buffet stations. The south campus dining hall used to have the same issue, but luckily they turned on the flying insect light traps this semester, so I haven't had any problems there. Could we do something similar at the Y?"

I will begin by saying I’m not a student here, but I do frequent the campus to see friends who are students and who work here. If I were a student at UMD, I would organize to have the construction for this metro going through campus to stop. 
Think about how nice your campus is right now. Now imagine a train honking right by your dorm or while you’re in class. Then there is of course, the possibility of watching your friends get hit by the train because they decided to hop the rail bc they’re running late to class or because they were too preoccupied with having headphones in. Not to mention the dead squirrels you’ll likely see.
Why didn’t they think to make the metro go around campus? A stop at the stadium and a stop right by Trader Joe’s. In addition, it is such a headache driving through the parking lot by Ludwig Field. There is no sidewalk for students/bikers/scooters and somehow they think there’s ample space for buses to go through and make it a two-way. Have you also seen or driven on the tracks on Campus Drive? I don’t know where they got the idea that there’s enough space for cars to drive next to these trains.

Do something before it’s too late."

Anyone have any experience or advice with this? The website says:  
  
""A student can cancel this agreement only upon documentation of valid grounds. Grounds for cancellation include the following: withdrawal from all classes; graduation; transfer to another institution or other disenrollment; student teaching placement or co-op work in conjunction with a University-sponsored accredited program; and participation in Study Abroad. Any cancellation granted based on a resident request made under false pretenses will be deemed null and void, and the resident will remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, reassigned to housing, and required to participate in an approved dining plan. In addition, any cancellation made under false pretenses may result in referral of the resident to the Office of Student Conduct for disciplinary action.""

I don't exactly fall under any of those grounds so will my request just be immeditately denied?

It’s also ILLEGAL! MD Transportation Code Section 21-1210(a). 

The reason everyone hates e-scooter users is because half of y’all have no respect for our laws, the people around you, or even yourselves. Making the entire community worse, including yourself with reckless behavior is the definition of idiocy. I know that most of the e-scooter users can’t read, so if you know any please tell them about the law.

The display, called “VOTE (Fearlessly)!,” opened on Sept. 4 in Tawes Plaza as part of NEXTNow Fest, according to Craig Kier, a music professor and the director of this university’s Arts for All initiative, which aims to tackle world challenges and foster dialogue using people-centered approaches.

Since then, the display has moved to several locations across campus, including SECU Stadium, outside Thurgood Marshall Hall and in the Heritage Community courtyard, Kier said.

The display itself is a tall, yellow and black tower that opens up to become a wide table where students can receive resources to help with the voting process, including on-site registration and polling location information.

“We wanted it to be also welcoming and to make people curious,” said Ronit Eisenbach, an architecture professor and the director of the creative placemaking minor.

The solution is to attack the masculinity of male scooter drivers.

  
So men probably make up 50% of all scooter drivers an probably 80% of all scooter incident. I say 80% because men generally are more reckless. So why don't we manipulate their want for masculinity?

Biking is way more masculine. Think about it. Biking means sweating, using actual leg muscles, and battling hills. You’re basically channeling your inner warrior every time you hop on a bike. There’s effort involved, grit. You push pedals, fight the wind, feel the burn in your thighs. You’re a gladiator, going to battle.

On a scooter? You’re just… *standing there.* No effort. No work. You just coast along like you’re casually floating to brunch. How can you call yourself a man while riding something that barely requires you to move your own body?

  
Just use these points and the scooter problem will theoretically reduce by 50%."

"New UMD cafe in IDEA Factory promotes food entrepreneurship, innovation
",https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/1g49onv/new_umd_cafe_in_idea_factory_promotes_food/,23,1,2024-10-15 14:57:36,"University of Maryland Dining Services and the IDEA Central Cafe have partnered with xFoundry to create DeliXious Labs, a cafe that incorporates food technology into its menu, in the E.A. Fernandez IDEA Factory.

DeliXious Labs wants to “lower the barrier to food entrepreneurship” for community members by allowing students and outside local businesses to test specific ingredients, recipes or products in the cafe and receive consumer feedback, according to Dr. Phillip Alvarez, xFoundry’s associate director of ventures and partnerships. xFoundry is an organization at this university that aims to foster student innovation.

Alvarez defines food entrepreneurship as anything from opening a new restaurant, to making a kitchen robot, growing a new food or participating in other aspects of the food supply chain. DeliXious Labs is a good way for food entrepreneurs to debut their products, he said.

Tenants will cycle through the cafe, Alvarez said. The cafe’s current tenant is Kraveworthy Kitchens, a micro food hall with an organic plant-based menu, according to xFoundry’s website.

(for context, im a freshman.)

im debating right now if i want to take econ 321 next semester so that i can take econ 422 during fall semester of next school year. (this would be my freshman year.) the other option is to take stat400 next semester, stat401 fall semester of 2025, and econ 422 spring semester of 2026.

ive heard that econ 422 is the most important course in the major so idk if its worth taking the shorter way (econ 321 next semester) in order to take econ 422 asap, or if i should go through the stat sequence of stat 400 to stat 401 and take econ 422 after im done."
