Every year I have a hard reminder that Tech has its prestige for a reason,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1gvzpw8/every_year_i_have_a_hard_reminder_that_tech_has/,141,39,2024-11-20 21:12:11,"LMAO completely just posting this to comfort myself but I just took my 3rd CS2050 (discrete math) exam and good lord I got humbled all to hell. The craziest part was that Ive been doing so good in my previous exams (High A for 1 and High B for 2) and HWs (average = high A), but something about the content and timing this exam screwed me up-I completely blanked and over half of that exam I didnt fill proper answers, if any at all.

It doesn't help either that I have been dealing with workload pile up from my other classes and job interviews alongside poor sleep so discrete was on the backburner because I put too much faith in my good track record with the class. I went from planning a smooth A to calculating how much I need just to keep a B by the end. 

Its my 3rd year here and classes still find a way to remind me that I go to Georgia Tech, and the reason people gasp or congratulate me when they hear that is because Tech IS a top-tier institution. Most classes here will have 1/2 the class find it easy as cake and the other 1/2 struggle to pass. It really is a test to your ability not only to learn, but to adapt to the workload and show resilience. IDK, I guess I just have to tell myself that the other exams will balance it out, even after they removed the ""1 test drop"" that they had previous semesters :/ (although now would be a great time for them to bring it back LMAO).

Stupid Housing Loaner Card Policies,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1gvaitj/stupid_housing_loaner_card_policies/,55,18,2024-11-19 22:55:01,"My room's locks got switched out to the BuzzCard locks and earlier today, my dumbass left my card in my BuzzCard in my room so had to go to WCHO to get a loaner key since none of my roommates were in the room.

I arrive there and ask for a loaner card and they make me sign this form saying that I'll need to pay $50 or $100 for a replacement if this happens 3 times to re-core the lock for security purposes (pretty much the same one as physical keys, but doesn't this defeat the purpose of electronic locks?).

I used the loaner card successfully to get in my building, but the card doesn't work for my room even though I tried multiple times. So I head back to WCHO to ask and they say it takes time to update so it should work after some time.

After I wait for a couple of minutes, it works, I grab my BuzzCard and go back to WCHO to return the loaner card. As I leave, I was stopped and told that it might take 5 to 10 minutes until my BuzzCard works again since it is locked while the loaner card is checked out. (still don't think this is necessary...I literally had the loaner card for like 15 minutes max). Of course, the card doesn't work to enter the building when I get there, but after a couple of minutes, I entered with someone else who was also entering my building. I get to my room and try my BuzzCard, which as you expected, does not work. *I just assumed I'd wait like 5 minutes with the loaner card.*

I tried every 2 or 3 minutes, until about 15 minutes passed, I contemplated going back to ask again, but really wanted to avoid walking back for the 4th time. I give it another 10 minutes, the card still doesn't work, so I head back for the FOURTH TIME. I enter and ask about it again and the response that I get is ""I just updated it 2 minutes ago""...*HELLO?! IT'S BEEN 30 MINUTES??*

Anyways, almost an hour after I got locked out I finally got back in my room again (and it worked pretty much instantly after it was updated). I really think these BuzzCard locks are making people's experience worse (probably for RAs as well with the number of lockouts while they're on duty) and also worsening security. Just on my floor, I've seen people taping up their locks or leaving their doors open all day so they don't get locked out. If they had to implement this at least they could have after mobile credentials became available since people are more likely to have phones with them than their wallets, but who knows what happened to that project. (but seriously, if [all these schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_campus_identifications_in_mobile_wallets) can have mobile credentials why can't we?)

**Tl;dr - I was locked out of my room for an hour and had to go to WCHO 4 times because they took ages to update the access on the cards. BuzzCard locks are bad for security and student experience at the moment and should only have been implemented once mobile credentials are available.**"

I want a career where I can make stuff and be more hands-on, but from the research I had done, there is a potential for me to do that with an IE degree. So, I thought maybe I would do that and minor and ID. However, now I am not so sure how things would work, and I was hoping to get some perspective. I plan to meet with an exploratory advisor to discuss more, but I've already been doing a lot of research. Hoping to get some insight from anyone on this sub if yall have time.

Edit: Also another thing that has been weighing on my decision is GPA, I know the courses get really hard but I can't afford to attend tech without scholarships like Zell Miller which require 3.3 minimum I believe. So if anyone can comment on that, that'd be helpful too"

First of all, GT has to win out and go 5-3 in conference. Clemson already has 6 wins, so they would play Clemson in the ACC championship. Thus, NO OTHER TEAM can have more than 5 wins, and then GT has to win the tiebreaker between all 5-3 teams. This means Miami and SMU have to lose out, as well as some other things, listed below:



ALL THESE GAMES NEED TO GO THIS WAY:

GT > NC St

Cal > SMU

BC > SMU

UVA > SMU

WF > Miami

Syracuse > Miami

Duke > VT

Duke > WF

UNC > BC

UNC > NC St

UNC > WF

Pitt > Louisville

Stanford > Louisville

BC > Pitt

Clemson > Pitt

Cal > Syracuse

VT > UVA



IF ALL OF THIS HAPPENS, THEN THE ACC STANDINGS WILL HAVE

7-1 Clemson

5-3 GT, SMU, Miami, Duke, UNC

4-4 and below: everyone else



So then it goes to tiebreakers: which are listed here in Section B. Three (or More) Team Tie: [https://theacc.com/documents/2023/5/17/ACC\_FOOTBALL\_TIEBREAKER\_POLICY.pdf](https://theacc.com/documents/2023/5/17/ACC_FOOTBALL_TIEBREAKER_POLICY.pdf)

Going down the list of tiebreakers for GT, SMU, Miami, Duke, UNC:

1. The first tiebreaker doesn't apply because the teams are not all common opponents (EX: GT did not play SMU)

2. The 2nd tiebreaker does not apply. No team has beaten all other teams or lost to all other teams

3. The only common opponent between all 5 of these teams is FSU, which all 5 teams have beaten, so that doesn't help

4. Again, the only common opponent is FSU. Doesn't apply

5. NOW things get interesting: Calculating the combined conference win percentage of opponents (I'm assuming by their wording that conference win percentage is all that matters, otherwise things may be a bit weirder): GT and Duke are tied with a conference opponent win percentage of 48.4%.



After this, Duke and GT would then move into a 2-team tiebreaker for who gets the final spot, at which point GT would have the H2H advantage and would advance to face Clemson in the ACC Championship game"

I live on east campus and am sick and tired of seeing so much trash in the recycling dumpster and vice versa. Many people put time and effort into sorting and cleaning their recycling and don't want their effort ending up in a landfill because you contaminated it.

Recycling **can NOT be bagged**.

Here are some things I commonly see in the dumpster that are **not** recyclable:

* Potato chips bags
* ramen packets
* plastic utensils
* Straws
* Styrofoam packing (Take to Kendeda)
* Plastic shopping bags (Take to Kendeda or PO)
* Bubble mailers (Take to Kendeda or PO)
* Plastic film and small bags

Please collapse your cardboard boxes too. It only takes ten seconds and saves so much space for the rest of us.

""you must complete the I-20/DS-2019 form request in order to obtain your Georgia Tech I-20 form. OIE asks that you complete this process no later than within 2 weeks of the start of your admission term.""

And the next term is starting on January 5 so 2 weeks prior to it should be Dec 22. So what's the due date Nov 1 or Dec 22?

I have tried reaching out to them a couple of times via mail in the last couple of days but haven't heard back anything.

Has any of you faced a similar situation like this or do you know what could I do next?

* **Effective Nov. 11:**¬†Duo telephony will no longer be offered as a 2FA method for Georgia Tech users when logging in to OneUSG Connect. 
* **Effective Dec. 3:** Duo telephony will no longer be offered as a 2FA method into *any* Georgia Tech login system (Banner, Single-Sign On, Outlook, etc.)
* The telephony method will, however, remain an option for user account-recovery in Passport. 
* OIT will work with campus members, on a case-by-case basis, if there are circumstances that require their continued use of Duo telephony 2FA.

If you don't use Duo telephony as a 2FA method of choice, great -- there is nothing you need to do! If you *are* a current Duo telephony user, please visit the [Two-Factor Authentication at Georgia Tech website](https://oit.gatech.edu/two-factor-authentication) to learn about alternative methods available to you. 

If you may require a telephony exception, have questions about the Duo telephony 2FA sunset, or have questions in general about 2FA options available to protect your campus accounts, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at [support@oit.gatech.edu](mailto:support@oit.gatech.edu). We are here to assist you.  
  
Please stay safe online, everyone."

"Any insights into academic changes, post pandemic and with generative AI?",https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1gjfjqx/any_insights_into_academic_changes_post_pandemic/,94,37,2024-11-04 14:29:10,"I've observed a couple changes in my classroom post-pandemic and with the introduction of generative AI:

1. Fewer students are attending in-person classes
2. More students are cheating

This is not a GT issue--it's happening everywhere, according to various faculty discussion groups. I kinda understand why people want to watch videos on increased speed without leaving their dorm. But students often don't really pay attention to recordings, miss critical instructions.... and if everything is online, why are we all even here?

Some of the cheating is generatie AI (and i think we need to teach students to use it responsibly, not ban it). But some of the cheating is not AI-related. Maybe I was just naive as an instructor and because of ChatGPT I'm being more careful? I hate playing integrity cop (my sadness about this is deep), but it feels like I have a duty to preserve the integrity of the process.

My concern is that the entire model of a face-to-face university education is eventually endangered if we don't solve these issues. Any insights? And how do you think faculty should respond to these challenges?"

I had to wake up at 7:30 am everyday and went to class diligently. However, something changed after I realized that the classes don't have an effect on my actual GPA, I did not see those professors for the next four weeks. This program was actually very prophetic in how my life at Georgia Tech would evolve.

To sum up 3 years, I didn't go to my classes. Not even classes that had attendance (they would usually do a Canvas quiz and I'd just check my phone from time to time). Now I'm a 4th year and, even though I maintained not only a high GPA but also 8+ hours of sleep nightly, what was sacrificed was my attendance to classes. I try to think about what I've learned in my major and I can't think of anything because I didn't engage with my professors. GAHHH

I've been trying to change this over the past few weeks, but to no avail. Like this week, I really intended to go to my classes. But yesterday, all my classes were virtual, and I was like ""oh I'll just watch the recordings later"" knowing damn well my lazy ass will not be doing that. Even today, I was planning to go to my classes, but I slept through my alarm and didn't go to my 9:30am class üò≠ (i went to my 3:30pm one, but I felt bad bc I've not seen the professor in a month and someone said that only 5 students attended last class. I just feel bad that I'm contributing to high absence rates).

In hindsight, I wish I actually understood the content and interacted with the professors more instead of just studying for an exam. Yeah, I got good grades, but I can't really explain in-depth concepts of the courses I took in the past, besides a select handful of classes.

I'm also stressed because I don't even think i like my major (EnvE + ALIS) but I don't know what I would like :/ Rant over

My old college work well with that method but what I have noticed from attending Gatech is that more classes focus on exam grades and not the course work. I have a 2 credit Linear Algebra I am taking right now and I have a 60% because I bombed the first 2 exams.

I would need (at most) a 60% on the last midterm and an 80% on the final to pass with a 70%. The final will be a higher weight then and my lowest midterm weight would go down too.

I plan to immediately start practicing all the older exams for my next midterm and try to learn about exam concepts. There are multiple practice exams for each exam. I also plan to utilize office hours for TA and the Professor.  I have a disability that effects my cognitive function, so storing information in my brain is harder, hence why I tend to be worse at exams than the HW.

I have been in this situation before yet was able to pass however that was at another college.

I am just looking for advice because I do not have anyone to talk to, but the decision date is coming up.

What‚Äôs the Economics/LMC scene at GAtech like right now?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1g4ms9b/whats_the_economicslmc_scene_at_gatech_like_right/,24,13,2024-10-16 00:29:14,"Hello! I‚Äôm a transfer student who just came from a local college in Georgia. Im studying ISYE right now, but I‚Äôm getting hung up on some of the math courses (Discrete in particular is killing me). I know that ISYE is comparably easy when compared to other Engineering majors, but I‚Äôm not sure I want to pursue something like that (I could make it through, but it wouldn‚Äôt be pretty for my GPA).

Right now, I‚Äôm considering a few options:


1. Thug it out with ISYE. The problems with this are self-evident. I‚Äôm not very good at mathematical thinking and I just don‚Äôt think I have the mind for it like my peers do.

2. Do some sort of LMC or Econ degree. I loved Econ and Communications in high school and I‚Äôm told that it isn‚Äôt a bad program. I know there‚Äôs lots of stats stuff but I haven‚Äôt done that yet to know if I‚Äôll hate it. This is the choice I lean most towards at the moment.

3. Do business. This one is a pretty clear choice, but honestly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like business from a more ethical standpoint. It‚Äôs an undergrad degree, so it doesn‚Äôt matter much, but I feel like I could choose a different degree and probably be fine? I‚Äôm not sure.

Thank you all for your input. I know that it‚Äôs an undergrad degree, so I feel confident in saying that once I land the first few internships or jobs, I‚Äôll be okay, but this decision has been eating me up for a while now.

I hope you all have a great day!"

TLDR: i messed up but the situation due to construction is getting out of hand.

ER51 lot has been under construction the entire year so far. There are practically no spots left for this parking permit as a result. When I purchased my permit there was NO warning and NO care to allow us to switch to other lots--and now I have been paying the price the whole year. They seem very overzealous to ticket and tow me over accidentally parking in ""RSER51"" which I thought indicated it was ONLY for ER51 patrons. Apparently this code means it's a reserved spot--so my $800 that I worked for to pay for my spot means nothing even with the code for ER51. Poor signage and  low effort to contact the owners of these vehicles is costing us. Not only that but I have had at least 18 days where I cannot park in my lot due to games or other events. I am extremely frustrated; I use my car to get to work, I don't just have it on campus for shits and giggles. I really wish there was more done about this."

I never thought I would end up at Tech because truly I applied on the whim. However the school I wanted to go to didn‚Äôt really work out especially cost wise. So here I am at the next best option.

I have classes 5 days a week (most of which are 8:00 ams) so not only do I have to get up 2 hours earlier than most people but I also get home later which really sets me back when it comes to doing homework or studying, because by the time I get home I just want to rest.

I have been doing my assignments on time however I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm learning anything. It feels as if I‚Äôm doing the work just to do the work.

I‚Äôve thrived on academic validation my whole life, so seeing how I‚Äôm struggling with my classes hurts me as a person. I want to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA for my scholarship but at this rate it‚Äôs just so hard.

I‚Äôve went to tutoring, I‚Äôve went to office hours, I‚Äôve went to recitations, and I‚Äôve even done study groups. But barely have they helped. I even have regular appointments at the mental health resource center. But it has truly taken such a toll on my emotional and mental state because in all honestly I feel stupid and dumb being at tech and just so behind everyone else. Everyone seems like they know what they‚Äôre doing and what they want to be in life and here I am just stuck. 

I‚Äôm so tired and burnt out man like what can I do?? Seriously. I have no motivation, I feel burnt out and like my brain is fried, and every Sunday is like hell cause i know what the week holds.

I really feel like not many people actually come out and say how bad they‚Äôre struggling. So here I am actually saying I am STRUGGLING. Any advice? Or if anyone can relate please or have been through this, please tell me how you managed. And if anyone wants to be my mentor or something, please let me know cause I could really use one."

Struggling this semester ‚Äì what steps can I take?,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1fximji/struggling_this_semester_what_steps_can_i_take/,38,11,2024-10-06 15:09:01,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm a student who just returned to Tech this semester after going through the readmission process. Unfortunately, things have been really rough since the start. Literally a day before the semester began, some unexpected issues with my housing came up, and I ended up having to live in my car for the first six weeks of the semester. While my housing situation has stabilized now, my commute is about 40 minutes each way (without traffic), which is still adding a lot of stress.

All of this combined has put me in a constant game of catch-up. I‚Äôm barely finishing homework on time, and when midterms came around, I had to choose between studying or completing assignments. I‚Äôve been trying really hard to hold everything together, but I feel like I‚Äôm slowly losing my grip.

My grades have been slipping, and I‚Äôve had the worst midterm performances of my academic career so far (I got a 51, 70, 73, 70, and 87). I feel like I‚Äôm in a hole that‚Äôs getting deeper at a rate of 3x, and I can only climb out at 2x. I‚Äôm really starting to lose hope and can‚Äôt see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Is there anything I can do to maybe buy myself some time, or any steps I can take to get back on track? Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks."

"Student football fans, we have some things to work on",https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1fxabl0/student_football_fans_we_have_some_things_to_work/,154,8,2024-10-06 06:30:05,"First off, it is amazing we are filling out BOTH endzones. I am so excited about how far we've come. This post is a little bit of venting and some constructive criticism about a few incidents during the Duke game, but overall, it is incredible to see our student body showing out to cheer on the Jackets!

Still, there are a few things we need to improve on to be the fanbase these players deserve.

Most importantly, I think we can all agree that the trash thrown on the field on at least three occasions was completely unacceptable. As a fanbase and school, we have a reputation to develop and uphold, and we will not be like certain other fanbases in our state and conference. If you need a more tangible reason, our team will be penalized during the game and that could result in serious consequences within the game.

Now, I'm sure the assholes actually doing this stuff aren't going to be reading this post. All I ask for from y'all is a zero tolerance for these types of things and make sure ""fans"" like this know that they do not belong in the student section.

On a less serious note, we really need to shut up when our offense is on the field. Chanting and cheering is cool when the stakes aren't too high, but if our team is trying to finish off a drive in the redzone, it does not help when their fans are shouting at them. Consistent homefield advantage is incredibly important and we will desperately need it against Notre Dame and Miami in the coming weeks. Help me out here and let your friends know to quiet down when we have the ball.

On the other hand, we have been fantastic in bringing the noise when we're on defense. Keep that up and turn it up to 11!

Maybe I'm overreacting to some of this stuff, and feel free to call me out if that's the case. This is just an extremely valuable aspect of student life for me and I felt like something needed to be said.

Thank you to all who have been showing out to these games. We've had some growing pains to go through, but I believe we are on track to make Bobby Dodd one of the best stadium environments in the country.

Go Jackets!"

Second guessing my internship :(,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1fuwrzf/second_guessing_my_internship/,40,27,2024-10-03 01:44:30,"So I'm a 4th year EnvE + ALIS major (and CHIN minor) and my original graduation date was fall 2025. I got this internship offer in the spring and I'm really excited, but it's going to push my graduation date to spring 2026. I mean, there's nothing wrong with graduating spring 2026, but I feel like I need to ""get in the work force"" as fast as possible. I talked to both my ALIS and EnvE advisors and they were both basically like ""nope not at all,"" but I still am delusional thinking I may be able to pull it off.

The thing is: I have 12 classes left (4 KOR, 8 CEE)...Here was my plan for the spring:

- KOR 4002 (I talked with the professor beforehand and can do the class online)

- VIP (any VIP class, but just for 1 credit b/c I've taken a VIP class before for 2 credits)

- ECON 2105 (there was a section that was async this semester so I'm just praying there is an async one next semester)

- I was thinking of doing CEE research as well...

I was thinking I could take 4 classes over the summer, but higher level CEE classes aren't usually offered over the summer, same thing with Korean.

I know this sounds like super duper crazy and like out of it, but idk...I already feel bad about the possibility of me being a full on fifth year. I heard Cabrera speak yesterday saying ""oh yeah, we're not the best with 4 year graduation rate, we need to work on that"" as if it's the student's fault.

Should I just accept defeat and plan to graduate spring 2026? Or is there a slim chance I can pull this off and graduate a semester early?"

Super disappointed that it is now 3-4 car cycles per pedestrian cycle. We don‚Äôt have time to wait five minutes to cross one street. Now people are forced to either jaywalk the intersection, or stand there forever, which makes it less safe than what we had before. Imo it‚Äôs one step forward, but two steps back for pedestrian walkability on campus."

I'm a grad student who took 15 creds (yes 15, but there's a reason) because I was primarily unsure of one of the courses I took and wanted to have a backup option. Now we are in that phase of the semester when I am highly rethinking my decision of even taking this course. To clarify, this course was optional, I don't have to take it so even if I withdraw it will have no impact. The reason why I took it is that I am very, very interested in the course content. I am unfamiliar with this topic and wanted to learn more about it. I also clarified with the professor if any background knowledge is required for this course, but they reassured me that I will be fine.

Now the problem is, I did not know how mismanaged the course was and dry the lectures will be. The professor just reads from slides, and the projects are killing me. It is very hard for me to go to office hours because they clash with my other classes. That said I did go to TAs a couple of times, but the course content is really hard, and I feel like I don't even understand what they are teaching me. I know, I sound dumb. Maybe it's the background issue, I don't know. But I assure I have been trying hard so idk what's wrong. I have only slept for 8-10 hours in the past 5 days because of a project that was due for this course. I fear my other courses will be compromised if this continues (which I obviously don't want). I personally think, I can't do this anymore. But I also don't want to withdraw because as I said, I love the course content. I want to learn. It's just the course design and difficulty that is making it so hard for me. I have considered declaring the course as pass/fail but I am unsure. Objectively speaking, what would be the ideal decision to make here? Should I really withdraw, or convert to pass/fail?"

I am originally from New Jersey but I registered to vote with only my Buzzcard. Its pretty easy! Please register to vote before the deadline of **Oct 7,2024!**

**If you're out of state and not from a swing state**, please consider registering to vote in Georgia because its status as a swing state gives its voters more voting power over the election. By registering to vote in Georgia, **you are forfeiting your right to vote in your previous state.**

Here's how I did it:

1. **I went to the** [Fulton County Voter Registration office in person](https://g.co/kgs/ZGdQDQi). The staff told me they prefer people register in person because it takes them a while to process mail-in registration forms, also trying to print out the mail in form was weird cause the formatting wont work with a normal US letter size paper.
2. **I** [**took MARTA from Midtown to Five Points**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AJ7RdoHnwGJY5DEr5) and walked 5 mins to the voter registration office. (You can just take the Gold bus to MARTA Midtown Station!)
3. I filled out a form in the office. It takes 2 mins to do.
4. **I presented my Buzzcard, and provided last 4 digits of my SSN.**¬†This is all they need. You DO NOT need to provide proof of address or a GA drivers license!¬†
5. **I checked my voter registration status afterward.** It takes 24-48 hours during business days to process your application. I visited [www.mvp.sos.ga.gov](http://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov) to check my status.

**How do I actually vote after registering?**

**Georgia Tech is actually an early voting site!**

When: Late October, 9am-5pm

Where: John Lewis Student Center, Southern Co Multicultural Program Lounge

However, the dates are currently inconsistent across different government websites. [Fultoncountyga.gov](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/inside-fulton-county/fulton-county-departments/registration-and-elections/early-voting-locations) and [ga.gov](https://mvp.sos.ga.gov/s/advanced-voting-location-information?election=a0p3d00000LWdF5AAL&countyName=FULTON&page=advpollingplace) says its Oct 24-25, the voter registration office told me in person its Oct 29-30... so I'm not totally sure. I called the voter registration office again to make sure so I'll update this post when its absolutely confirmed.

Please consider voting early to beat the poll lines before election day!

EDIT: Its Five Points, not little five points, thanks for pointing out the typo! Also added a heads up that registering to vote in GA forfeits your right to vote in your previous state

EDIT: By ""proof of address"" I mean you do not need to provide a pay stub or a bill with your address that is evidence you live there. You only need to write in your residential address and mailing address."

The right-hand exit lane on Williams Street is blind to south-traveling pedestrians and scooters. I've been asking someone to put up a mirror and a caution sign for years... since the advent of scooters, which make the problem scarier.

Im a born-and-raised Floridian, so hurricanes, tropical storms, etc. never bothered me since we got alot of them and knew how to deal/prep. I do want to say though that it would be best to keep an eye on Hurricane Helene throughout this week. As of now, it is projected to pass ATL on \~Friday as a tropical depression. However, it has the potential to be up to a Cat. 4 on the FL panhandle, which can have ripple effects into atlanta since its path is projected to go right over us.

Said he was thinking about going back to school because he saw that the state of GA has free tuition for seniors?
And he is pretty technically literate, (not just text, FB and email like many seniors).

He has had a PC since for over 30 years, (since DOS) does okay on MS Windows and most apps is not great on MS 365 but uses it. He doesn‚Äôt program but can use tools to make website, stuff like that.

He likes to learn and says there is a lot more there that interest him than when he first went (he is not an engineer) and also he is interested in AI a lot, and he says he would like to know more about it.
He left Tech in good standing but not with a great GPA from what I understand.  He‚Äôs in decent physical shape for his age but he‚Äôs not not going to be doing intramural as or anything, or for that matter probably wouldn‚Äôt take more than a couple courses at a time.

Is he correct about the state free senior tuition?

Does Tech have many/any senior students there?

Could he use his earlier credits, at least a couple years worth+, to earn a degree of some sort (that would thrill him.)

How well do the seniors fit in?

Are they well accepted by other students and professors?

Is this a good idea (my mom thinks it‚Äôs odd at best, doesn‚Äôt see the point, why does he want to, he‚Äôs not getting an entry job in his 70‚Äôs etc. etc.)

I've gotten 5 emails since last week asking if I want to sign a new lease for next year, so let me break down what my rent actually gets me:

* Card readers that don‚Äôt work. Like, they aren't even connected‚Äîliterally, not a single one in the building works.
* A bike storage room that you can‚Äôt get into unless you hunt down a security guard or employee to get a physical key.
* The rudest security guard I‚Äôve ever met (the bald guy who works weekends, iykyk).
* Maintenance that gaslights you into believing your broken appliances are fine, even when they‚Äôre clearly malfunctioning. (My dishwasher had a huge puddle of water underneath, and they refused to fix it. I had to replace the seals myself just to wash my dishes).
* A garage gate that‚Äôs stuck open, meaning anyone can park in the ‚Äúresident-only‚Äù lot.
* And today, we found out we‚Äôre down to just one working elevator for the entire building ‚Äî all 19 floors. Anyone who's been to U-House in the last few weeks knows we‚Äôve already been down one elevator, which they said would take over 4 weeks to fix.

The first screenshot is from the email I got today, the second is from a few days ago. Note that our B4 elevator has been out since the beginning of this month, and we only have 4 ‚Äî I also don't think that they‚Äôve fixed any elevator faster than a week.

Needless to say, unless they turn it around soon, I‚Äôm not renewing my lease for next year ‚Äî and neither should you."

A great way to celebrate is by Registering to Vote [https://vote.gov/](https://vote.gov/) if you are eligible to do so!  

Constitution Day commemorates the formation and signing of the U.S. Constitution by thirty-nine brave men on September 17, 1787, recognizing all who, are born in the U.S. or by naturalization, have become citizens. [http://www.constitutionday.com/](http://www.constitutionday.com/)¬†

September 17, Constitution Day (or Citizenship Day) is an American federal observance that recognizes the ratification of the United States Constitution and those who have become U.S. citizens. It is observed on September 17, the day the U.S. Constitutional Convention signed the Constitution in 1787. The law establishing the holiday was created in 2004 with the passage of an amendment by Senator Robert Byrd to the Omnibus spending bill of 2004. Before this law was enacted, the holiday was known as ""Citizenship Day"". In addition to renaming the holiday ""Constitution Day and Citizenship Day,"" the act mandates that all publicly funded educational institutions provide educational programming on the history of the American Constitution on that day. **In May 2005, the United States Department of Education announced the enactment of this law and that it would apply to any school receiving federal funds of any kind.**

**U.S. Dept of Education:** [**https://www2.ed.gov/policy/fund/guid/constitutionday.html**](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/fund/guid/constitutionday.html)Each educational institution that receives Federal funds for a fiscal year is required to hold an educational program about the U.S. Constitution for its students on September 17 (if it falls on a weekend; it should be held in the previous or next week).

**Georgia Dept. of Education:** [**https://www.gadoe.org/Curriculum-Instruction-and-Assessment/Curriculum-and-Instruction/Pages/Constitution-Day.aspx**](https://www.gadoe.org/Curriculum-Instruction-and-Assessment/Curriculum-and-Instruction/Pages/Constitution-Day.aspx)Public Law 108-447 requires the designation of Constitution Day and Citizenship Day on September 17 of each year. The purpose of Constitution Day and Citizenship Day is to commemorate the formation and signing on September 17, 1787, of the Constitution and recognize all who, by coming of age or by naturalization, have become citizens. ¬†Please remember to recognize September 17th, Constitution Day, in your system/school.

**Trivia:**

* The U.S. Constitution has 4,400 words. It is the oldest and shortest written Constitution of any major government in the world.
* Of the spelling errors in the Constitution, ""Pensylvania"" above the signers' names is probably the most glaring.
* Thomas Jefferson did not sign the Constitution.



**Regulatory reference:**

**¬ß106. Constitution Day and Citizenship Day**

(a)¬†Designation.-September 17 is designated as Constitution Day and Citizenship Day.

(b)¬†Purpose.-Constitution Day and Citizenship Day commemorate the formation and signing on September 17, 1787, of the Constitution and recognize all who, by coming of age or by naturalization, have become citizens.

I saw JW on Tech Green this morning and if you are looking for a church to join I wanted to warn you with a personal experience and some other resources-

My family friends are without an extended family because they decided to leave JW, and my best friend in the entire world grew up without the support of his grandpa and grandma. This is a friendly-looking group that will separate you from your close family and friends unless they are already in the church.

 I recommend you read up on the history of JW (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses), or just the criticisms and features that align with a ‚Äúcult‚Äù (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Jehovah's_Witnesses).

What do I even do here??? more context in caption,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fheos9,90,256,2024-09-15 15:08:07,"First I am aware I could've (maybe should've) gone to the dean for the absence but it's just a quiz and in the past this hasn't been an issue so I didn't think it was worth the extra work. I'm thinking of going now but want to know if there's anything I can do before going that far. 

Here's background info: 

I have a doctor's appt on Wednesday 9/18 when I also have a math quiz. 

Last week I told my prof and said I'd get him a note after the appt. 

(This is how I've always dealt with this type of problem since middle school and nobody has ever made a big deal out of it.)

When I told him this he said he wants a note before. I told him I can't do that (because who tf writes a note before the appt??). He insisted and I was running late so I said I'll see what I can do and left. 

The clinic says they won't write a note (not surprised). But I realized I can get a screenshot of my patient portal to show confirmation which I did. 

So I've emailed him and he wants me to schedule the quiz with the testing center any other time on 9/18 (I have exam accommodations) but I can't because it's too late. Doesn't matter though because I don't even have time on that day to schedule it anyway. 

I asked if I can take it on Thursday or Friday (only a day or two after everyone else) and he is stuck on doing it Wednesday. Now he's asking me to choose between missing class or taking the quiz. 

He hasn't responded since the last email I sent and I doubt he will so what do I do here?? 

Again I'm planning to go to the dean but I'd like advice if there's anything I can do before or how to approach the dean with this

Pls help and thanks lol "

Gave up other opportunities, missed job recruiting, and now I'm stuck wondering what to do next.

Hi, everyone.

This isn't a post against GT's decision‚Äîjust me sharing my story. I‚Äôm just a random Chinese student who was accepted into Georgia Tech‚Äôs Spring 2025 MSCS program in Shenzhen. [You may have heard about the decision to end Georgia Tech Shenzhen Institute (GTSI).](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1fb6kc4/georgia_tech_to_exit_georgia_tech_shenzhen/) Whether you agree with it or not, it‚Äôs drastically changed my life.

Three of my four undergraduate years were spent under Xi Jinping‚Äôs strict zero-COVID policy, forcing me to rely on poor online classes. I took control of my learning by using free resources from U.S. universities, which led to the idea of studying abroad. Then I found GT Shenzhen‚Äîthe only U.S. program I could afford. I gave up job hunting and a guaranteed spot in a Chinese grad program to focus on my application. Despite missing the 2024 fall deadline, I was admitted for Spring 2025.

And now, it‚Äôs all likely to be taken away.

I have to admit, I chose GT Shenzhen not just for its education and cost but because GT's reputation could make me more competitive in the global job market, giving me hope of finding a job overseas and escaping China. I understand GT‚Äôs decision‚Äîthe risks of collaborating with China are high. I also don‚Äôt want to see a future where dictators like Xi Jinping, Putin, and Kim Jong-un gain more power. In fact, I‚Äôve tried as much as I can to offer proxy services (a.k,a VPN) to my friends and classmates, because I believe that free access to information should be a fundamental right for everyone and I hope they can realize how evil these assholes are. So if I were an American, I would probably support this decision 100%.

Now, because of GT Shenzhen‚Äôs closure, I‚Äôm an unemployed man who missed the job window and doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs next. Just days ago, I was excited about choosing between GIOS and HCI as my first course. I wish GT will provide some other options to pursue my degree.

In the end, no matter how things turn out for me, I still to hope for a world that‚Äôs better and more open for everyone.

**FYI:** GTSI is currently working on a teach-out plan for existing students, but since there are only a handful of us admitted for Spring 2025, the most cost-effective solution seems to be rescinding our admissions. I don‚Äôt blame them; I‚Äôm just worried about my future."

It is hard and I get that. Recently I have had many people come to me feeling alone, and I want everyone to know that they are not alone. If you feel overwhelmed or stressed or anything I want you to know that I am here to pray for you. Please let me know and you don't even need to tell me what you need I can just pray for you. I care about you and you are valuable no matter what you get on that assignment, exam or if you get your internship. You are valuable for being uniquely you."
