Due to the poor lighting in this building, I'm considering not renewing my lease this year and entering the room draw again. My goal is to move into a 1-bedroom apartment in Meadows, but I’m concerned about the possibility of ending up off-campus, as my priority rank is relatively low.

I was wondering if any senior PhD students (G3, G4, etc.) managed to draw a 1-bedroom apartment last year? I understand that since Meadows had just opened, there might have been a larger number of rooms available then. However, I’m not sure if my ranking would have been high enough for a senior turn."

Previous resident question!,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1gho3rn/previous_resident_question/,1,0,2024-11-02 03:53:32,"Hi everyone! I certainly miss the area. I lived in the condos between Costco and the BMW. I accidentally had a pretty expensive car part shipped to my old condo in NJ, while I am living in NC. I don’t know anyone in the area to check but I was able to schedule a package pickup with FedEx. However, they went to pick it up and the package is missing. 

I am not really sure what to do? Should I call the police to report it missing and maybe they can talk to the new owners in my condo? The shipper does not have the package as it was not returned to sender.

My fear is that someone stole it, opened it, couldn’t figure out what it was and threw it away. It is an older car I’m rebuilding and a strange part and it was very difficult to find. 

I know it is my fault because I had thought I updated my address to my new one already.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you."

Seeking Stool Donor For Medical Procedure,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1g1e6tm/seeking_stool_donor_for_medical_procedure/,13,1,2024-10-11 16:42:05,"Mid-30s NJ resident here with a strange but totally serious request. I posted here a while back and the response was more positive than I expected, and I even found a potential donor that unfortunately didn't work out, so I thought I'd give it another shot. Apologies if this post breaks any sub rules. 

I've been dealing with a pretty intense functional GI disorder and after a whole lot of testing and 10+ different medications that didn't help I've come to the point where I can either resign myself to being sick permanently or I can attempt a pretty radical treatment called [FMT or Fecal Microbiota Transplant]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_microbiota_transplant) which, with stool from a high-quality donor, can help with a variety of conditions. [This webcomic explains it pretty well, believe it or not]( http://threewordphrase.com/donor.htm).

Pretty wild, I know. It's gross, but not as gross as being sick for the rest of my life would be, so I'm trying to have a sense of humor about it. When I first heard about it I had the same WTF reaction you're probably having now. This procedure is approved and highly effective for treatment of C. Difficile infection, has shown promising results in clinical trials for several GI issues, and is even being researched as treatment for issues in other areas of the body. [Here's an article about it from a few years back](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/excrement-experiment).

The donor criteria is extremely strict and unfortunately none of my friends or family qualify, so I figured I would see if a kind stranger from the internet might help me with this weird, awkward thing that could improve my life one million percent.

If you or someone you know meet the following base criteria and would be willing to explore being a donor, please reach out to me via PM here or e-mail fmtftact1@gmail.com
	

Male

Under 30 years old

Lean body type

Essentially perfect physical and mental health

No allergies or food sensitivities

Varied diet

Daily perfect stool production,  presenting as [Bristol Type 3 Stool]( https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c35d0b78-61cf-47f2-9c99-99c614898586/apt13746-fig-0001-m.png)



There are some more involved questions that would need to be answered, and a potential donor would have to be screened for pathogens, but after that all they would need to do is come to a convenient location and make a deposit, so to speak. I am local to North Jersey but will happily travel to make this happen.

Thanks for reading!"

Seriously, though, I am looking for locations that might fit the dark academia aesthetic. From what I am able to Google, I see some things that might work. But in researching, I want to see how locations connect and the layout.
More specific, is there a hallway, a window view, some library room, etc. that screams dark academia.

I really don't like microeconomics (eco 100), but I've heard it's a really easy class and a GPA booster. On the other hand, if I take a class I'm actually interested in (Cos 126 or 226 this fall), I'm worried that my GPA will suffer or I won't have enough time.

The suspect has been barred from campus. If you have any additional information related to the incidents that occurred last night, please contact the Department of Public Safety at 609-258-1000; in case of emergency, dial 911"

Does anyone have fast, unconventional, or otherwise (for one reason or another) better routes through or out of the language requirement? A language sequence known as a little easier than the rest? A summer trip that condenses the requirement into a semester and a few weeks abroad? Stuff in this vein. I hope and suspect there are others out there like me.

"Took my laptop to ""ZNS Computer Repair Princeton"" and they literally taped it together... ",https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1evlhn5/took_my_laptop_to_zns_computer_repair_princeton/,18,15,2024-08-18 22:10:41,"So, I recently had one of the worst experiences ever with ZNS Computer Repair Princeton and I am honestly at my wit’s end. I brought my laptop in for a simple screen repair (LCD lines at the bottom, which I later found out is easy to fix) because I use it for school and work and needed it done quickly. The owner promised he could fix it quickly and charged me $250.

When I got the laptop back, I was SHOCKED to see it TAPED together. Yep, instead of actually fixing the screen and properly reassembling the device, he glued and taped it! The casing around the screen is cracked and broken. On top of that, when I tried to turn it on at home, the screen didn’t even work!

I confronted the owner, and instead of taking responsibility, he accused me of breaking the screen! The absolute nerve. He didn’t send me the ""photos"" he claims to have taken before returning the laptop (because they don’t exist), and when I pushed him for a refund or some kind of compensation, he refused. He actually tried to justify it by saying he was “honest” with me throughout the process, like that makes up for ruining my laptop! I mean, honesty is the bare minimum, not something you use as an excuse to dodge responsibility. He ended up refunding me.

Now, the laptop is glued together because it won’t hold, and I’m stuck paying even more to get it properly repaired elsewhere. It’s infuriating, to say the least. I’ve had no choice but to pursue legal action, which is a whole other headache.

The cherry on top? I tried leaving 1-star reviews on Google Maps to warn others, but Google keeps removing them! I don’t understand why this is happening—it’s like I can’t even get a warning out to other people.

Seriously, DO NOT TRUST ZNS Computer Repair; in general, do not trust working-in-his-garage type of guys. They’ll take your money, destroy your device, and then blame you for their mistakes. You'll end up with more damages than previously.

I am a rising freshman at Princeton and plan to major in Neuroscience, Economics, or ORFE. I know that they are rather distinct, but I want to explore many different interests to see what truly sticks. 

My question is about math. For all of these majors, math is no doubt essential (less, maybe, for Neuroscience). I took AB and BC calc back in 11th grade and earned a 5 on the exam. I wasn't insanely confident in those classes but I got by. It would be helpful to have a refresher on the topics, but I think I could manage new material. 

I am wondering if there is a huge gap between 103, 104, 175, and 201. I have heard that all of these classes are greatly challenging, so I might as well go into the highest level that I can place into. I just wonder if this is good advice, or if it would be better to enter in at a lower level. 

I have also heard a lot about the EGR curriculum, and that it may be better to enter in that route as opposed to the MAT curriculum. I would love to hear any general advice about whether thats true. 

Also, I would suspect that things change every year and my experience will be unique. I would just love to hear if anyone was in a similar spot before and could offer some guidance now.

rising senior with an underwhelming past 3 years here …,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1e11qb6/rising_senior_with_an_underwhelming_past_3_years/,33,13,2024-07-11 22:34:06,"(To preface this, I have struggled with coping with severe depression+anxiety, some chronic illnesses, and also recently found out with a neuropsych that I have had undiagnosed ADHD and ASD for probably my entire life, which were probably major contributors to my experience here. I was hoping if anyone else is an upperclassman or even an underclassman experiencing similar feelings of inadequacy and regret when reflecting on their time here (or if anyone has graduated, if these feelings do get better or not)).

I recently read a [post from a graduated senior at Stanford](https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/1dkxmux/feel_like_a_failure_after_graduating/)that seemed to perfectly encapsulate how I'll probably feel a year from now. Going into my senior year at Princeton, I know that it was already an immense privilege to attend this school, something I had worked towards throughout my childhood, and I just ... kind of floated through it aimlessly?

When I was a prefrosh, I had so many visions and goals for myself that I thought I would work my ass off at Princeton to achieve. I was so inspired by the high-achieving students here who go on to attend top graduate schools, win prestigious fellowships and awards, etc. Perhaps I was too driven by extrinsic factors as I saw these measures of success as the only indicators of my worth. I didn't come from the best high school and felt an intense desire to ""prove"" myself all the time. I also could not wait to savor all those canonical features of American college life (making real close friends, going out/partying, doing all kinds of unexpected and random things that define one's youth, being in a relationship, etc.) as I was pretty sheltered growing up.

Fast forward to 3 years later and ... now what? Time passed like a blink of an eye from the moment I first moved into campus, and I am now spending almost every day of my summer as a rising senior, constantly reflecting. I'm beginning to compile my applications for physics Ph.D. programs and looking at requirements for fellowships... and realizing that I have mediocre to decent grades and research experience, but was never an impressive student. I slogged through each semester feeling like death, getting about 3 hours of sleep a day while still turning in everything last minute or groveling for extensions. I worked on all psets alone as most people in my department had formed small exclusive friend groups. I bombed many exams. I worsened my existing illnesses. I lost the passion I had for service and leadership in the community as I could barely take care of myself, and really struggled to make engaging and meaningful connections with faculty in my research experiences like my JPs due to extreme procrastination and fear of interacting with people in authority. I often felt like people were pitying me, or lost all confidence in my abilities.

I can probably count the number of friends I have on one hand, and only one of them is close, which is a stark contrast to the big friend groups I often see among my peers that do everything together, from working on psets to hanging out and traveling. Some of my friends can also be quite judgmental and elitist so I don't share my thoughts with them about these things. I was in a shitty emotionally abusive LDR for the first two years and I buried myself in my dorm all the time from pretty much all social interaction. I eat most meals alone and struggle to make deep emotional connections with anyone, even after I joined an eating club.

With a year left, I have been thinking about a bucket list for my senior year and how to squeeze the most out of my time here, but realistically, I was floating around for the past three years. There are experiences here that I will treasure for the rest of my life, but I see much of my time here painted in a negative light. I hate myself for making uninformed decisions, not taking care of myself, not making the most out of all the resources and experiences Princeton has to offer to its privileged undergraduates. I apologize if this is the wrong place to post about this, but I wanted to share these feelings with the Princeton community, and wonder if anyone else had a less than idyllic time here.

Do y’all think it’s doable to live there, commute, shop without a car, using only public transport and/or a bike ?

Called Financial Aid office who directed me to calling Student Health Plan Office (obvious now), went to voice mail but they responded to my email in a couple of hours. My medicaid insurance they said won't qualify for the opt-out option for Princeton insurance, however if I am on financial aid I can simply submit the form stating that my plan does not meet the requires and to opt-in, FA will be notified in July and they'll update my financial aid to cover it before fall semester billing.

I am looking for someone interested in trading for my confusingly named 3-room double in Walker Hall. This means there are two single bedrooms attached to a shared common room — room 221 in the attached floor plan.

The main benefit to this place is that Walker Hall is very centrally located on campus, just a 4-minute walk from the Frist Campus Center, for example. The room setup with the common room is pretty sweet too.

I'm hoping to switch so that I can be better integrated with grad student social life (I tend to isolate myself if barriers to socializing are too high).

If you are someone in the GC or annexes who might be interested, dm me! I'd also trade with someone in an apartment, though I doubt if anyone would want that. Also, if anyone on this sub knows of other venues where I can seek out this kind of trade, let me know.

* **Rocky/Mathey (Roma)**: probably what you think of when you hear princeton
   * **Pros**: Good food, great merch (Mathey moose!), best location (upcampus), high sense of community
   * **Cons**: Housing sucks. No air conditioning. Bathrooms are dingy. Laundry requires you to step outside. Dining hall requires you to step outside. Some rooms don't have windows. It's musty.
   * **Tier:** C
* **Whitman**: like roma but better and punted to the side
   * **Pros**: Architecture is cool. Air conditioning. The onion (dining hall extension). Spatious rooms. Chicken pot pie on Wednesdays. Big open grass fields for spikeball, etc.
   * **Cons**: It's kind of boring. The onion (dining hall extension). Food is subpar on most days, but at least you have a dining hall still.
   * **Tier:** B
* **Butler**: me when you pull up to the super-8 motel
   * **Pros**: Air conditioning. Brick (if you're into brick). Has its own convenience store (studio 34).
   * **Cons**: Brick (if you're not into brick). No dining hall (you must walk to Whitman or NCW). South side of campus (away from everything). Lower sense of community (study spots are secluded).
   * **Tier:** B
* **New Colleges (NCW / Yeh)**: right next to the super-8 is a holiday inn
   * **Pros**: Air conditioning. Rooms are huge (especially the doubles). Furniture is ridiculously expensive Scandinavian stuff (500 dollars per stool LOL). Lounges are open and big. Dining hall is connected underground to every dorm building (don't have to walk outside in the cold). Best dining hall by a mile. Fox mascot.
   * **Cons**: Bottommost edge of campus (unless you like walking). Holiday inn construction means it doesn't feel as homey (title goes to Forbes probably). Construction was rushed so some things break randomly. Dining hall is always crowded.
   * **Tier**: A
* **Forbes**: this one's actually a hotel
   * **Pros**: Sunday brunch. Dining hall is quite good usually. Funded by *the* Forbes (or at least closely related I think). Was at one point a hotel. Very high sense of community because...
   * **Cons**: You're stuck in Brazil. Walking anywhere except Wawa will make you want to punt the nearest squirrel. Annex has no air conditioning (good luck!). You will either be constantly in Forbes or never in Forbes.

I’m not a student, but a local author who grew up in the area and visited often. I’m currently publishing a fiction book that partially takes place on campus. Since I’ve never been enrolled, I’ve never been able to see the inside of the buildings, therefore I’m having some difficulty writing accurate scenes. I’ve tried to research most of these, but it’s hard to find this specific information. 

Is anyone willing to answer some very random, yet specific questions for me?

- How late are academic buildings open during the week? Do they “close down” once classes are done and shut off all the lights after a certain time?

- How late do classes normally run? When I was in college, I had a class that was 6pm-8pm, so I’m wondering if Princeton has late night classes like that. 

- Do professors host office hours? If so, how late would they normally be available?

- What does the interior of East Pyne Hall look like? Has it been remodeled in a modern way, or has it retained historical features and decor (dark wood walls, etc). Is there a movie or TV show that accurately depicts this building that I can reference?

- If I was to visit campus when class is not in session (such as during summer), would any academic buildings be open/unlocked for me to go inside to look? I would only be interested in taking a few reference photos for research purposes. Or could I reach out to the school and request a private tour?

- Are students allowed to request to stay in their dorms over winter break (if there is a specific reason like international students or other special circumstances)?

- I’ve done research about the Eating Clubs, and they seem very interesting! Do they also host parties here that might be similar to a typical college party?

Thanks in advance to anyone who answers! Also if you’re willing to chat more, let me know if you’re open to a private conversation.  I might have more random questions come up in the future.

I am a student at a liberal arts school and a while back (when I was in freshman year of high school) I stumbled upon some documents from a supreme court justice who attended Princeton during his undergraduate studies. This was after he died. I put them away somewhere semi-safe (as safe as I can do). Now that I am back home from college for the summer, I took them back out after years of having them and went through them all. These documents are mostly his school notes, and as fun and interesting as they are (for example his numerous silly drawings in the margins) they were not what interested me. 

There are numerous papers of psets, exams, syllabi, and comps, all from Princeton. There are also class schedules and the like. They are all from 1949-1953 and are almost all related to the Cold War, classics, law, and political science. Do you think the Princeton archives or library or whatnot would be interested in preserving them? If so I’d be happy to send them in; an institution has far greater capabilities to keep documents safe than some random individual. The school I attend regularly preserves documents of similar sorts.

Princeton vs Wharton,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1d915z7/princeton_vs_wharton/,11,31,2024-06-05 21:17:54,"Hey all. I was admitted to Princeton for Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE) and Penn's Wharton School for Statistics (or I can switch to finance), and I am having trouble deciding between the two. The financial aid packages are comparable, but Princeton is 3k less.

I think ORFE is a combination of data science and statistics, and maybe math and computer science. My understanding of it is like a more technical and quantitative ""business"" major. Wharton on the other hand is just pure business. Now, Penn's dual degree program is extremely appealing to me (I'm thinking about doing CS and stat/finance) while Princeton does not even allow double major. However, I am a bit concerned about Penn's cut throat environment. It also seems that Princeton is more rigorous academically than Wharton so I will probably have less free time outside of studying.

What are your thoughts? Which school will provide me with the most opportunities in terms of career, internships, and earnings? Thanks."

Now I’m a conservative from a Republican family, but I’m not too vocal about my political views and I’m not a supporter of the mainstream Republican Party (think Donald Trump and his followers), but it is part of my identity.

I understand that Princeton, like most Ivies and top schools, is a fairly liberal institution with a more left-leaning student body (which is expected and I’m totally fine with).

Just wanted to know if there is a widespread acceptance of differing political views at Princeton, or should I keep that to myself? "

Anyhow, I'm facing a college decision between here, John's Hopkins, UChicago and Berkeley. This is definitely not a decision I ever expected to face but the opportunities are now clear. The medical school dream pivoted and I chose Chemistry/Chemical Biolgy everywhere, perhaps a double Materials Engineering & Statistcs minor. Hope to delve further into Bio-Materials Theory and research, a PhD in Chemistry, one day work deep into the commercialization and entrepreneurship of (Nano)materials in health/medical applications. 

I do think I've narrowed it down to here and Berkeley, I live in California so Berkeley would be the only college I can visit next week. What can I expect in terms of research, internships opportunities? But also social opportunities to just connect and develop lasting relationships with my new peers. A bit timid I won't have enough time given the 2 year window, which is where I feel Berkeley is much more transfer-friendly and understanding, but my foresight could be short-sighted in that context.

We demand PGSU denounce antisemitism,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cpzg8w,81,26,2024-05-12 04:17:03,"We write this as your fellow graduate students with a range of views on unionization, from being against the current unionization efforts to being involved as organizers. We are increasingly worried as we approach the unionization vote. We feel we can only voice our concerns anonymously due to the climate PGSU has created by targeting individuals in a hostile manner.

We are troubled by the antisemitism and hate speech within PGSU and demand they publicly denounce this rhetoric and commit to supporting Jewish students.

A few months ago, a message in the graduate student Slack contained several anti-Semitic statements such as “Jews have naturally developed something of a victim complex” and received 29 positive reactions, including bullseyes and hearts from union organizers. We were appalled and concerned, especially as some of these people could represent us in future negotiations and actions.

One of the main campus protest organizers, who also leads PGSU, has made posts that we find inappropriate for our community, including support for Hamas, calls for the fall of the American empire, and calls for violence.

These are just two examples of many we’ve seen. We’ve removed identifying information from the supporting images to protect individuals’ safety. We believe PGSU has a responsibility to break their silence and clarify what rhetoric is acceptable.

A Message From Concerned Jewish Students to PGSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1cpie5a/a_message_from_concerned_jewish_students_to_pgsu/,108,46,2024-05-11 14:12:05," We are graduate students writing this with an increasing amount of concern in the days before the graduate student election to unionize, where we may enter a commitment to be represented by both local organizers and national representatives. In the past few days, we have seen pro-union students tear down posters across campus with anti-union sentiments, organizers target individuals at their homes to convince them to vote ""yes,"" remove those they think will vote ""no"" from their communications, and above all, refuse to put out any statements or answer any questions in any public forum outside of in-person 1-on-1 conversations. All of this has been part of a campaign where they have tracked the likelihood that individual students will lean ""yes"" or ""no"" on the vote along with personal email and home addresses that are available to essentially anybody who wants access. Some of us are against unionizing with UE, some of us are neutral, and some of us are even union organizers. We have differing opinions on Israel. All of us feel that we can only bring these concerns forward anonymously because of the environment PGSU has created.

PGSU is plagued with antisemitism and hate speech, and we demand that PGSU not be silent on this issue. **We demand that PGSU publicly condemn antisemitism and anti-American rhetoric and commit to supporting Jewish students.**

Several months ago, a Slack message in the graduate student Slack channel containing several highly anti-Semitic statements including [""Jews have naturally developed something of a victim complex""](https://imgur.com/6Se6TFk) got 29 positive reactions, including several ""heart"" and ""bullseye"" reacts from union organizers. When we saw this, we were disgusted that anybody would write such a thing, much less that dozens of our colleagues would react so positively. Our disgust turned to concern when we realized that some of those who felt publicly comfortable supporting these views were students who would likely represent us in negotiations, disputes, and even political action.

One of the lead organizers for the protests on campus is also a lead organizer for PGSU. We have been concerned with the level of involvement of this person for a long time and their comfort with rhetoric that has no place at Princeton. These posts include pictures of [bulldozers](https://imgur.com/DNg22KI) and [statements of support](https://imgur.com/Ll1pZ9q) for Hamas reposted on October 7, a picture of the [American flag](https://imgur.com/zYm76S3) on the White House taken personally by this individual with the caption ""may this empire fall so swiftly, so so swiftly,"" a [picture of President Biden](https://imgur.com/fUS0yTb) with the caption ""may this empire fall so swiftly, may all of its upholders suffer infinite consequences,"" and calls to [bomb shipments](https://imgur.com/NR6FVLG).

These are just two examples of many more that we have seen. We have removed as much identifying information as we could from these images because our intent is not to single students out or risk their safety by spreading their information. We use these examples only to show that PGSU has a responsibility to break their silence and take a stand on what is and is not acceptable rhetoric.

Is the fearmongering surrounding Princeton merited?,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1cpqex2/is_the_fearmongering_surrounding_princeton_merited/,31,37,2024-05-11 20:27:53,"I've committed to Princeton in the fall, and as I've begun researching more into what programs and classes I may want to pursue I've been rather unsettled by the sheer amount of videos, articles and posts that collectively claim that if I value my mental health and happiness I should never, under any circumstance, come to this school. And while yes there are also plenty of positive reports out there on the school, I can't help but feel the negative ones outnumber their counterparts, and seem especially more terrifying than the positive ones seem exciting.

Is this something I should genuinely be concerned about? Are the students truly snakey and cutthroat beyond redemption? Are the academics so difficult and hustle culture so acute that I'm doomed to live miserably for four years? Or am I giving too much weight to those with bad experiences?

Thanks in advance for any input.

As soon as I got into Princeton, I was fully ready to commit, but surprisingly, I was also accepted into Stanford! 

**Financial Aid:**

Stanford – It seems I will be paying out of pocket $14k a year

Princeton – I haven’t received my Fin Aid package yet, but it seems to be totally 100% free

**Student Life:**

Stanford – It seems like everyone on campus is cool with eachother

Princeton – More clicks, eating clubs, etc.

**Degree:**

Stanford – MS&E/Economics

Princeton – Economics/Finance cert

**Career:**

I want to break into Investment Banking, and have a career in Finance.

Potential entrepreneurship. 

**Major Question and final remarks:**

Which one will be better for my career field in Investment Banking/Finance? Where will I potentially feel happier without regret of choosing one over the other? Who's been in a similar situation? I know Princeton location is a huge plus, especially with the banking in NYC.

I feel I’d still be able to break in IB with Stanford, but would be at a disadvantage with location. But I've been itching to go to Stanford for a while. 

**PSS:**

I’ve been wanting to move to California for years, I YEARN for the weather, I do get seasonal depression, nothing bad at all, but the warm weather makes me happy.

Also to note, I am a Military Veteran, I believe the culture at Stanford might be better since I’m the 7^(th) Princeton Cohort since they brought back transfers.

Harvard vs Princeton for Rocket Science,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1ccum9s/harvard_vs_princeton_for_rocket_science/,7,7,2024-04-25 15:19:19,"Hello, I've been lucky enough to be accepted to both Harvard and Princeton for engineering and am still having trouble picking which one is right for me. On one hand, Princeton has a Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Program and has the largest endowment-to-student ratio. However, Harvard has MIT cross-registering and I get the benefit of the Harvard name(I don't know how much this actually helps).

I don't know what field of aerospace I want to go in but I am interested in the intersections of it with microbiology and journalism.

I went to Visitas and Princeton Preview, but that just made the decision more difficult. I could see myself at both Princeton and Harvard. To me, the urban and college-city distinction doesn't mean much. They do give different vibes and Princeton is slightly better for me.

I liked Princeton’s campus wayyy more than MIT, and I definitely want to go to MIT for grad school (but not be there for 8-10 years). My heart is telling me Princeton, but I need to know honestly how the experience is (in general and for engineering students).

ECE majors and engineering students: 

1.) Is the program cutthroat competitive, or more collaborative?

2.) How good is the grad school placement? (I have heard that it’s much easier to funnel into MIT for grad if you are also an undergrad) 

3.) Are the professors nice and eager to work with undergrads? 

4.) Thoughts on the quality of research opportunities/connections? Is it comparable to MIT?

5.) Is grade deflation still really bad?


Student Body in General:

1.) I saw a YT video that basically said “DONT COME HERE EVERYONE IS TOXIC”…so are people at Princeton actually super toxic?

2.) Are there lots of manifestations of elitism and social stratification? I really don’t want to worrying about losing out on social life/connections because of freaking popularity in college (eating clubs)

3.) How do you feel about the sense of culture at Princeton, and is it hard to “fit in”? 

4.) Why did you choose Princeton, and/or do you have any regrets about coming to PTon? Would you change your decision if you could?

5.) How are the mental health resources? (I will need good counselors to help me sort out issues I haven’t been able to address at home)

6.) (Less important to an extent) How is the dating scene, specifically for queer students? 

And pls lmk about anything you love or hate regarding the school :,)

By no means am I trying to sound less appreciative of the opportunities that I have, but I’m so confused on what to choose at this point. I’m first generation and my parents are sweet, but not the greatest when it comes to helping pick colleges. 

For context, I’m planning on majoring in engineering (CBE at Princeton, BME at Yale, or MENG with Bio concentration at UChicago) on the pre-medical track. My main focus is pre-med, so I am not really focused on prestige. I also got similar financial aid offers from each school and am in the process of appealing. 

I feel really scared that I’ll mess up and won’t succeed because of any mistake that I make. I feel that I’m not up to par with so many other students that have done such amazing things and are already miles ahead in terms of academics due to coming from a rural public school. 

Princeton Pros:

* stronger in STEM 
* more undergraduate research opportunities
* great undergraduate focus
* one of the best engineering departments in the world
* great alumni network
* beautiful and safe campus

&#x200B;

Princeton Cons:

* grade deflation (as a pre-med major I heard that GPA is a big concern when applying)
* students seem to be more stressed out about grades
* not as many premed opportunities
* eating clubs give me an off vibe
* secluded campus

&#x200B;

Yale Pros:

* great for premeds (lots of opportunities to volunteer and shadow)
* access to town and transportation 
* happier student body? more relaxed and collaborative
* grade inflation (good for med-schools and less stress for grades despite similar academic rigor)
* residential college system has better community
* great interdisciplinary approach

&#x200B;

Yale Cons:

* weaker in STEM areas, esp engineering
* heard a lot of bad things about New Haven
* not as big alumni network
* equal graduate and undergraduate populations
* not as many opportunities for research

&#x200B;

UChicago Pros

* great interdisciplinary approach to learning through CORE
* good access to opportunities within Chicago
* has medical school on campus 
* friendly faculty 
* pre-med advising I’ve heard to be pretty great

&#x200B;

UChicago Cons

* grade deflation or lack of inflation
* Hyde park is not the best for students
* little bit more expensive than the other two
* MENG is relatively new
* uchicago is where fun goes to die T-T
* terrible weather
* relatively more humanities focus? has been focused on STEM in recent years 

Everyone is saying to just go with whichever one feels better, but they all are so amazing in my opinion and have their own pros and cons that make them less or more favorable. 

I don’t know where to commit right now and find myself switching schools every other day and overthinking about everything.

To current students, current premeds, and anyone available, why did you choose Princeton? Why should I?

I'm hoping that what they have said isn't true because these were quite elitist statements and really threw me off coming from my friends. however over time i have spoken to a few more people inside and outside of the math department who share this sentiment.

Saw several posts/comments stressing Princeton’s undergrad focus, but wanted some insight into what that would mean for a PhD student here.

I’m currently deciding between Princeton and a couple other schools that are the more stereotypical graduate and professional powerhouses (going for STEM PhD, these places have more grad students than undergrad, which apparently is a serious factor to consider).

My undergrad is also known for being one of these undergrad education-focused schools, also in a suburban/rural area with not much to do outside of campus. I’ve been able to get to know the PhD students in my department pretty well, and they say that, although the undergrad presence is definitely stronger, they didn’t feel that it negatively impacted them in any way or detracted from their experience.

This seems to be a slightly bigger deal here, so I wanted to know-do grad students feel that there are things that seriously take away from their time here because of this, or is it just a thing where life seems a little worse by comparison.

I was actually impressed by the smaller enrollment numbers (thought that would mean more resources to go around) and the push for undergrads to pursue research, which I see as generally a good thing for everyone involved.

Any thoughts are appreciated, from grad or undergrad students! "

Questions for Past and Current SPIA Majors!! ,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1bv4gd2/questions_for_past_and_current_spia_majors/,5,2,2024-04-03 21:12:10,"Hello, I’m an incoming freshman with a few questions about SPIA. I’d say I’ve done some pretty extensive research on the major, but I’d also like to get the opinion of people who have actually been through it: 

1. I’ve obviously heard about Princeton’s notorious grade deflation, but I’ve also heard that SPIA is considered an “easy” major, with one redditor on here even calling it a joke. So how would you say the rigor is?

2. I’ve seen some people advise potential SPIA majors to pursue other options (like Politics) because SPIA is pretty rigid in its structure and doesn’t really allow for as much exploration as other majors. Is that true in your experience?

3. For new SPIA graduates or current students who have found success (or have struggled) in securing internships, how would you say job placement is and career support within the major specifically? How far has the Princeton name, and the connections that come with it, gotten you in trying to start a career?

Edit:

4. This may be niche, but for those of you who made the switch from SPIA to Politics (the two I’m considering) or vice versa, please answer #3 and also tell me why you did so."
help me choose between Princeton and columbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1bvcjpc/help_me_choose_between_princeton_and_columbia/,0,20,2024-04-04 02:59:10,"Hello,

I recently got into these colleges, with full rides (so money is not an issue thankfully), besides some other ones too:

Columbia (likely letter, but weirdly not invited to scholar's program)

Princeton, which was number 1 on us news and world report this yr

Duke

Cornell

Johns Hopkins University (hodson or whatever it's called (forgot its name lol) scholars program (only 10 or 20 students get it)

UCLA

WashU

Middlebury

Amherst College

Stanford

Emory

Rutgers NB Honors College w/ 15k a year and could graduate with BS in a year and half due to my college credits)

Boston College

Vassar College

I know I am lucky to get into these schools, but I have a couple of questions. I appreciate any input from anyone, especially those who have attended Princeton or Columbia, since I am hoping to commute and those are closest to where I live.

* I am planning on doing pre-med, and hope to attend NYU grossman school or med, icahn school of med/mount sinai, or einstein med school. I want to attend a college where getting a good GPA (preferably 3.7+) will be not easy, but doable. I also am leaning mostly towards Columbia, but I have heard so many bad things about it. Like I've heard that the environment is incredibly toxic, there are only a few A's given out per class, and the competition is not so friendly. I like competition, just friendly competition. I also want to enjoy my college years and want to be happy, not over stressed. Also, I was not invited to the scholar's program, despite getting a likely letter, and this is making me gravitate more towards Princeton. But, Princeton also doesn't have a plain BIO major, and the closest thing is molecular and cellular bio, which would probably be harder than a plain bio major. I have almost 2 years worth of college credits from dual enrollment, and ideally speaking, I would love to graduate with my bachelor's faster and move on to med school, so which college would take most of my credits? Also, I really don't like Columbia's core curriculum, especially as a pre-med student. I want to focus on the science courses and feel like those classes will be a waste of time, especially because english/philosophy/social science courses tend to be subjective and entirely up to the professor. Which brings me to another very important question: are the columbia professors generally nice? I've heard some bad things about their grading systems too, so any input from students there would be greatly appreciated. What about Princeton profs?

I'd appreciate it if anyone could help me make my decision between columbia and princeton for premed. Also, does one of these colleges have a higher acceptance rate for med schools? Anything related to student life, academics, the environment, etc."

third: princeton obviously has a rigorous curriculum, and i’m excited for the challenge. in your experience, does the study-fun balance meet your preference? 

fourth: do people care about sports? my family is a massive indiana university sports fan, and my literal only qualm with going to princeton is that they don’t have FBS football that i can cheer on (which is extremely knit-picky, princeton is perfect for me!) do students show out to the games at PU? 

final: where can i buy some merch? i have found the PU store, is there any others?

thank you for your time!"

Extremely fortunately, I was recently accepted into Princeton Chemical and Biological Engineering as well as Cornell Biomedical Engineering. For context, I am interested in pursuing a physician career in the future. I am really torn between the two at the moment. On one hand Cornell's engineering program is phenomenal and on the other hand so is Princeton's, I'm finding it slightly hard to find what program would be better, especially considering the future career I am interested in. I live in the Philly area so Princeton will allow me to be only about an hour from family which I value a lot and with Cornell being completely isolated from everything it deters me from Cornell. However, Cornell also gave me a way more generous financial aid package, 3.5k compared to 21k for Princeton. The cost difference is probably the biggest factor currently keeping me on the fence. Would it be possible to for Princeton somewhat match Cornell or at least increase grant aid? Could I write a letter to the financial aid office explaining the situation, is it possible for them to budge at all? I was surprised because Princeton's aid package was was smaller compared to other universities I have been admitted to. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you!"

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”   

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept  cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in  front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I  heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Butterfingers in his hands without paying.   

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and  was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept  pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back  around and brought them to the counter.   

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to  prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and  put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.   "

Graduate student housing,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1avzzut/graduate_student_housing/,4,8,2024-02-21 02:03:27,"Hello,

TL;DR: How hard is it to get to live in an apartment with a kitchen and no meal plan as a first year grad student?

I am a recently admitted mathematics PhD student. I absolutely despised my undergraduate dining hall food and I do not want to go back to university dining halls, so I want to make sure I (a) do not have to be on a meal plan so that I am not throwing money away, and (b) have access to a kitchen, preferably not shared with a large group (I've seen how nasty some people can be about not cleaning up after they cook...).

It seems like getting a studio at Lawrence would be the most attractive to me, but how likely is that as a first year student? If I don't get a good offer form student housing, is it easy to find apartments near campus? I have a bicycle but don't own a car and don't know how to drive.

Princeton is probably my top choice for graduate school right now, but in terms of quality of life if I have to eat dining hall food again for another year I don't think I'll survive...

Incoming grad student housing confusion!,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1aus2lf/incoming_grad_student_housing_confusion/,6,4,2024-02-19 16:53:13,"Hi everyone! I am an international student, and have recently been accepted to the graduate school at Princeton (no, I still cannot believe it), and I've accepted the offer. I am super excited! I was confused about some aspects of the housing situation and I would really appreciate someone helping me with them.

I found out that all incoming first year grad students are housed in either the graduate colleges or the annexes. The graduate college requires me to purchase a meal plan, while the annexe does not. So these are my queries:

1. While I am no stranger to living in dorms having done that during the whole course of my undergrad, what I am concerned with are the meal plans. Since I am not American, something which I call comfort food is very different from the menus of the dining hall in the graduate college, and after a long, hard day at work, I definitely want to be able to eat something I find comforting. I would be moving halfway across the world to attend Princeton, and I was looking forward to cooking my own food, and staying connected with my family, culture, and country in the process. Although the graduate college has kitchens, I would still be paying for the meal plans and I feel like if I cook and pay for the meal plans that would be an unnecessary waste of money. I was wondering if this thought process sounds reasonable.


2. This brings me to my second point. If I don't want a meal plan, I should be staying in the annexe. I wanted to know what are the chances that I get assigned a room in the annexe in my first year? Also, if I don't have a car, how accessible are the grocery stores nearby campus?


3. Is there something I am completely ignoring while thinking about this whole thing? Are there any important advantages to living in the graduate college with a meal plan that I should consider before making a decision? Are there any other aspects apart from the meal issue I should consider? Also, if I end up not getting a meal plan, would I be allowed to eat any meals in the dining halls (even if I have to pay for it separately) for example, on the weekends? 

Sorry for the long post! This whole process is very overwhelming, especially for international students! Would really appreciate any insights. TIA!! "

My math story related to Princeton University,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1agu9q6/my_math_story_related_to_princeton_university/,3,12,2024-02-02 03:37:56," 

When I was in middle school and high school, my passion was mathematics. I was hating something that's called math, and in my high school orientation, I chose literature to get far from math. Even in the literature, I was not getting good grades at math because I'm not interested at all in numbers because I heard just the numbers, and when I asked the teacher about something in math, he told me to just apply the rule that I give you—don't try to think. I never attend a teacher class, and I ask him or her about math, and they always say math is the numbers 1+1 = 2 and a circle is 360 and a triangle is 180. But no one told me that math is essential to our lives, from the table at which you are sitting down as a student to rocks, tanks, etc. I believe the quote that ***Richard Feynman said: “If you find science boring, you are learning it from the wrong teacher.”*** This is exactly what’s happened to me.

I don't know what mathematics is, and I don’t know where we can apply the concepts of math in the real world, so it’s become boring to me when I know what math is until I get my baccalaureate degree. After that, I chose a private school to study computer science. Why a private school? because in my country you can’t choose an engineering field if you study literature, so I struggled to find a school that taught Cs and not math, but when I dug deep into searches for Cs like data science, AI,... I found that without math, you can’t do anything and you will start just dreaming, so I felt frustrated and said to myself, I cannot learn mathematics when I am 19 years old. It is too late. and the other side of me said no, you can do it, so I started watching videos about what the road map is to studying math.

I dig deep and deep and deep. I found some guys who also learned mathematics late in their lives, and when I started learning mathematics, I didn’t start studying in my mother tongue. No, I’m studying mathematics in English, so I started like I didn’t know anything about math, so I started first with arithmetic, and then I moved on to algebra 1. Let me tell you something that is really important in my country. In our educational system, we depend on the French school. Trust me, I hate that system. When I’m studying in the American system, I feel more comfortable. I love hearing the numbers one, two, square root, raise to x, and then hearing math like that: un, deux, three, racine carrée. Anyway, I start reading mathematics books, take courses, and join math communities. Even the movies that I start watching relate to math, like 21 and Beautiful Mind, and one of the main factors that made me obsessed with Princeton my whole life was math, still until the moment that I write this post.

I know I have something that I’m passing about, which is numbers, and now I know the value of math, and I know that without math, you can’t do a simple task like turn on the light because, as normal, we see just that you will press the button and the light will turn on, but we don't know what’s happened behind the scenes, and we don’t know that there is a lot of math and physics occurring over there. As I almost finish my first year at the private school, I start thinking about studying because I know I will not have the opportunity to study science in my country with a high school literature degree.

I started searching for countries, and my filter was to choose countries based on two things: good quality education at a cheap price, and the first country that comes to mind is the USA. As I said, I was watching math movies, and it was a prestigious university that is mentioned, like Princeton John Nash, 21 Harvard, and a lot of movies. I was loving America very much. But the USA has a good quality of education, but it’s really expensive, and my family can’t afford that. Even if I apply for a scholarship, I have to have a solid profile and take the SAT. And at the moment, I am still just learning math, and even now, there is no end to math. After that, I saw a country that provides a good education with low tuition fees and cheap living expenses, and this country is China. Oh, I forgot the program-taught in English, so I chose a university in China, and they gave me a scholarship that covered my tuition fees.

Now I’m in China, and I have a good program. I study math every day. Actually, I’m struggling because I just finished my algebra 1 and I'm studying geometry 1, but in our program there is calculus 1, so I have to study the math for myself and also have to meet the expectations of our program because you can’t study calculus and you don’t have knowledge in algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. At least the basics of each course because math is an accumulation lesson based on lesson and calculus collects all the courses. I feel that I’m making progress. My knowledge now is not the same as it was 5 months ago because, as I said, my whole life is math, and I spend usually over 8 hours a day studying math like I’m majoring in it. Hahaha, because I have a new goal, which is to attend Princeton University for a master's degree in mathematics. I love this university so much, so I have to meet their admission requirements, and the first one I focus on now is my GPA. This is my first year, by the way. I don’t want to study in the USA. I want to study at Princeton to be like John Nash or Einstein, who used to teach over there. You might think that I’m stupid, and you will say Princeton in the USA.

I know that, but what I want to say is that to choose the USA as a destination to study, you will have a list of universities in the USA, but in terms of me, I have just one, which is Princeton. The word that I will say now—maybe you will think that is funny—will express what is on my inside. I just finished my first semester, and I always go to Google as a search query: “Does Princeton University offer a full-funded scholarship for master's international students?"" or “What is the GPA to get into Princeton?"" I watched a video that said that you can afford your tuition fees and living expenses with TA/RA. The best way to do this is to contact the professors to offer you this position. Imagine that I enter the Princeton math department website and start searching for the professors, even though this is my first year in the undergraduate program."

"Orange may not be your fave, but this Princeton interview made it mine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/1aczvlw/orange_may_not_be_your_fave_but_this_princeton/,14,15,2024-01-28 10:34:20,"Don't get me wrong, Ivy Leagues are an amazing set of schools. Most people who apply to one, apply to the rest as well. I totally did the same because rejection is more than likely. I am delusional in believing that the more schools I apply to the less rejection I will face. Concerning - Yes. Anyways, Harvard was my top Ivy because I went there for the summer on scholarship and had the best time in my life. I met the best girllllsss ever and honestly felt my identity develop within the context of a Harvard Community. I applied REA, did not get an interview, and you guessed it....... got deferred.

Then this last Sunday I got an email about an interview and was completely ecstatic. Now the interview was good, but I could not really read the interviewer. We did laugh, exchange books and plays. We ended up having a lot in common and after the interview I felt like I did decent like good. Then again I could not tell because he really was strict to the time of 55 or 45 minutes. It was nice though to learn more about  how Harvard changes lives.

I hope I get in anyways........

Now today I had my Princeton interview and it was life changing. The interview was set up in a law firm building within my city. They had a bunch of Princeton decorations and the staff working the entrance and welcoming students were so sweet. I always thought that Princeton was this snobby school, but the sense I got from just doing an interview was immaculate. My interviewer was a personality and I enjoyed every minute talking to them. We had a lot in common including our views about leadership. They told me that they were going to be my biggest advocate and really wanted to help write my story. I learned so much about the community at Princeton. It is one of the colleges that have the most people attending their reunions and alum donating because they seriously loved the school. My interview started at around 11:57 and ended at 1:11 I believe. We were the last people to finish despite people being interviewed earlier and later than me. I just was really happy with the conversation. I truly do not have amazing ACT scores, but for a second in that interview Princeton became my home and school. Hopefully I get in, I just really hope soo!!

Anyways here are my amazing tips for interviews!

ps. I am trying to help, but I have not got accepted yet, totally will update you guys.

1. STOP I mean it. STOP watching the youtube videos about college interviews. Now if you truly do not know how to formulate answers about yourself then watch them, but try to stay away from them. I find that it takes your personality and informality out of the interview. The way you answer a question should be true to you. When I was in my Princeton interview, they asked me how Princeton got on my radar. My answer ultimately linked to the community that I saw through youtube vlogs and videos. They said that people typically answer about their majors and you knowww whyyy..... because of those college interview videos. They tell you to always talk about your major. I find that if you focus on your values as a person, every piece of you will connect to show a bigger picture.
2. You can never fully prepare for an interview. I know you were reading this expecting to find questions or something. It is the truth though, you just cannot prepare. These interviews are based on your initial connection with the alumni and their personality traits. That is why the interview does not hold a lot of weight on our admission to the college. The questions they ask you are connected to how you answered their previous questions. Now I have read about the horrible ones where they made them perform math in front of them and grilled world history, but come in with positive energy. Most to almost all interviewers are here with the intention of being your advocate. They are looking for your positive attributes, so do not worry about stuttering or silence. Be yourself (the youtube people tell you not to be, I tell you to be). I believe the best interviews, according to Yale, are the ones that feel like a conversation not a question and answer. Please do not panic the night before, you will do amazing.
3. Now I know I said you cannot prepare, but here is something that will help you. The only things you really need to have are very intriguing questions ready for your interviewer and the specific reasons why the school. The night before my interviews I would do in depth research about the ways the schools would support me to excel and wrote it down. Then I would think about unique questions that focused on their experience at Princeton. I carried that notebook to the interview so I had a point of reference, but I did not end up needing it, because the conversation was amazing. When I started asking questions they treated it like a game show, which really made me happy to see them engaged. If you know your why and its genuine you will be fine. Make sure to have a mixture of clubs, projects, or events that make you interested in the school.
4. Arrive an hour early. Now this was amazing because I became comfortable in my environment and could chill down because I was internally crying from anxiety. Being in the area that you may have your interview really keeps you familiar and slightly comfortable. It is also amazing to text your interviewer and hour early and say I am wearing this because they know you were extremely early. Early is the best option. Also leaving your home within that time frame allows you to use the allotted time, if needed, for panicking because your gps is taking you to a macaroni bowl place instead of the free parking garage they sent in the email----- totally did not happen to me.
5. Wear what you are comfortable with. If you feel confident and delicious then you will rock the interview. Do not force yourself to wear something that does not resonate with you. For both of my interviews, I embraced my personality and wore pink with big chunky pink heels. It is me expressed through fashion. I will never wear jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, or sweatshirt to any type of interview. Although some people feel confident in that so rock ittttt.
6. I do not know if taking notes was impressive. It was helpful though for me to jot things down like recommendations or programs I did not know about. Totally recommend bringing a journal and a really quirky pen. Seriously do it because if everything goes to crap at least you looked cute with a quirky pen.
7. Cut the resume and restating your stats. Unless they tell you to bring a resume, do not worry about creating one or coming up with anecdotes. It is a conversation about you. You know what you value and if you don't sit down and journal about what you want your interviewer to know about your values.

For my friends who did not get an interview, you are amazing. Now this is my idea about interviews,  every school is different with their approach. They all say that it is based on availability when it probably has more factors than we think. My friend and I applied to some of the same schools, we got interviews to 2 of the same and then I got Harvard and they had Yale. We live in the same area mind you. When I was deferred it was easy to believe that there was no Harvard alumni committee in the area, but I was very wrong. They had it and later offered me the interview. Yale, I thought they did not have one, yet my friend got it. For some schools, I believe that the people they interview are on the borderline. The students have amazing potential and the admissions wants to hear more about them. The people that were complete acceptances are already admitted and probably not going to be interviewed because they need to utilize their resources for others( sorry for that run on). The students flat out not admitted do not get interviews either because lets be real. Now I am probably wrong because they might view the application with the interview report not before so conspiracy. For other schools, I believe they try to interview everyone. Do not stress about getting an interview, people get accepted all the time who have never been interviewed. Chill and you will be great!!!!!

Love you guys and totally share your stories/tips below. There are going to be a bunch of seniors 8 years from now reading the information, so lets try to help them as much as we can! You guys are going to have a great college season, I am very proud of your work and you!!!!!"

Triangle creates an original mainstage musical every year written, conceived of, and performed by students, directed and choreographed by professionals. The Club boasts a rich history and long list of distinguished alumni including F. Scott Fitzgerald, class of 1917, Jimmy Stewart ‘32, Brooke Shields ‘87, Peter Mills ‘95, Ellie Kemper ‘02 and Catherine Cohen ‘13. This year’s members include over 100 students – writers, composers, marketers, technicians and performers – who come from diverse backgrounds and academic interests but have a shared passion for original musical comedy.

This month, the Princeton Triangle Club will be visiting Maryland (Silver Spring) and Florida (Miami, Palm Beach, Jacksonville) to perform their original musical comedy, ***Ship Happens: A Cruisical!.*** Climb aboard the SS Giznee Fairytale, a cruise with all of the amenities - buffets, shuffleboard, and even magic? While other passengers enjoy their luxurious journey, twins Isla and Lindsay venture below deck, only to be swept away in a current of schemes and whimsy. 

The Triangle Club will also be visiting North Florida (Jacksonville), and New Jersey (West Orange) to perform their ***DING!*** **Show**, a cabaret-style musical revue of Triangle’s greatest hits from its 133-year history and highlights from Ship Happens.

I've always been told since freshman year by upperclassmen that GPAs at Princeton are viewed differently than other grade-inflating schools but the more I compare grad/law/med placements from Princeton undergrads compared to other schools, I'm starting to worry that this isn't the case and if I'm not going to be a department topper at Princeton without also stellar research experience, chances for top programs are rough. It seems like everyone is involved in research heavily too and publications are very hard to come by as an undergrad.

I actually don't know how much the Princeton degree helps here. Any insights?"

Reason for both of these things? Well, I’m just not that level of smart. 

However I was looking into Princeton’s ORFE program and I am fascinated. I am a Mathematical Econ and Data Science major, so this is like my dream Master’s Degree were I to ever get one.

I am currently a software developer and while a lot of my peers are getting their Master’s in CS, I have a feeling a lot of the more applied topics in a CS Master’s program are things I can learn on the job or can learn online.

I also am not set on being a software developer my whole life. I’m also interested in Consulting, Quant finance and possibly a PhD in economics.

The reason ORFE seems like a perfect program for me is that it involves higher level math (which has been my favorite subject in college and I want to learn more), applied programming, and domain knowledge. But unlike a typical MFE degree, I think the added operations research component would be amazing if I chose to pursue consulting or wanted to work in management instead of just becoming a quant.

TL;DR: Are there any graduate programs that combine operations research and financial engineering outside of Princeton? I don’t think I would be accepted to Princeton’s Master’s program but I love the combination of subjects and think it would be a great investment to learn all of them."

From my personal experience, I am more like a classical stereotypical introverted Comp Sci student  (Lmao) interested in rock music and movies; however, it's kinda hard for me to find people with similar interests. 

So I want to create a platform that allows everyone to connect to people who exactly fit their needs. 

Hence, my friends and I implemented an AI on our Discord server, LightUp. It's not like Tinder, Facebook, or any other social media platform. We are different because LightUp has a search engine for people to find friends. In this platform, people can specify their interests, unique thoughts, or some life challenges/struggles they would want to share with others, and the AI we created will find the perfect match for everyone. 

In LightUp, there's no public posting space because we want to keep the conversation private and everyone can decide who they wanna meet. 

Another feature will allow people to write down their thoughts, like a journal and they will receive posts with similar ideas, which means someone who's most likely to understand you. 

We are still working on new features and updates rn for enhancing the user's experience. So we really need some feedback for us to improve!

This was a hard choice, because I was spiritually much more at home at Cornell. Cornell is a much warmer place. It's a real community, partly because of Hans. I mean Hans made it like that, but even without Hans - it's a place which commands enormous loyalty. I mean the friends that we made at Cornell 40 years ago, a lot of them are still there. These people just never leave, including Hans himself, who's now been there for 60 years. And so I felt very much at home there and sort of spiritually I still feel more at home in Ithaca than I do in Princeton. So there were these strong forces keeping me at Cornell. Cornell had always been my vision of America, whereas Princeton is not. Princeton is definitely an alien growth in America. Ithaca is the real thing. So from that point of view I would have preferred to stay in Ithaca, and also I love the people there. 

Obviously he went to both schools at a very different time, but I'm wondering what would have led him to call Princeton an ""alien growth"" and Cornell the ""real thing."" I'm not sure if I've ever thought of either of them being the ""real thing"" in terms of being American or educationally.

Anyone have any insight into this?

I'm sorry, I'm not a student, but I'm currently doing some research on some niche aspects of colleges to narrow down my list.  I was wondering about music lessons at Princeton.

Princeton's music website says that ""Financial assistance is available to all students who are eligible for Princeton [Financial Aid](https://finaid.princeton.edu/). These students will receive a 100% subsidy for lessons,  meaning a confirmed, available set of lessons will come at no cost to these students.""  Does this mean that any Princeton financial-aid-receiver will get a 100% subsidy?  Or does it mean that if you get 60% financial aid, you get a 60% subsidy?

Also, I was wondering if any of you chose to pursue a new instrument at Princeton through lessons.  Would Princeton let you guys just start random instruments?  Or do you have to be in an ensemble/have a super important reason for learning. 

I'm also guessing that Princeton wouldn't give full funds for buying say, a whole saxophone?  lmao

Sorry for the super specific questions!  I was just curious because it seems like Princeton has one of the best financial aid systems for lessons I've seen so far.  Thanks so much!"

Harvard - dated a computer science major from here, he came to my state for an internship at some FAANG company. He was very passable aggressive, and condescending but tried to play it off like he was giving me “advice”. He always wanted to talk about his code but tbh I never gave a shit. Wasn’t a virgin (I was shocked) but was kinda awkward and kept saying he was good in bed. Terrible kisser,  but payed for every meal at dates. Would I date him again? No and I have him blocked 

Cornell - Econ major, really handsome but clearly was a playboy who was not looking for anything serious. Really good at playing the victim, kinda narcissistic but I thought I could fix him. Every hang out involved a bed and he never wanted to go to a restaurant. Was too “busy” to send good morning messages when it was legit the bare minimum. Had a girl best friend who commented on all his posts, had WAAAY too many insta followers and posted way too many selfies. 

UPenn - my favorite 😍😍 10/10 would date this guy again If I could but distance issue. He was hilarious and super creative. Would be the type of guy to say “hey wanna hear something cool?” Instead of texting me “wyd” he had amazing art and literary skills and we would talk for hours about our favorite authors (we had a lot in common) he was sooooo sweet and throughout with his words and honestly biggest green flag of a guy I’ll ever meet (I’m still not over him)

Columbia U - fuck him. He’s a little rat ass bitch who just wanted to hookup and got annoyed when I wouldn’t let him hit. 

Princeton - BIGGEST FUCKING NARCISSIST IVE EVER MET. I’m not even kidding. He gaslighted me so much and would always find a way to blame me for HIS insecurities. (He had money tho 🤑) would offer me to come to his apartment and stay over if I needed, he was always so considerate whenever I’d be sad but idk he gaslit me so much so I feel like it was an emotional tactic 

Yale - okay I really liked him but he was way too busy. Pre med and never had time to hang out so didn’t work out 

Brown university - he was goofy, had a TikTok personality and we got  along really well. I thought he was gay at first tho cause he knew too much about women. He knew what an “everything” shower was. We’re still friends 

I have not dated someone from Dartmouth yet but working on it

I’m a sophomore currently and am not sure how this would work - do I just email the head of the program and see if I get a response? Or is there a more formal process to go through.

We were uncertain about how this reimbursement would work in the end, and I hope this will help someone who wonders what will happen to an external scholarship and a Princeton grant.

My freshman was a recipient of the National Merit Scholarship, which resulted in a reduction of his Princeton grant. Consequently, we sent an official email to the Princeton Financial Aid Office to request the option of applying the reduced grant amount toward a one-time computer purchase. In our case, this involved purchasing a MacBook and an iPad.

After purchasing the MacBook and iPad from Apple store, we provided proof of the purchase, including receipts, credit card transactions, as well as documentation of both the reduced and original financial aid awards. They promptly reimbursed this fund within one week of our request, during the first week of October.

Princeton University is a well-endowed institution, and they are willing to reimburse external scholarship amounts of up to $3,500 toward a computer purchase budget if your Princeton grant is reduced due to an external or outside scholarship.

As members of Princeton’s grad student community, we at Princeton Grad Students United know how difficult it can be to find quality and affordable housing in the area. We have also heard how particularly difficult this process has been on this year’s incoming grad students, particularly due to the University’s insufficient and delayed communication. 

For these reasons, we would love to talk with incoming grad students about their experiences searching for housing, their living situation for the upcoming year, and their opinions on how the process can be improved. PGSU will be hosting a Zoom on *August 15th at 6:00pm EST* in order to discuss housing with incoming grad students, listen to their thoughts on the housing search process, and answer any questions they may have. Please fill out the form listed above so that we can send you a Zoom link to attend. See you soon, and welcome to the Princeton community!"
