Have an admissions question? Look here first!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/ki1f0n/have_an_admissions_question_look_here_first/,78,3,2020-12-22 08:30:25,"Do you have a question about what to write in your application essays? Or about what GPA and test scores are necessary to get in? Maybe you are not applying in the immediate future, but you would like to know what you can do to boost your chances of getting into Caltech.

If these are your questions...**please don't post them here!**

The people on this sub are not admissions officers. They are mostly current students (undergrad and grad) and alums who haven't been through the Caltech admissions process for years. 

**If you would like to discuss admissions with other students going through the process**, please instead go to the following subs:

* /r/applyingtocollege for undergrad admissions
* /r/gradadmissions for grad admissions

Other good tools for answering your questions include the [Caltech admissions website](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/) and [simply Googling](https://google.com) your question. 

On the other hand, **this sub is welcoming to specific, thoughtful, well-researched** questions. Most of us found our time at Caltech to be highly rewarding, and we would love for you to share that experience. **Here are example GOOD admissions questions:** 

* (Undergrad) I am thinking about applying to Caltech, but not sure whether there is a program which suits me. I want to learn about both pure and applied math. I read in the catalog about the math major and the ACM major, however the former seems to pure and the latter seems too applied. Is there a way I can do both?
* (Grad) I want to do research in quantum computing and have heard great things about the Vidick group. Does anyone know whether he is accepting students, and more generally what the research environment in his group is like? I have a chronic illness so I am looking for an advisor who is understanding when I need to take time off. 
* (Either) Does Caltech have an active basketweaving community? On the Caltech club list I found a link to a club website, but it hasn't been updated since 2007.

Edit: This is not a megathread. Please do not comment with bad admissions questions down below -- they will be removed. If you have a good admissions question, please make a separate post and our community of students and alums will be happy to weigh in."
New Subreddit Rule,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/1gl2axc/new_subreddit_rule/,79,1,2024-11-06 16:20:56,"There’s been a lot of low quality admissions posts lately, so I’ve added a new rule (rule 5). The idea is basically: if your question should be 1) googled, 2) emailed to admissions, or 3) posted to r/ApplyingToCollege / r/GradAdmissions, it shouldn’t be posted here.

Let me know if y’all (and by y’all I mean the actual Caltech students/alumni/affiliates on this subreddit) think this rule should be tweaked or removed."
[PSA] USPS Scam Targeting Caltech Students – Fake Anthem Letter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/1gtsjgf/psa_usps_scam_targeting_caltech_students_fake/,23,6,2024-11-18 00:50:58,"Heads up, everyone! I almost got tricked by a scam letter claiming to be from Anthem Blue Cross, targeting students on Student Health Insurance Plans (SHIPs). There is a post from about 5 months on r/scams discussing something super similar: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1dty8dc/headsup\_mail\_from\_anthem\_blue\_cross\_blue\_shield/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1dty8dc/headsup_mail_from_anthem_blue_cross_blue_shield/)

# The Scam:

* Arrives in an **“IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION ENCLOSED”** envelope.
* Claims your info doesn’t match IRS records and asks for your **Social Security Number (SSN)** on a pre-filled form.
* Return address: **P.O. Box 629, Woodland Hills, CA 91365-0629** (not valid anymore).

# Red Flags:

1. **Pressure tactics:** Says it’s overdue and demands a quick reply.
2. **Weird tone/typos:** Looks official but has subtle errors.
3. **Old address:** The PO box was once used by Anthem but isn’t anymore.
4. **Accurate details:** Uses your name, DOB, and Member ID to seem legit.

  
My question to you all: where can I report this at Caltech? I want to let more people know about it so they can spread the word to more students. Thanks!

Caltech parking ticket not showing up on the City of Pasadena website?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/1gt6a36/caltech_parking_ticket_not_showing_up_on_the_city/,1,6,2024-11-17 05:06:39,"I recently got a parking violation in one of the Caltech parking garages for parking without a valid permit(the one for $56).

Faculty comments on athletics in admissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/1gpor34/faculty_comments_on_athletics_in_admissions/,52,47,2024-11-12 16:30:49,"*The California Tech* today has a [recap](https://tech.caltech.edu/2024/11/athletics-admissions-recap/) of an office hours session with the Chair of the Faculty Board, Dean of Undergraduate Students, and Chair of the First Year Admissions committee, on the topic of athletics in admissions (notably absent, it seems, was the Athletics Director). This session is following the faculty's recent realization that more than 25% of undergraduates are *recruited* athletes, and their subsequent decision to reduce athletic recruiting's role in admissions. That series of events was covered by *The Tech* [here](https://tech.caltech.edu/2024/10/08/ug-admissions-athletics/) and in this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/1g0rqk7/more_than_14_of_undergraduates_are_recruited/). 

Some key things from the article: 

* Professor Tamuz stated ""we did give preferential treatment to those who were pushed forward by the coaches. So, if you were somebody that was needed on a team because they needed more people, and you have the role of the pitcher, for example, which is very specialized, this was something that was actively pushed forward in the admissions process."" This process was not implemented by any discussion among the faculty and it was only last year that “the faculty discovered this.”
* A key factor driving the change was the fact that the wider faculty and Faculty Board “had no idea \[increased involvement of athletics in admissions\] was happening.” The increased involvement “sort of happened organically through the bureaucratic creep” and was not decided by the faculty.
* When Professor Refael became Chair of the Faculty Board, he sought to better understand the admissions process, as it is one of the main responsibilities of the faculty. Upon reviewing admissions data, it became clear that Caltech’s admissions were unbalanced. This revelation sparked discussions about admissions priorities, with the goal of realigning the process “to what the faculty believes it should be, which is an admission process that’s based on academic merit and potential.”
* Regarding NCAA eligibility, a school of Caltech’s size requires 10 teams. 
* The Dean of Undergraduate Students said some words about how current student-athletes shouldn't feel bad.

So there we have it. My read on this is the faculty is ultra, ultra mad about this situation. Faculty are generally pretty apathetic, but there is no better way to be the target of their ire than to do something behind their backs. One should note that Professor Refael has taught Ph 1 for many years, so he's not some aloof administrator type; he's at the pointy end of undergraduate education. I'd predict the number of NCAA teams to go from the current 16 to the minimum 10, and be populated by walk ons, as they have since time immemorial. 

This should leave no doubt that recruited athletes have had a huge advantage in admissions. *The composition of the Caltech undergraduate student body was ""actively pushed"" to fill out sports teams.* It cannot be overstated how preposterous the previous sentence sounds to older alumni, and now, finally, faculty. I hope the faculty board continues to keep a close eye on this and oversee a fair and balanced admissions process, ""in the sense that all applicants were considered based on academics."""

Contact for student SciFi library at Caltech?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/1g83k94/contact_for_student_scifi_library_at_caltech/,17,1,2024-10-20 17:07:59,"When my husband was at Caltech back in the early 80s, Ricketts had an extensive SciFi library.

Looking online, it seems to have morphed into SPECTRE and changed locations, and an article from 2019 said the Science Fiction and Fantasy Club was trying to revamp it.

The reason this matters is that my husband has several boxes of SciFi paperbacks that he'd like to donate, but he can't figure out who to contact.

He's tried going through admin for student clubs, and through the alum office, but hasn't gotten anywhere.

Can anyone suggest a direct contact at the SciFi library?

I'm a visiting student for Caltech Up Close, and I'm delighted to be at this school! The people here are so friendly, and everyone I've met is so excited about being CUCed! However, I think that I've been slightly misinformed about some of the fun activities that are possible at Caltech. When talking to the upperclassmen, many suggested that I ""jerk it"" in Kerkhoff (one upperclassman even even talked about his ""peanuts""). However, isn't Jerk the third derivative of position, thus being a physics concept? If so, we should all clearly ""jerk it"" in Downs and Lauritsen. Furthermore, I don't think that any establishments on campus serve ""peanuts"", and I wanted to clarify this.

I love being a CUC on campus, thanks for the great experiences :)"

Caltech Aerospace Engineering Masters Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/1g1ihqw/caltech_aerospace_engineering_masters_questions/,2,2,2024-10-11 19:52:59,"I am looking for masters in Aerospace engineering programs, and naturally Caltech has come up.

I notice it is a one year program instead of the traditional two-year program. They also don’t mention any research requirements.

More than 1/4 of undergraduates are recruited athletes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/1g0rqk7/more_than_14_of_undergraduates_are_recruited/,73,53,2024-10-10 20:01:29,"Some excellent reporting from *The Tech* [here](https://tech.caltech.edu/2024/10/08/ug-admissions-athletics/). Like all bureaucracies, the athletics department grew from recruiting ""very few"" students to over 25%, while the faculty, *who are ultimately responsible for admissions*, slept on it: ""Professor Tamuz \[faculty admissions chair\] stated that this shift towards athletics happened slowly through changes made organically within the system, and the faculty were not really aware of it."" Translated from academic administration-ese, that sounds like ""Athletics behaved like a rogue organization for a decade and purposely hid from faculty oversight.""  

There is a lot of copium from the AD about how athletes do just fine academically, etc., but isn't it a little weird that a dozen or so coaches, hired with little to no faculty or board oversight, selected *over a quarter* of the student body of the most selective school in the country? 

I'd be interested in hearing from current undergraduates about what it's like to have this large proportion of recruited athletes in the student body. 25% is approaching places like Amherst, which exist mainly to populate the LAX bro to investment banking pipeline. Is that what we want? Would current students and alumni agree that ""The positive school spirit that emerges from the 25% of the student body who represent the Institute in competition is a joy to be associated with.""? Is it really the best use of resources for a school that's so cash-strapped it needs to whore itself out in scam bootcamps (see the recent *NY Times* article and coverage in the same issue of *The Tech*). 

I'll also draw parallels to the CTME fiasco here: a rogue group of non-faculty build a little empire within the institute, until one day someone (the faculty, newspapers) wakes up and says ""WTF is going on here?"" The board needs to step up and demand better governance in every dimension. These situations are the ones we outsiders see because they're too big to cover up. Who knows how many petty emperors are making life miserable for students or piling on risks that we can't see? "

This was sort of just a fleeting thought in my mind but I just wanted to get a quick discussion going on its potential feasibility down the road. I'm a current undergraduate at UCLA and while the labs there are plentiful enough, there are a few really niche areas where I can't find any. I was looking into some of the labs at USC and Caltech specifically and saw that they do have ones that encompass those interests.

Is there anything preventing undergrads from cold-emailing/getting into contact with these labs re: research? Are those labs more unlikely to take in undergrads from different institutions? Are there any administrative issues?

Just a bit unsure and looking to get some more insight into that if anyone's tried it before or knows someone who has. Thanks!"

"Dear prefrosh: this school is great, come here (if it's right for you)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/1f1aeh9/dear_prefrosh_this_school_is_great_come_here_if/,86,23,2024-08-25 23:47:22,"I'm a current CS student and I love it here.

- You'll meet brilliant, driven, and interesting people here (and not just STEM people). I vividly remember my first days at Caltech: every time I was pleasantly surprised to bump into someone who shared a niche interest of mine, all the ridiculous discussions and spontaneous shenanigans I was roped into. The novelty has worn off, but every once in a while I feel grateful for how much I take for granted here.

- We have a strong collaborative academic culture. Some of my favorite memories here are of my friends and I sharing that eureka moment at the whiteboard after long hours of debating a proof. Not everyone's idea of fun for sure, but for some it's exactly what we need.

- House culture is awesome, but optional. I've had unforgettable experiences with house trips and projects. But you can make friends regardless of your affiliation. Between the half dozen people in my friend group frosh year, we had members of four different houses, plus someone living in Bechtel. 

- There are some amazing classes and professors. I'm partial to proof-and-project heavy classes that force you to think and do, and Caltech delivers. I've taken a class that pushed me through the grueling proofs and nearly-from-scratch implementations of the most influential machine learning architectures from MLPs to transformers. I've taken a class that just gave me a budget and a broad topic to build any device I wanted. I've taken EE classes that tempted me to become an EE major, and math classes that nearly converted me to math. 

- Like the above, there are many research opportunities for undergraduates both on campus and with labs nearby, and even opportunities to have Caltech fund your personal projects. I've gotten a research position, job opportunities, and a startup grant from Caltech. If you're a prefrosh, you can DM for details.

- Caltech provides unique opportunities for trips off campus. Per 10-week term, I usually average 3 trips to LA, and 1 trip 100+ miles away from campus. The closer ones are escape rooms, stores and restaurants, urbex, movies, hackerthons, the beach. The further ones are skiing and camping, conventions, conferences, and competitions. Some of these events I would never have gone to without Caltech's funding or without the support of friends I've met here, and a few I can earnestly say have changed my life. Next term, thanks to Caltech, I'll be studying abroad at Cambridge.

Caltech has made me a fundamentally better person. It's taught me over and over again that I am capable of more than I ever imagined, and it's granted access to opportunities and *people* I'd be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. I nearly chose different university out of fear Caltech might be ""too hard"" - I can't be happier about my choice.

Feel free to ask questions about Caltech, I haven't covered close to everything. I will be honest about the downsides too - it is not a school for everybody."
Is Caltech kinda bad?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/1f1gmgt/is_caltech_kinda_bad/,16,41,2024-08-26 05:29:27,"I just saw some guy's posts and basically called out some of the bad things about Caltech. Most of the replies said what the person was saying was true, but also some of it was false. Can someone give me the actual dirt on the cons of Caltech? I really don't want to be stressing over trying to get in only to find out the school's staff sucks.

(I had also read a post earlier this year talking about how there was a guy or his friend who was playing on the Caltech tennis court, I think? And one of the Caltech professors had tried to use his authority on the friend to leave the court so that he could play? But the friend wasn't a part of Caltech, so the guy got mad and called the cops or something? I forgot, but please give me some clarity.)"

-If you don't want to join a house, there are essentially no other options for social life. 

-Unlike other schools, the clubs here are a joke. They are even worse than high school clubs because these people don't care.

-We all leave here stunted because the admin is super strict and everyone basically lives on campus, but they also have the worst housing filled with cockroaches and other nasty stuff.

-We're also all stunted because there's literally zero respect for the humanities. Caltech doesn't teach us how to think and tells us to look down on those who try to learn anything but STEM

-The classes SUCK because the faculty doesn't care about us at all and only cares about their research. 

-The area is super lame. It's just a massive, super rich, nimby suburb. If you don't have a car and aren't willing to ride the super sketchy LA metro, good luck finding anything fun to do off campus. 

-The sports here are simultaneously the worst in the world (go check out quantum hoops for our basketball team's record-breaking losing streak) and also way too intense where they are constantly burning students out. Like, come on, we're bad, that's fine, just let us enjoy our sport. 

-The student body is as homogenous and boring as they could make it while still appearing to satisfy DEI. And the students that are actually diverse they make work extra hard because they are the recruitment staff's go to models for everything. Literally, if you're black, get ready for them to use you as a poster child. 

-The campus has some really intense history of eugenics. This isn't explicitly eugenics, but it's sure giving bad, tone-deaf vibes especially given how hard we work as students already and how everyone is coming from wildly different backgrounds: https://tech.caltech.edu/2024/04/26/letter-sat-reinstatement/ . Like jeez, if you think we're bad at math, maybe try being better teachers... 

-The price tag is insane, but for what? I've once heard a department head bragging about how tuition only makes up 2% of the school budget and how they could make the school free with no issues if they felt like it.

* What activities should my Curriculum Vitae include?
* The GRE test (both general and for physics) is not required however it ""may provide another way for an applicant to demonstrate a strong physics background"". Is it necessary then?
* How should I obtain a recommendation letter?
* What should I do in order to have research experience? How could I, with the limited tools of an undergraduate student, do some research in physics?
* Do I have to choose the field of research before sending my application?
* Are there any additional courses I should take, besides those of an undergraduate physics program, that might be helpful for the admission process and also for the actual PhD?

Transferring to Caltech,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/1enrpw1/transferring_to_caltech/,4,9,2024-08-09 05:25:21,"I am a rising sophmore at a state university and I am considering applying as a transfer to Caltech. I came in with a lot of credit from APs and took summer classes so I have gotten a good feel for the higher level classes and they are honestly not challenging enough. Another reason I am looking to transfer is because I like the idea of a closer knit community at a smaller college than that of a large state school and I have heard Caltech has a very collaborative (and STEM centeric) culture, which is pretty important to me. I am double majoring in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (trying to minor in physics too) but it seems like double majoring is tough at Caltech so I would most likely just do chemistry. I have a very comfortable 4.0/4.0 (unweighted) taking as many honors classes as possible. I have taken all the course work relating to the entrance exam already (which does not seem very hard). I am doing research and have pretty good extracurriculars. It seems like they also look at my highschool grades and I was wondering how much weight they put on those because I was definetely not as good of a student then as I am now (though I was still well within the top 10% at a very competative public high school). I also would assume they don't want to look at my standardized test scores like act or sat subject tests, but I would like confirmation on that if anyone knows. 

I have been looking though the subreddit and have seen a few posts about transferring so I know how low the chances are, but I have not really seen a ton of discussion around non-community college transfers so I am really wondering if I will even be considered. I feel like there is not much more I can do to make my application significantly more competative other than maybe getting research published or doing some crazy extracurriculars. 

I also was wondering how important writing quality (versus content quality) is for the supplemental essays since I don't necessarily pride myself on my writing abilities (as you can probably tell).

Caltech is not the only place I am planning on applying to, but it does seem like my favorite so far so I could really use some good feedback before I sink a ton of time into my application."

I'm looking for some advice as I'm thinking about transferring to Caltech (if admitted). I chose to go to an in-state school that would let me take on a lot of work and gain experience in multiple fields via a triple major with a double minor (specifically, Quantitative Finance, Mathematics, Economics BS. with Physics and Geospatial Intelligence minors). I'm finishing the remainder of my mathematics courses this semester, and can finish my degree in a year and a half (currently a rising sophomore with junior academic standing, 3.8 cumulative GPA). While I love the fact that I have the opportunity to pursue as many things as I am, the school I'm at is an R2 institution and doesn't get much money for grants. Additionally, our turnover to grad school isn't great. 

I'm currently weighing whether or not to transfer to Caltech for the remainder of undergrad (or some other R1 university) with the intent to double major in Mathematics and Economics, or just apply for grad school in Mathematics and graduate from my current institution early (in the next year). 

If I transfer to Caltech, I'll have to complete the portion of the core curriculum that I haven't done at my current university, which would add some time to my current graduation plan. If I don't transfer (to Caltech or any other R1 school), I am worried that my options for grad school will be severely limited despite everything I'm currently doing.

Caltech has been a dream school of mine for a while now, and now that I'm actually admitted and doing more research, I have a couple of questions that I'd love to get answered. I'm a prospective computer science major who's goal is to enter industry and I'd like to know:

1. Major: I saw in 2023's grad data that there's a relatively high percentage of CS majors. Does this affect how large/hard-to-get classes are? Has it also made CS more competitive in terms of getting opportunities (research, internships, etc)?

2. Theory vs Practical: I also realize that Caltech's CS curriculum heavily emphasizes theory. Can any alum describe whether/how they've been able to use their acquired theoretical knowledge in an industry setting? 

3. P-sets: I've read a lot about the wild amount of time y'all spend doing problem sets. Is the time you spend working on the problems hard in the ""I want to set this on fire and throw this out of a window"" kind of way, or do you get in what you put in - like you're making progress consistent with your efforts. On average, how long do you spend on homework per day? Also, any tips on managing burnout?

4. Work study: Part of my fin aid package involves work-study, and I'm slightly concerned about working on top of what appears to be a huge workload. Can anyone who does work-study give their opinion about managing this extra commitment?

5. How much sleep do you get???

January 16, 2024

Dear faculty colleagues:

Over the past few years, faculty colleagues across campus have noticed and commented on a sharp decline in the quantitative skills of our undergraduate students. In particular, although many of our undergraduates are of the same caliber as in the past, there has been a concerning drop in preparedness at the low end of the distribution. This decline has worsened with recent changes in our admissions practices, and is particularly acute for the current sophomore class. An inordinate number of students are failing courses, honor code violations are on the rise, and requests for tutors and extensions have substantially increased. Some faculty report having to adjust grading practices, as well as course content, to the change in student population.

We fear that this decline will have disastrous consequences for our students’ training and career outcomes, for Caltech’s educational mission, and for Caltech’s reputation at large.

The goal of this letter is to initiate discussion and action on this critical and urgent matter.

Below we consider possible causes for the decline. Based on these reasons, we believe that the problem requires both immediate action as well as longer term improvement and monitoring in admissions practices.

I personally delivered over 7000 orders at UCLA. I got stoners their munchies, studiers their caffeine, and athletes their hydration. It’s a pretty interesting business - Average Order Value is $15 and profit turns out to be $6-8 per order. Duffl owned a retail space that warehoused all our inventory but that probably wasn’t very optimal. It was far too expensive.

The marketing was easy. Every single customer who got their order in <15 minutes was blown away - they’d never seen anything like this. They immediately tell all their roommates and friends. From there, virality takes over and you grow like crazy. The supply chain is also easy. It’s pretty easy to figure out what people want (Diet coke and cheetos), and you can buy it wholesale at costco or on sale at your local grocery store.

The hard part is really just the app. You need a way for people to pick what they want and order; you need a way to process transactions; you need a way to track and deliver orders. You might be able to use shopify but it’s not cut and dry.

If I were to go back to college, I would start my own delivery business out of my dorm / apartment (don’t have to pay rent on a retail space), see what snacks / drinks my friends want, deliver them within 15 minutes (car, bike, scooter, etc.), and make $50+ / hour for being open just a few hours a day.

Specifically, they end up in Millikan Pond (east of Caltech Hall) and at the bottom of the stairs south of The Mabel and Arnold Beckman Laboratories of Behavioral Biology.

I walk through the campus every day and find myself doing ""turtle watch"" to make sure that no turtles have gotten into either of these places. Any turtle that falls into Millikan Pond has no means of getting out, nowhere to rest from swimming, and no food. Similarly, any turtle that tumbles down the stairs cannot get back up, has no protection from the sun, and no water or food.

Any time I find a turtle in either of these places, I place them back at the ponds. Since they usually end up in Millikan Pond, I often have to take off my shoes and wade in to get them. So far I've only found one dead turtle at the bottom of the Behavioral Biology stairs but that's enough to be distressing.

Does anyone else do this? And can Caltech do something about this? I honestly feel like the best solution is just to not have any turtles at all, since building safeguards for them would likely ruin the aesthetic of the campus, cost them money, and people clearly disregard the signs prohibiting feeding them, since they come out of the water and follow people that get close.

If anything it would just be nice to know that I'm not the only one lookin' out for the little guys. 🐢"

My budget is around $900 - 1300 a month.

**About me**

* Iranian-born and Australian-raised, I still have the thickest American accent of anyone I know.
* Loves a good road trip! Having been in LA for almost a year now, I realize that having a car is almost a must for the adventurous. Needless to say, I hope to get a car by fall.   
* If I were an autocrat, I would mandate the installation of bidets in every bathroom. That is to say, I am very clean.
* I play the piano and have recently gotten into jazz improv (please someone stop me before I abuse the ii-V-I any further).
* I like the idea of cooking more than cooking itself and it has historically taken me two hours to make spaghetti and meatballs. I promise I've become more efficient since.
* I love going to art galleries. Bonus if I get to stand before an abstract work and mutter that the piece ""doesn't know what it wants to be.”
* I work in sporadic and intense bursts of productivity. Outside of these bursts, I enjoy going out with friends and watching movies.
* If the whole physics gig goes south, I might just drop out and become a video essayist or smth
* LGBTQ+ friendly

**About you**

* Have a penchant for exploring LA. 
* Be fun!
* Clean, reliable, and friendly.
* LGBTQ+ friendly.

If you're interested in teaming up or are looking for a roommate yourself pls DM me so we can find a place and live our best lives."

We can't even find one professor who focus on NLP, and there are fewer than five professors in AI, including Yang Song. There’s also not a single professor who specializes in systems. Why is this the case? Why does Caltech maintain a disinterested stance while every other school is focusing on AI? I’m quite disappointed.

So for some background, I am a California high school student who got into Berkeley M.E.T (dual degree program in business and engineering, similar to Pen M&T) and Caltech and am planning to major in Materials Science & Engineering + Business Administration at M.E.T or double major in Materials Science + Business, Economics, and Management (BEM) at Caltech. I'd really like to go into the startup world and entrepreneurship, focusing on innovations in materials science and computational fields that are related, possibly exploring more CS-related topics aswell like AI/ML. Im not opposed to going to grad school but would like to spend some time working first before I go into it. Here are a couple of pros I think each side has

**Berkeley M.E.T pros:**

Great connections and staff/people backing you w/ personal attention

Great internship connections that can help get a headstart in the startup/industry world

Silicon Valley

Large school with great social life (I think???)

part of large research university w/ lots of studies, students, and research going on

**Caltech pros:**

Small and personal classes

Professors are easy to connect to and research is easy to get

Id be on the soccer team

Pasadena is a great neighborhood, campus is beautiful, and dorms are comfortable.

LA is potentially a burgeoning startup area (not too sure)

**ps**. (I don't want to make decisions based on cost but Berkeley is in-state tuition)

I was hoping to hear what you guys think of maybe where is a better place to go and what are some cons of each place aswell."

1. How many graduate options offer a joint BS/MS degree? In the latest catalog, I could only find two graduate options that specifically mention this: physics and mathematics.

https://preview.redd.it/03uxxelifbtc1.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=702ed55985292f10df52751b429aa3bb88d91c9b

Is it possible that there are some BS/MS programs that aren't written in the catalog, since it states that ""Students should contact the graduate option representative to find out if the joint B.S./M.S. degree is offered in a particular option""?

2. Does one have to major in something that matches the MS they are trying to obtain? For example, if one were to get a BS/MS in physics, do they have to major in physics first, or can they major in something else and complete the physics MS requirements independent of their major?

As for why I need this information, this might sound weird but I just like to construct imaginary study plans for various universities to kill time, kind of like solving puzzles. I have finished my undergrad elsewhere, and I'm not a Caltech student, but I would scour through catalogs of many other universities and challenged myself to construct study plans that fulfil certain requirements, such as completing a double major, an honors program, or an “upgraded” degree like this one and Harvard’s AB/AM and AB/SM. It’s also interesting to me that one can get a UK-style master's degree (bachelor’s + master’s in 4 years) while studying in select universities the US.

Any info would be appreciated. Thanks in advance."

I would receive around 10-15k of financial aid yearly from GT but none from Columbia and Caltech. 

I have the Egleston Scholar designation and I really like Columbia’s campus, the diverse community, the prestige and connections, and the accelerator programs, but I’m not sure if Columbia is worth it over GT, which is also very strong for CS, would allow me to transfer my community college credits and graduate in 3 years with a possible additional year for an MS/CS, and has the CREATE-X program (will be visiting the campus soon). Caltech is also very strong for STEM but I'm not sure if it be the right fit for someone like me who is wanting to pursue entrepreneurship and SWE because of the extreme course rigor and its main research focus. I like both location wise as they’re both in cities however Pasadena felt a bit more isolated (have visited).

I’m really curious if any of these colleges would have an advantage over the others in terms of networking opportunities and resources for a startup, if one would be more beneficial for acquiring SWE internships, and if one would help me better achieve a PhD. How is the entrepreneurship culture at these colleges?

Any advice on the colleges, or what factors I should look into, will be extremely appreciated.

caltech

-will turn me into an incredible thinker and problem solver with a multidisciplinary approach to biology research questions (CORE curriculum)
-extremely collaborative and family-like community 
-no shortage of research opportunities 

stanford
-amazing institution, highly regarded in all fields
-more “college-like” experience ??
-us news ranks them #1 in biological sciences
-LOVE the campus, vibe, and food (although I’ve never been to caltech’s campus or tried their food)

i realize that several of these points could actually be interchangeable between the two schools, that is what makes this decision difficult.  i did read this one post one time from a hiring rep for some stem company that seeing a degree from caltech really stood out amongst the numerous other stanford and mit degrees.

all in all, i just want to serve and help as many ppl as i can, and with my passion being biology, i want to understand the biological world as close to 100% as i humanly can in order to come up with ways to help others (whether that is through researching fundamental biology or biomedical).  i will definitely get PhD after undergrad, have occasionally thought abt MDPhD.

On the other hand, Caltech has 59 grad students in their EE dept. Not 590, it is 59. This is crazy. How does Caltech even compete with the other universities? BTW, is this smallness of the department a good thing or a bad thing? Any Caltech grad students here?

**Added:** TL;DR: Why the downvote? this was kinda a praise to Caltech folks' quality.

Hey Caltech students I didn't mean to insult Caltechers. I mean, Caltech has very decent US rankings, which are based on academic reputation - and basically, the bigger the student body, the better the reputation (non-successful PhDs are anyway ruled out from academia, so academic reputation will be basically proportional to the number of productive PhDs, which will be proportional to the PhD program size...); which makes Caltech's decent rankings very peculiar, at least imho  
Sorry if this insulted anybody, I am extremely shocked (and fascinated) by the small size, and just wanted to ask whether Caltech grad students are satisfied by this small size or not.

For instance I'm a cornell student rn and when you look at cornell cs faculty it shows a very vague ""research areas"" field along with their name and picture and all that saying they study AI or theory or whatever.

But when you look at caltech faculty from what I've found it's just their names with minimal additional info leaving you to manually search through all of them to find people in your field of study

I'd say the area of research I'm most interested would fit under some combination of systems, networking, architecture, and vlsi so if anyone could more precisely point me to people working in something relevant that'd be cool too"

Question about Transfer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/1awwqb8/question_about_transfer/,16,7,2024-02-22 03:50:38,"tl;dr: Wondering if I can self-study and have that work for the transfer placement exam since my community college will have me wait a while before I can take the courses I need.

To preface, I know Caltech only accepts around five transfers a year, typically doesn’t accept from community colleges (I go to one), and that I should set my sights on somewhere else. No need to remind me of that. I mainly want to apply to Caltech’s undergrad program as a transfer because I never got to apply as a first-year even though it was my top school, and it just doesn’t sit right with me to not at least try to apply for transfer. I have other much more realistic transfer options that I will apply to as well.

For some background: I went to one of the top high schools in the US, a STEM magnet at that, and was one of the best students there (I even did particle physics research while I was attending), but had to leave and get a GED last semester due to extenuating circumstances. Now I’m in my first semester at my local community college and am forced to repeat courses on material I already know at a much slower pace and with far less rigor than I am used to.* On top of that, because I started this spring instead of the fall, I have to wait until the spring of next year to take quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. Obviously it’s not the end of the world (especially since I get to be a year ahead of people my age!**) but it is a bit annoying with the timing of Caltech’s transfer exams since I would have to take them that same semester. 

So for those of you who read through all of this (thanks, by the way <3), my question is if it would be okay for me to self study the content of the transfer exam and then take it even though I technically wouldn’t have completed an official course for some of the content. I’ll probably be self studying a lot anyways because I love math + physics and want to learn as much as I can in those subjects (and I also happen to have way more free time now that my workload is much lighter), so this is more of just seeing if I can at least take advantage of what I’ve learned while potentially applying to Caltech.

Also, I’m a physics major if that’s relevant at all. Sorry if the formatting is weird, I’m on my phone at the moment so I can’t do much.




*: I mean this in no offense to community college students in general or their intellect; I am well aware that most of my peers here did not have or were unable to take advantage of the opportunities I had, and that they are working very hard to try to do the best they can in life. Some of them are just as (if not even more) intelligent and hard working as the kids I went to high school with but just didn’t have any chances to learn and grow academically until now. I just felt like I had to make this statement to avoid what I said coming off the wrong way.

**: If you’re confused as to how I would be a year ahead even though I missed the fall, it’s because I’m making up that semester this summer. "

I'm applying for undergrad admission to Caltech. I'm not exceptionally smart, just love math and physics (and chemistry as it relates to physics) and want a research-focused school. Plus peers that know more than me about my interests. 

I haven't done any research/math competitions (tried to start a math club but there was no interest)/science fairs. I do volunteer tutor in math and chemistry though (also English and Spanish). I hold 2 leadership positions in school clubs (newspaper and NHS). I've taken 26 community college courses and my schedule is the most rigorous in my class (per my advisor), however, I doubt this means anything at all. That's average.

However, I have always dreamt of attending Caltech and was denied admission for this year. I’ve looked through the transfer admissions requirements, and it seems doable enough, but I’m not sure if I should go for it.

Pros: 
Caltech has a distinct astronomy/astrophysics undergraduate degree program while CMU awards a degree in physics (with an emphasis in astronomy)

Caltech is a more hands on University that offers a greaser deal of research opportunities (from what I’ve read)

Overall, Caltech appears to be more rigorous and creative, making it a place that I would fit in at very well.

Cons:
I would have to study 2 years of advanced undergraduate mathematics and physics in a few months while preparing for the Putnam competition and completing regular coursework at the same time (This timeline can be extended if I opt to transfer after 2 years)

I’ve been told that transferring Universities may have a negative impact on grad school applications

Caltech has about a 5% transfer acceptance rate as of the 2022-2023 year

Questions on GALCIT and its research from a prospective student,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/14ay5e5/questions_on_galcit_and_its_research_from_a/,2,5,2023-06-16 14:21:32,"Greetings from Florida. I am presently a materials science and engineering undergraduate at the University of Florida on track to graduate summa cum laude in the fall with minors in physics and math. I chose my bachelor's degree as it aligned with my aptitude for chemistry in high school, my interest in the theoretical underpinnings of engineering, and my desire for a more broadly-applicable degree.  

However, my heart has always been with space exploration, and after I read about what GALCIT had to offer, I decided it would be my dream graduate school. I am planning to apply for a PhD in space engineering this fall, and as part of that I am doing background research on GALCIT's admissions, fields of interest, and faculty.

First, I was wondering if any accepted GALCIT students had advice on how to organize my statement of purpose. I know that Caltech is a highly interdisciplinary institution that values finding different approaches to solving problems. JPL itself originated from a PhD dissertation project by GALCIT student Frank J. Malina, who had to invent much of the then-unknown theoretical basis of rocketry using his grasp of mathematics and mechanical engineering knowledge. As I am not coming from a traditional mechanical or aerospace engineering background, I will have to highlight how my materials engineering education will bring a fresh perspective to the problems of aerospace engineering.

In terms of research experience, I had an independent research internship at the [Extreme Light Infrastructure-Nuclear Physics institute](https://www.eli-np.ro/) in the summer of 2022 where I conducted exploratory research using magnetic force microscopy (which the staff was unfamiliar with), and I currently have both an ongoing undergraduate senior thesis project to predict nuclear fission gas release in a microstructure using convolutional-recurrent hybrid neural networks and a summer internship at NASA's Glenn Research Center, where I am assembling a database for hydrogen aircraft materials. I expect the senior thesis project to net me two papers and a conference presentation at [MS&T23](https://www.matscitech.org/MST/MST23) this October.

My second question is on the research interests of GALCIT's faculty. On Caltech's 2022-2023 course catalog and on GALCIT's main research page, in-space manufacturing is mentioned as a subject of interest to GALCIT. However, looking around the individual faculty pages, I could not find any faculty member who listed space manufacturing or other space industry as a subject they were actively researching. The closest I could find is Caltech's space solar power project. Are there any GALCIT students who know which professors are engaged in research on space manufacturing or in-space industry?"

Is it possible to get research / publications experience at Cal Tech after graduating from undergrad from another university, preferably in a part-time role? I looked at the opportunities available online at Cal Tech, and it seems like all of them are for current undergraduate students, i.e. SURF etc. If anyone can provide any tips about how I can go about doing this, or have personal experience in doing this, I would greatly appreciate it. If there are any remote opportunities too, that would be even better.

Some background on me. I am an applied math graduate from UCLA, and I currently work as a software engineer for one of the big U.S. defense contractors. I am considering on applying for research scientist positions at my company in the next couple of months to help me get research experience, and I wanted to get even more research experience at Cal Tech. For my situation, Cal Tech is the closest university to me that I could realistically commute to while having a full-time job, so that is why I was specifically looking at Cal Tech.

Also, yes, I realize that Caltech and Michigan are very different.

Some important background: 

* I want to do a math/physics major with the goal of getting a PhD and doing research
* I focused heavily on academics, so I have done math up to graduate PDEs and functional analysis and physics up to Griffiths EM and QM (among others)
* I live RIGHT next to UMich (and have taken many classes there)
* I have amazing financial aid from both

It more or less boils down to:

Caltech: 

* small, tight knit community (+ house system)
* more personalized, 1 on 1 with professors
* extremely rigorous and STEM research focused
* socially open and collaborative environment
* nice weather and close to rocky nature

Michigan

* right at home (I'm very close with my family)
* more diverse student body (background and interests)
* very strong math program, analysis and PDEs in particular
* greater number of clubs and opportunities
* more active social life

\*Clarification about social life: I do NOT seek the stereotypical ""college partying and hookup culture"" social life, but I do want to be in an environment where there is a certain amount of extroverts, diverse personalities, and people with a good sense of humor (is Caltech like this?).

All this together, what are your thoughts? Thanks!"

I've been working for most of my 20s and 30s with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and have been continually using a poor excuse to just delay grad school.  ""Let's work another year and grow my school fund a little more"" kind of mindset/excuse.  This went on for about 7 years...

My company recently furloughed all of its staff (can you guess which company that is?) so that poor excuse is suddenly gone!

Terrible situation aside, I'm now HIGHLY considering taking this opportunity to pursue a PhD in Planetary Geology.  Always loved geology and found out (while working) that I truly enjoy being an SME of a very niche subject.

My current plan is to get a second bachelors in Geology while building up my research experience, then apply to the Caltech PhD program.

Am I crazy?  Many people are telling me to just get an M.S. in Geology, but I believe I'd need to take 2-3 years of undergrad core Geology courses.  Not even including the pre-reqs I'd probably need to re-take since it's been over a decade.  I...forgot a lot...

Also in Computation and Neural Systems *if* possible. 

My first question is if double majoring is practical. I want to do as much research as I can during my undergraduate and If a second major would severely interfere with time to do research then that's also a reason that I wouldn't do it. The reason I would want to do an extra major in CNS is because my second interest, right behind physics, is machine learning, and my dream task is research at the intersection of physics, quantum computing, and machine learning. I think that I could keep learning machine learning through text books and reading papers (that's what I've been doing for the past two years anyways) but I think that Caltech would be able to teach me far better. So in your minds would it be a worth while / practical endeavor to do such a double major?

My second question has to do with the house system, I saw a post from 4 years ago which claimed that the house system was de facto dismantled or something. Is the house system still up and running as a hogworts esk support community system?

My third question is simply: how was your physics experience at Caltech in research and class?

My fourth question is simply if you could share any general advise for succeeding at Caltech.

There are some questions I have regarding the application process, and I am not 100% lost since I already finished all Caltech required supplementals and additional (non-required) supplemental essays and am in the process of rewriting, revising, and making them better.

Anyway, some questions I have particularly pertain to the **Maker/Research Portfolios** that Caltech allows for applicants to submit. Although I know they are probably similar to any university portfolio (I submitted a Maker Portfolio to MIT about my electrical engineering project involving salinity detectors), I am mainly asking for what does Caltech look for in its applicant's portfolios. Do they want a video? A series of images with descriptions? What is it that they specifically want (for MIT they made it clear about how they wanted the portfolios done). Also, does Caltech allow for the submission of **Music and/or Arts Portfolios** similar to MIT? 

Another few questions are about the environment of Caltech. I visited MIT a handful of times, a few times walking and another few times biking through the campus and I absolutely loved the campus and the environment. I haven't yet gotten the opportunity to visit Caltech's campus (I wanted to visit during the national science olympiad tournament but that was held online.....sad moment) yet, but a friend of mine (who applied to Caltech REA) told me that it was small but beautiful and vibrant. I'm hoping to get a chance to visit Caltech in the November break but I can't be sure, so I guess I'm on here asking Caltech students how Caltech's environment is. I know that it's demanding and pressuring, but how is the student environment? How is the collaboration like? Are teachers/professors there open to supporting students and collaborating on research? How is the SURF program at Caltech? How is the area of Pasadena that surrounds Caltech?

When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me.

Berkeley vs Caltech CS?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/uiowcx/berkeley_vs_caltech_cs/,13,16,2022-05-05 04:03:25," Hi!

So today I got a call saying that I was admitted to Caltech off the waitlist (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). I am currently committed to UC Berkeley for a double major in CS and DS. Now I'm not so sure where to go.

My main issue with Caltech stands in my major: CS is what I applied for. My main goal after undergrad is to 1) get a Master's, and 2) work in healthcare technology, in industry jobs combining machine learning and health (ex: companies like Verily, Tempus, Insitro, etc). Does Caltech prepare you for industry? I've heard the education is very theoretical, and doesn't really prepare you for the real world. Is it true that Caltech is better for those wanting to obtain a master's degree?

In undergrad, I also want to do research on technological applications to health inequities. Berkeley has a Digital Health Equity and Access Lab - Caltech has nothing of the sort from what I've researched, no machine learning + health labs. I'm not sure what kind of research I would do there; I'm not too interested in machine learning theory.

But Caltech offers more personalized education to undergrads with a much lower class size. The faculty, from what I've seen, is incredible. The campus is breathtaking. This year's class seems so interesting and unique... it's a very difficult decision, and I'm lucky to have it, but I am very confused.

Any advice (like literally ANYTHING) is appreciated. What do you think I should do?"

At CalPoly we were able to go into some engineering buildings and saw their wind tunnels and other aerospace-specific facilities, and looked at their course curriculum for BA - Aerospace

That curriculum looks REALLY compelling. Campus was nice too.

I feel like Caltech is a stronger school and certainly more exclusive and impressive. Has anyone here done an aerospace minor at Caltech and how would you say the curriculum and facilities stack up against what CalPoly is offering?

Any other factors that should be considered?

One option might be to do undergrad at Poly and grad at Caltech later."

I recently got into this data science bootcamp that seems to be upselling themselves a lot using the Caltech and IBM brand names. They're offering a 10% scholarship that really just seems like something everyone gets, and they seem pretty desperate to get people admitted. They waived around this 7% admission rate for the bootcamp that I highly doubt is accurate. To me it seems like a great bootcamp at an good value from a reputable source, but I was wondering what some students here thought of it. 

Some background on myself: 

I am a current teacher looking to teach computer science at public high schools.

I am seeking to find some kind of description of the graduate cohort, for the Physics department (the particular year is less important). In the spirit of transparency, I am hoping to test the hypothesis that Cal Tech admits students from a wide range of undergraduate backgrounds into its graduate physics program. Of course, I already know that this is the most likely case, but finding some evidence would really help me put to bed the notion -- put forward by others, in other forums -- that only Ivy League and top international applicants are admitted. The strongest piece of evidence that I can think of would be some official Cal Tech document that lists all the many different undergraduate institutions grad students were admitted from. At least, we had something like this at my school, that we offered to the incoming class so they could see where their colleagues hail from (likely all over the place). I'm also happy to hear first-hand experiences about the diversity of the graduate student body. Alright.

Peace,

1. I'm planning on majoring in CS and I'm very set on pursuing SWE. I know Caltech heavily emphasizes research, but I did some research over the summer and I had mixed feelings toward it (of course high school research doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of undergrad research). Will I be left out if I don't focus on research? I'm going to give it another try but I was wondering what it would be like if I don't like it.
2. How can I prepare myself? Impostor syndrome is creeping in already and I know the curriculum is no joke. CS is my strength but I'm not brilliant, I'm alright at math and physics, and I struggle a bit with chem and bio. Are there any textbooks or resources that I can use to make the transition a bit easier?

I’m very interested in the 2 year graduate program as I intend to do a PhD at GALCIT. My questions in bullet points:

1.) What is the common quality of the students? I’m asking this because I’d like to know what it takes to be successful and stand out amongst all other applicants for the program. 

2.) Did you guys already have the idea what projects you are going to work on before going into the program?? 

3.) If so, what are you advices on how to build a sharp vision of what you want to do in field? I am already in my first semester of a mechanical degree( a master, I did physics bachelor with an average gpa)  I have never thought about what speciality and specific research I should focus on or having some unique insight; all I know is: okay next year I’m going to take dynamics and control systems, and then in the final year I’ll be interested in propulsion. As you can see I only have a very general and vague idea about aerospace engineering, not to mention I know what I’m going to specify in.. Therefore, I’m seeking advice on how to think of and where to look relevant projects. 

4.) What are the books that you think they have big impact on you as a student in engineering and research engineer? Or even, your world view and values on every aspect of life? 

5.) frankly I’m only an average studnet, I feel like an imposter just to thinking about applying to Caltech, but the other side of me do not want to give up. Do you think I’m just frittering away my time if my gpa is just meh ? I have one experience in research and I can see how competitive the people are. 

I’ve heard about the collaborative culture at Caltech and everyone’s actually dedicated to their study. I’m super jealous of this as I can hardly find a buddy at university to study and work hard together.

I'm a prefrosh at Caltech intending to major in CS. I am interested in exploring research and possibly going on to grad school for a PhD. This might change though as I don't have a lot of experience with CS research so I don't know for sure if its right for me. But I definitely do want to try it out. I had a few questions about this:

1. I know that its generally not difficult to get a SURF over the summer, but how difficult is it to get research during the school year (and specifically during freshman year)? Especially if I don't have much prior experience in CS research.
2. Is getting involved in certain fields of CS research more competitive than others as an undergrad at Caltech? Like is it more difficult to get involved in machine learning research specifically (as it is a very popular field). 
3. How difficult is it to handle research during the school year along with classes? How much of a time commitment is it generally? What kind of effort do professors / grad students expect undergrad students to put in? 
4. If I later want to  apply to top PhD programs, is there any advice you have for doing research? For example, is it better for me to focus all the research I do onto one specific field or can I explore different areas of CS research? Should I be aiming to get publications out of the research I do? Are there any other activities I should pursue?
5. Are there any skills that you would recommend I develop / anything I should learn so that I can more effectively be involved in research? 

I don't know a lot about how undergrad research at Caltech and grad school admissions work so I would really appreciate any feedback/advice! I also do plan on taking the Introduction to Computer Science Research course at Caltech which I think will be helpful for better introducing me to CS research. Thank you."

So first, I know that Caltech is indisputably more reputable than Columbia for STEM. However, I’m not entirely sure if I want to go into heavy technical STEM. But regardless of that, I know that like any top university, the best students are equal in ability. It’s more the lower bound that differs drastically since Caltech has a much smaller class size. This brings me to my main point: I think academically, no matter where I go I’m going to work hard to become the best version of myself academically. However, I think my growth as an individual would drastically differ depending on the school I choose. I’ve heard of people that love Caltech, but I’ve also talked to many people who sort of regret it. This is what I’m scared of. I feel like it’s much easier to burnout at Caltech than it is to at Columbia, but that’s just off of my conversations with people from both schools about their time there. Would you say that it’s necessary to go to a school as academically intense as Caltech? I’m pretty sure Caltech is the hardest undergraduate experience of any college, but I’m not sure if that’s meant for me. I see my goals as a displacement, where I can get to the same place I want to be, but the journey at Caltech seems much harder than Columbia. Do you think it’s worth it? The smartest people I’ve met went to Caltech for PhDs, and went to a whole myriad of different undergraduate universities. But that’s the thing, they never really burned out in undergrad which is how they got to that level for higher education. I’m scared if I go to Caltech I may burn out as I’ve seen in a few ppl that go there. Thanks so much for the taking the time to read this, any insights are appreciated."

We are thrilled to share that the Pasadena Public Health Department has approved our summer plans. Further, the city has indicated the Institute can proceed with plans to reopen campus residences and classrooms this fall to fully vaccinated undergraduate and graduate students.

Beginning June 14, Caltech will house up to 385 fully vaccinated undergraduate students participating in on-campus research, learning, and training activities, with priority for individuals participating in the [Summer Undergraduate Research Fellows (SURF)](http://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/surf) program, the [WAVE Fellows](https://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/wavefellows) program, and the [Freshman Summer Research Institute (FSRI)](https://diversity.caltech.edu/fsri), as well as pre-season student-athletes who traditionally arrive before the start of the fall term for training exercises and competition. Undergraduates enrolled in two engineering lab courses—EE85: Analog and RF Circuits Laboratory and ME13/113: Mechanical Prototyping—that are being offered this summer, after having been canceled due to the pandemic restrictions earlier in the year, also will be able to live on campus. Students eligible for campus housing as part of any of these activities should contact the [Housing Office](mailto:housing@caltech.edu) directly to arrange their summer residency.

Do people have more information on what these amendments are about or what the reasoning is for them? (link to text and voting is in an email from the revcomm chair, I don't want to post it here bc non-Caltech people)

I am very opposed to Amendment 4 at least, it basically abolishes dues and forces ASCIT to have to negotiate for funding every year. It means Caltech could raise funding or threaten to lower it and might use that power to try to coerce ASCIT or even the IHC chair to keep quiet about other stuff. Even though the Tech is financed at 10% of dues, because the overall amount is controlled by Caltech, they could threaten to cut funding if the Tech publishes stuff they don't like. It seems very similar to the amendment that was rejected in 2020 over similar concerns.

Amendment 5 seems pretty fair, I think it's fine to not allow people to ask for yearbook refunds when money has already been spent on ordering books.

Amendment 1 seems good and probably overdue.

Amendment 2 seems fine.

I have absolutely no idea what Amendment 3 does. "" Clarify that the period between the election of new Officers and installation of new Officers must be used to help transition the new Officers. ""....like what was happening during that time before???

Amendment 6 sounds good at face value, but again, what was happening in the past? Were officers being paid? Is there some reason this needs to be included? I'm so confused.

I'm also mildly suspicious of some of these because the minutes said that some of them were suggested by administrators."

""In general, most graduate students at Caltech receive full funding for their graduate education. In fact, all doctoral students have full financial support in the form of internal or external fellowships,  research assistantships, teaching assistantships, or some combination of fellowship and assistantship support. In most cases financial assistance is awarded on an annual basis, and is dependent upon  satisfactory academic progress. A separate application for requesting financial aid is not required.  On average, more than 98% of graduate students offered admission at Caltech are offered a package of merit-based financial support that pays all tuition charges and provides them with a stipend. ""

I was curious what dictates giving more financial support (i.e. full tuition reimbursement and greater stipend) to one accepted applicant over another.

Any additional insight on this would be useful/interesting.

Choosing Between Berkeley M.E.T. (EECS + HAAS) and Caltech,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/mwl4qx/choosing_between_berkeley_met_eecs_haas_and/,17,14,2021-04-23 02:25:37,"Hey guys,

I'm trying to choose between UC Berkeley M.E.T. (a dual-degree program providing bachelor's degrees in EECS from the School of Engineering and Business Administration from HAAS) and Caltech (CS or CNS).

Cost-wise, Caltech is around 10k cheaper than MET. However, right now I'm trying to evaluate the merits of each school versus another, so feel free to disregard it in your recommendations.

Some things about me:

* I have a strong technical tilt but would eventually like to move into management roles (open to but not necessarily in a rush to do so right now, however).
* I'm most interested in going into Machine Learning/AI, and especially those fields applied towards Medicine or Neuroscience. From what I understand, however, those fields typically require holding masters/PhD degrees to get recruited for.
* Planning to do Masters at a minimum. Potentially might consider PhD.
* Ideally, I want to the industry as soon as possible. However, if PhD is necessary to enter ML/AI roles, I'm open to that as well.
* Research is fairly important to me as well as from what I understand, it's essential for entering a good grad school. UCB has BAIR, which is really impressive. However, I am unsure how easy it would be to enter it. Caltech, on the other hand, is overall, a research powerhouse. That being said, I do not want to go into academia in the future.

Some pros that I currently associate with MET are:

* Guaranteed internships at Skydeck/Y-Comb Startups with 2k/month stipend.
* Great internship recruitment pipelines. The number of companies far outnumber the students. Access to FAANG seems high, which is valuable to me. Mr. Grimes seems pretty helpful thus far, and I've heard he helps a lot in recruitment.
* Top ranked Engineering (EECS is tied for 2nd in the US) + Business School (HAAS is 3rd in the US)
* Lots of AP/CC Credits Accepted. I could potentially graduate in 3 years or pursue a 4+1 master's program, coming out with 3 degrees in 4 years.

Some cons that I currently associate with MET:

* Doing research would mean pulling away from internships/industry, which MET seems to specialize in. Also unsure about the realisticness of entering BAIR.
* For companies that don't recognize the MET brand, Caltech might hold a stronger name.
* MET alumni network is still small (the first graduating class is 2021)

Some pros of Caltech:

* Research opportunities seem to be unparalleled. I feel these will help when applying to Grad School.
* Caltech has SURF', which is a summer research program with \~85% acceptance rate. Fellows receive $6,600 for the 10-week research period.
* Caltech's brand seems to be universally recognized. Don't have the catch of only being recognized at few companies like MET.
* Caltech students are also scarcer than Berkeley in general. For companies that don't recognize MET, Caltech might stick out more than Berkeley.
* Caltech does have a BEM (Business Economics & Management), which will let me dive into the finance and quant parts from MET's Business Admin degree. Definitely not a full business administration degree but hits at parts that I'm

Some cons of Caltech:

* Doesn't have much of an industry focus, so venturing into that domain would be more difficult.
* Caltech BEM isn't anywhere close to being as well recognized as HAAS.
* I'm worried I might be funneled into more academia-related roles.

Any advice on either of the options would be really appreciated. Thank you so much in advance!"

I'm just hoping to be placed correctly, and so I'm not sure if the diagnostic is more like an AP exam than the sample practice set I found above. Additionally, then, would placement exams for Math 1abc, 2, and 3 be similar to the practice set I found above (as opposed to an AP-style exam)? Thanks, guys!"
Another incoming grad student!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/msusax/another_incoming_grad_student/,16,11,2021-04-17 17:16:24,"Hi all, just confirmed to BBE program! I have moved around the US quite a bit but this will be my first time living in CA. I have only visited Pasadena once and know it is in the outskirts of LA but with access to some great outdoor opportunities. 

What are some favorite hiking and camping spots within a days drive? Where is the best location nearby to get connected with nature?

Is there any community interest in water sports like sea kayaking or sailing? Those are both big where I am at and I would really enjoy getting on the water with others. 

How are the Catalina apartments? I need to decide if I want student housing the first year and wish I had been able to tour in person. Do students generally enjoy living on campus or is it a means to and end? Wishing I could find a spot with a yard I could kick back in but it seems like that is a luxury possibly. 

Also, anyone interested in going in on a rental house, message me and maybe we can make it happen! I heard there is a discord but haven't got the link yet.

Look forward to seeing everyone in fall!"
Placement tests at Caltech,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/mr8qqy/placement_tests_at_caltech/,14,20,2021-04-15 06:02:30,"Hello, I’ve heard that there are placement tests at Caltech and was wondering what I should expect. I don’t plan on placing out of physics or chemistry, but I heard you want to do well on one of the math placements to start at multi variable calculus level. For context, I took AP Calc BC sophomore year and multivariable calculus/differential equations/linear algebra junior year. I haven’t done calculus in a while, so I was wondering if it’s worth to brush up so I get placed correctly."
Caltech vs UCSB Grad Decision,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/mqxz4u/caltech_vs_ucsb_grad_decision/,16,19,2021-04-14 19:26:18," I am struggling immensely to choose between these options. My research  interests are in crystal growth and thin film expitaxy with applications  to functional and quantum materials. After grad school, I have  ambitions of staying in academia, taking either a postdoc or faculty  position. Personality wise, I enjoy the grind (Berkeley undergrad) but I  recognize that life is more than work. I want time to hike, bike, go to  the gym, meet girls occasionally, have friends in my cohort, ski once  in a while come wintertime, etc. Without this balance, I know I will  burn out fast (as I essentially/almost did in undergrad).

Here are my perceived pros and cons of both programs...

**Caltech Pros:**

* New PI: Presents an opportunity to learn how to set up a lab and gain skills and insight needed to succeed in academia.
* The  new PI is very well connected and already well respected. His research  is absolutely insane and very physics-ish, just the way I like it.
* Group already has some equipment set up, and has the ability to grow materials in limited capacity now.
* Freedom:  the new group presents a blank slate, and the PI is encouraging me to  choose a project I will be very interested in (pretty amazing). I will  basically co-found this lab.
* Caltech  likes to solve complex problems that are really ""out there."" I'm  hopping this means Caltech will be an opportunity to do unique research  and sculpt my own niche field.
* Caltech is stressful, but pressure makes diamonds (Berkeley for sure taught me this, the hard way).
* San  Gabriel and San Burnadino mountains absolutely rock. I grew up hiking  and skiing there, and would be excited to have that opportunity again.

**Caltech Cons:**

* New  lab will be a ton of work and risk. Time to set everything up could  result in delayed graduation, low output of results initially, PI may  not receive tenure, etc.
* I  have heard that people at Caltech only talk science and atmosphere is  very intense. I tend to get along with people who love science but are  well rounded and can talk about anything (sports, girls, beer, life in  general). Without that, I will feel very isolated and I could see my  work suffering.
* Overall, I've heard collaboration is low, and I'm worried about a high intensity and low socialization environment.
* Everyone at SB talked about work/life balance and importance of nature, while nobody at Caltech did.
* Urban  environment, need to drive to escape. Right now, I can hop on my bike  in Berkeley and be surrounded by Redwoods within minutes. At Caltech, it  might take a little more effort to escape in nature.

**UCSB Pros:**

* Established  PI's: Have several MBE systems ready to go, amazing user facilities,  amazing track records churning out world-class research and graduates.
* Ridiculous amount of collaboration and a Quantum Foundry with cutting edge research.
* Lower  risk environment. UCSB vibe is ""you can choose what kind of researcher  you want to be. If you want to grow, characterize, and write tons of  papers, you can. If you want to ease up, you can. The PI's need to make  funding contracts, but their jobs aren't on the line and their groups  are well equipt and staffed.""
* Grad school is stressful enough. Being in a relaxing place like SB where even the PIs are very chill screams ""balance"" to me.
* Everyone  at SB talked about work/life balance and importance of nature, while  nobody at Caltech did. Biking to lab along the coastline...can't beat  that! Environment is less urban, and escaping to nature is as simple as  walking down to the beach.

**UCSB Cons:**

* Too  lax/not enough push? Sometimes a kick in the ass and being face to face  with the PI is a good thing (not a fan of negative reinforcement  though). Maybe intensity is a good thing, especially if my aim is to  become a PI myself.
* Labs  are like well oiled machines. Will be obligated to work on  well-established materials, making it less likely that I will have an  opportunity to develop a niche field and contribute unique ideas during  grad school.
* San  Gabriel >>> Los Padres, but this is a very small objection  (and probably insignificant). What's more important is that I'm closer  to good skiing mountains in LA.

tldr; caltech = risky/huge reward and stressful/non-social, SB = safe/fair reward and more relaxed"

I am a current high school senior. Caltech was my dream school, but I was sadly rejected. I am going to go to UT Austin and major in physics. I am interested in quantum information and condensed matter physics, and I am very interested in the works of Alexei Kitaev and John Preskill and I want to join one of their groups for my PhD. IQIM is the greatest institute in the world for the type of physics I am interested in, and I would love to receive an education there.

F'21 into BBE... Now What?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/mjdz77/f21_into_bbe_now_what/,3,7,2021-04-03 18:15:16," 

So I got into my dream school-- and was rejected from every other school, including some master's programs (5 in total). My GPA is mediocre-- 3.5, but I went to a fairly competitive private liberal arts college for undergrad. My confidence as a student is low, but if there's one thing I do, I plan way out in advance.

I looked up a house in my hometown (Anaheim, CA), and they go for 700K+. So I need a six-figure salary by the time I'm 30. And that wouldn't happen with just a biochemistry undergraduate degree. So I bought a book, I begged undergraduate professors for their help, I applied to fellowships, etc. Now I'm hoping to make the right connections in graduate school to launch myself back to a place where I can afford the place I was born.

Any and all advice is welcome. I know I only have this one shot, so I'm not afraid to be humbled if that's what it takes to find my way back home.

**TL/DR:**

Goals: Successful Ph.D. stint, networking, successful career path in industry.

Obstacles: clinical depression, 5+ years, we've met the economy."

Is there some sort of protocol for this? Considering recent shootings around the US, I am legitimately concerned. Was hoping to get this out to Caltech students just to increase visibility and vigilance.

The text of the post is as follows:
> Not even my name on the fu\*\*ing letter? Well, thank you! Gonna make them pay and then commit suicide. The indifference of the whole process with meaningless rejections is too much to take now. I just can\`t... fu\*\*ing idiots who can barely comprehend stuff got into some program, and here all rejections! 10! I can\`t, I just can\`t. The business side of it all is too brutal to take. I can\`t cope. How do you people even cope with this sh\*\*? Gonna go there and shoot people up and then will off myself. They need to pay. On their high horses, too smart to mention my name in my letter. They are not entitled to live. It\`s a game, so I\`ll show them the real game. The indifference is what hurts; couldn\`t care less about a rejection, but the lies. The lies! They mocked and insulted my intelligence by the last line. They could\`ve lived had they really told me in clear sense what was the issue: funding, faculty didn\`t take me, didn\`t think I was prepared enough, just anything. BUT WHAT THE fu\*\* IS THAT CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE? Why do they treat others people like this? Not a modicu\* of respect. The indifferent attitude was very uncalled for. If I\`m not entitled to a reason and they are a business and can do whatever the fu\*\* they want, then I can also do whatever the fu\*\* I want. Now the tower will fall people, the tower will fall.

So I just got into Caltech rd with no aid. I also have a full tuition merit scholarship to Vanderbilt. I don't know too much about Caltech except for its insane research output. 

(1) Academics

a. How are the intro CS classes and teaching for a visual learner? What was the initial learning curve compared to high school?

(2) Stress

a. How big of a stress culture is Caltech? I have never been in a pressure cooker culture before and am a bit weary. Do kids try to one op for grades or is their a ""fake"" culture that occurs at places like UC Berk? 

b. For any bay area students that went to a high school like Gunn, Monta Vista etc. What are the culture differences at Caltech?

(3) Diversity

a. I have been at pretty undiverse schools most of my life. Think 95% white. I saw caltech is 60% male and 80% asian+white. Is this noticible on campus? Does it feel very homogeneous?

(4) Career Outlook:

a. I want to spend most of young years working on start ups, in a quant role, or at a Stripe, Uber type company. How is recruiting for places like Jane Street and other top firms? How is the start up culture and how much access do you have to blossoming companies at early stages?

(5) Grad School Outlook

a. Can an average caltech student feed into top 5 CS PhD programs? What is the law school potential for caltech? 

Final: If given the option, knowing my parents saved up 120k for college, would you go to Vanderbilt of Caltech (with my above goals and concerns)? Price difference I think Vanderbilt would be 11k (0 with parents money) for housing and food, Caltech would be 77k (47k with parents money)

1. Do people seem happy? Do they generally like the research environment? How about the community? 
2. What are the pros and cons of the smallness? Does the community feel more connected? Does it feel limiting? (I'm used to a large school). 
3. Does Caltech take good care of their grad students? Is the healthcare good? Do most grad students want to live in campus housing, and are they able to? Is there a union? 
4. Is the school pretty social? Do people make a lot of friends outside their department? Do most students mostly engage with the school community, or are they more integrated with Pasadena? Does the \~2:1 grad student gender ratio affect dating? 
5. Anything else you like / don't like, or that a prospective grad student should know? Anyone know anything about APh / physical science specifically? 

Thanks!"
How Liberal/Conservative are most CalTech Students in regards to Traditional Values?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/lgijy5/how_liberalconservative_are_most_caltech_students/,15,21,2021-02-10 01:17:26,"I’ve always heard that CalTech is known for having the “party nerds” crowd. I’ve been wondering if the stories are exaggerated, or only true for a minority of the student body, perhaps.

Specifically, I’m curious about things like premarital sex, alcohol and drugs and profanity. (Especially the first one).

For context, CalTech was always my dream school, although I couldn’t even apply for undergraduate due to various circumstances. I’ll relatively soon be graduating and am considering CalTech for my Masters/PhD. However, especially with recent events, I’ve realized how much I dislike being alone.

It might be my last chance to make friends and try dating and looking for a potential life partner. So, I’m curious what the culture is on campus and how many other people have similar values.

To clarify, I’m not ultraconservative or anything. I don’t mind if you do drugs, drink alcohol, or cuss every other word. I won’t hold it against you, you’ll still likely be a friend, I just won’t do so myself. (This would however be a turn off for a potential spouse).
My greatest concern is that I would potentially try dating someone and enter into the relationship with different expectations, potentially breaking someone’s heart, and/or my own.

Sorry if my question was vague or roundabout. I’d appreciate if any students or alumni could enlighten me regarding the campus culture. Thank you in advance!"

I'm a HS Senior (intl), applying to Caltech for the RD wave. I binged Caltech's CS 156 on YouTube and enjoyed it a lot, and I love research, and it's my absolute dream university. I have a lot of unresolved questions, since unfortunately there's a relative lack of Caltech-specific resources online. If you could help with any of these, I would greatly appreciate it!

\- Caltech's website lists CS as their most popular major - how much has this changed their focus throughout the years? How engaging is Caltech's pure CS program? On a forum in Quora, someone said they didn't even offer NLProc. This was from \~2004, what would a 2021 rendition look like?

\- What has your experience been with Caltech's core curriculum? How does it progress from freshman through senior year? (Rephrased: At what point in your undergraduate career do you dive headfirst into your major?)

\- How accessible are graduate students and faculty at Caltech? Can I engage myself conducting research under the guidance of professors outside of SURF?

\- Is ML/AI at Caltech theory focused? What sort of projects would one undertake at Caltech? Can I use Caltech's servers as free real estate for training neural networks?

\- I'm also interested in cybersecurity research, what opportunities could I take advantage of at Caltech incoporating infosec?

I am a non-Caltech student applying for Astronomy/Physics SURF this year. Based on the website, 85% of applicants get accepted every year. 

My question is who determines the admission of SURF?  The Caltech faculty mentor or the the admission committee? How do I maximize my chance of getting in? 

Will this SURF increase my chance in getting into Caltech for grad school when I apply next year? And can you please provide some suggestions for getting into Caltech for Astronomy PhD?

I had a few questions for you guys, some more specific, some more general:

* What's the workload like in senior year, especially in physics? I'm not too worried about grades, since all the courses become pass/fail for me, but I've heard some people say that senior year is more chill than junior year or something like that.

* What's the exchange student experience like in general? Does anyone know any past exchange students I could get in contact with?

* How bad are the exams? At my school there are only end of course exams, so a few each semester, and generally the split is 80% exam, 20% coursework for the grades. How do Caltech's exams compare in frequency and in importance?

* Are there any really cool courses I should take? I'm not too much of an astrophysicist, but I'm open to suggestions.

* How necessary is it to have a car? How good is biking for getting around?

* As far as I understand, I'd be staying in residence halls if the coronavirus situation permits. How are they and what kind of facilities can I expect?

* Similarly, has there been any communication as to what the next academic year will look like?

Sorry for all the long questions, I'd really appreciate it if you could answer them. Hope to see you all next year."

As a freshmen applicant to Caltech EA, I can’t help but worry about my GPA. I consistently perform poorer in my honors science courses than the AP course at my school. For instance, I scored a B+, A-, and A- in Honors Bio, Chem, and Physics (respectively) but As in both AP Bio and Chem (currently taking Phys C this year). Also, my math grades have never been great either (A- all three years). All of this has weighed down my GPA, and I’m wondering how the Caltech admissions officers might make of this, as its my dream school and they have notoriously high standards.

Any insight is appreciated. Thanks."

Key points:

* New protocols released by LA County preclude in-person instruction and on-campus dormitory living, which necessitates the decision to go fully remote for our undergraduate program in fall 2020.
* We do not believe that those protocols have direct implications for graduate students who live in apartment settings and engage in laboratory research regulated by other workplace protocols.
* In light of the ongoing public health risks to our community, we discourage undergraduate students from moving to Pasadena in order to live near campus.
* The Undergraduate Deans' Office and Office of Residential Experience will establish virtual living/learning groups for first-year students, with regular interactions and engagements with an assigned faculty advisor and undergraduate peer and graduate mentors.
* Anyone who comes to campus must adhere to Institute guidelines that mandate personal health monitoring and reporting, physical distancing, and the use of cloth face coverings."

Hybrid on-campus / online model: 

>""A pre-approved list of courses that require in-person activity will be  offered on campus, with all other courses being conducted remotely.""

On-campus residency:

>Rooms in all on-campus undergraduate residences will be limited to  single occupancy. This will reduce student density in the residences and  will maintain an appropriate student-to-restroom ratio. For fall term,  and perhaps for the remainder of the 2020-2021 academic year, Avery and  the South Houses will be reserved as quarantine and isolation spaces for  residential students in the event a student falls ill or becomes  symptomatic.

Who gets to be on-campus: 

>To support the limited re-occupation of on-campus residences, we  expect to invite undergraduate students to campus in the stages that  follow. It is important to emphasize that changes in public health  conditions and government directives at any time may restrict our  ability to accommodate all groups of students.  
>  
>1. Continuing students whose essential academic progress this year requires enrollment in courses with in-person components.  
>  
>2. International students whose presence on campus is required for maintenance of immigration status.  
>  
>3. Students  who demonstrate that their personal, financial, or academic situation  requires special consideration for on-campus housing.  
>  
>4. First-year  and new transfer students, along with some upper-class student advisors  to support the residential experience of other students.  
>  
>Depending on availability of space, continuing students who may have a  nonacademic reason to be on campus, such as student athletes, also may  have an opportunity to return to campus.

House system:

>While we understand that house affiliation in an important part of  the residential experience for many undergraduate students, the current  limits on occupancy and requirements for maintaining quarantine and  isolation space will not allow us to offer rooms in all of the houses.  For this reason, we will be making spaces available in the undergraduate  residences in the fall term, but we will not be reopening the houses.  House communities and the house experience will remain virtual for the  fall term and likely for the coming academic year.  
>  
>Similarly, the  restrictions on social gatherings and activities prohibit Caltech from  being able to allow for Rotation, a valued Caltech tradition that helps  welcome new students to campus and inaugurate the academic year.  Rotation activities are intensively and extensively social in ways that  are risky and inappropriate given COVID-19 conditions. For these  reasons, Fall term rotation has been cancelled, and the assignment of  incoming students to house communities will be discussed with student  leadership during the fall term.

I've found one other person that will be here until December and we also found an apartment at 211 S Wilson that we are interested in moving to where the rent will be $800 per person (with utilities included) and a $666.66 security deposit per person. Alternatively, if we stay at my current dwelling both of the rooms are around $833-$900 per month - not sure exactly as the rent hasn't been split evenly. The current place is at 987 E Del Mar. Both apartments are 2 bedrooms and 2 baths with hardwood floors, AC, a laundry facility or in unit (respectively), 2 parking spots, normal kitchen amenities, etc. The Wilson one might be nicer though as the current place has been lived in by many generations of students. Also, utilities are not included in the rent at the Del Mar apt. We also have the living room fashioned into my bedroom and both bathrooms are in the actual bedrooms which has not been a large issue over the years but is part of the reason we are looking to move (so I don't wake anyone at night). The apartment on Wilson is described as ""mostly furnished"" which translates into having a bed ready for you and a small looking desk+chair in the living room that id be happy to give up. Both are essentially a 3ish minute walk to campus if not for the pesky traffic light! The Del Mar apartment is also furnished for obvious reasons - but you may have to pay my current roomates for the furniture. 

All manner of people are welcome, including grad students and visiting researchers, etc. We're looking for one person for a year long lease starting in September and another person to switch out after/around new years (so January-end of August 2021). The Wilson apartment is listed as a 6 month lease but we can always renew or just ask for a longer one from the start.

If you do not return the Exam during this test period, you will not get another opportunity.

Do most Chemistry and ChemE majors place out of Ch1ab? I had always heard that placing out of classes at Caltech was extremely rare. I read the syllabus and think I know all the material of Ch1ab from taking AP Chem, but I never planned on placing out of any intro classes (assuming I could pass the placement exams) at Caltech because I figured I’d want to get properly adjusted to the rigor of Caltech through these intro classes. However, after reading that it’s “especially encouraged” to take the placement exam and reading the syllabus of Ch1ab (which seems to align almost perfectly with AP Chem), I’m having second thoughts on if that’s a good idea.

Is anyone able to weigh in? Thanks."

Caltech Aerospace Engineering Master's Degree -- How To Get Funding?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/gyh4rd/caltech_aerospace_engineering_masters_degree_how/,7,5,2020-06-07 18:05:14,"Hey everyone,

Current aerospace engineering bachelors at an R1 university looking at potential master's programs. My goal is to work in the space industry -- preferably at SpaceX, JPL, Virgin, Blue Origin type companies, either in the space systems or space GNC/astrodynamics fields. I'd love to attend Caltech's Masters in Aerospace engineering program, but the cost is exorbitant (both for tuition/fees and cost of living in LA) and they do not offer TA positions to MS students. I'm not stupid enough to take out student loans (fuck them since they drive up the cost for the rest of us) so I won't go anywhere that I won't get funding. Caltech is appealing because it's close in proximity to all of these amazing space companies, and along with USC and UCLA, Caltech is the one of the most common school for people working at these companies due to that prestige and more importantly, proximity.

**Does anyone have any feasible solutions for obtaining funding (AS AN ACCEPTED Aerospace MS candidate), preferably before I have to make any decision to commit?** i.e. As an accepted MS candidate, is it feasible to reach out to professors to secure Research Assistantship funding before I have to make a decision or is it at all likely that I'd be able to actually secure a teaching assistantship position in another department (i.e. EE, Math, etc.) as the department website suggests?"

Help ease my concerns choosing Caltech over CMU for CS,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/g0kz2v/help_ease_my_concerns_choosing_caltech_over_cmu/,20,17,2020-04-13 15:21:14,"Sorry to fill the sub with another one of these posts. Currently I'm leaning towards Caltech over CMU, but I have a few nagging concenrs I'd like to get y'all's opinion on. Obviously, I’m unable to visit either school before I have to make the choice.

Quick background on me (skip to the numbered part if you don’t care): My primary interest is in Robotics, I’d likely take additional classes in EE/ME/Robotics/CDS regardless of where I go. On CS, I’d say I’m slightly more practically oriented than theoretical (in subject area, not looking for an SWE degree), but that doesn’t mean I’m not excited about PLT/Category theory, cryptography, or the mathematics of distributed systems.

From what I’ve been able to find so far, Caltech offers challenging CS courses, if admittedly challenging in a different way than CMU. I’m not the biggest fan of the core requirements and lack of AP/college credit; some quick math showed that ***40% of all credits at Caltech will be spent taking core requirements***, (assuming 5 classes for 12 quarters averaging 9.7 credits each) compared to 23% at CMU. I’d be curious to hear more about the value of that.

My main concern is about the depth/breadth of CS classes and the variety/availability of research positions in CS/Robotics.

1. Did/does the core requirements get in the way of other classes you wanted to take? Do you plan on doing anything with the things learned in core classes? CS Alumni: Do you wish you had taken more CS or more other stuff?
2. Have you ever felt that a CS course lacked depth/breadth? How theoretical vs. practical are the curriculum offerings? Alumni: did you feel prepared for industry work, and what do you do?
   1. My concern stems from [posts like this](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-computer-science-student-at-Caltech/answer/Jessica-Su) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/sn9lg/where_should_i_go_for_undergrad_cs_berkeley_or/c4ffi82/). Quote: ""Now that I've spent some time at Stanford, I think my Caltech experience was limiting.  There were entire fields of CS that I hadn't heard of before coming to Stanford (like programming languages and HCI).  Also we didn't have a lot of systems classes, so when I got to Stanford I had to take a lot of breadth requirements that most students placed out of.""
   2. Looking at the course catalog, most bases seem to be covered. From the best I can tell, notable omissions include compilers/optimization, possibly reinforcement learning, and several courses not offered this year, without any information about their return.
3. I know there are ample research opportunities at Caltech, and that they are fairly easy to get. My concern is the availability of positions in things I’m interested in that involve meaningful work. This stems from the small size of the CS department, combined with anecdotes like [this one](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-computer-science-student-at-Caltech/answer/Martin-Michelsen): “It seemed to me that there were plenty of opportunities for research, but not many of them were pure CS; most opportunities were collaborations with other departments.” How much choice is there in research opportunities?
4. How common is it to take graduate courses?
5. (for alumni) Has core actually helped you in your career? What have you used it for? Has the Caltech “network” helped you at all?

**TL;DR:** 1. How much does core interfere with work in your major? 2. Does the smaller offering in CS courses reflect lack of depth in topics? 3. How much choice is there in research opportunities?"

I am an EU student, thinking of studying EE, currently leaning towards Caltech quite a bit!

**Caltech**:

Pros:

* More financial aid, so would be cheaper (nearly no debt after graduation)
* Many undergraduate research opportunities at places like NASA JPL, LIGO
* Unconditional offer
* Weather is much nicer
* Much smaller (could also be a con)
* Professors are very approachable
* Ability to take a minor in another subject

Cons:

* Very far away from home
* Located in suburbs, not a very ""student city"" feeling (I have not been on campus, though)
* Not such a diverse atmosphere (few international students, generally STEM majors)
* Not such a wide range of clubs

**Cambridge**:

Pros:

* Much closer to home (geographically and culturally)
* 4 years for a masters degree
* Very diverse atmosphere (a lot of international students, STEM among humanities, etc. majors)
* Cambridge is an amazing city
* Wide range of clubs
* Supervisions

Cons:

* Conditional offer (won't know if I got admitted for 100% until August)
* More expensive
* Not as much freedom in choosing what classes to take/switching majors, taking a minor
* Not as many opportunities for undergraduate research

UW CS or Caltech?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/fuq3ka/uw_cs_or_caltech/,13,30,2020-04-04 08:32:50,"I was accepted into UW CS and Caltech and am not sure what to choose for CS.

Edit:

Adding onto my question here's a little more insight as to what I'm looking for in my CS education (this is just a copy of the response I gave to hypercube42342 when they asked me what I was exactly looking for):

""My definition of better is more like at which school would I get deeper CS knowledge and experiences. Additionally, my goals are definitely to go into the corporate world after my undergrad and I am not interested in higher education like a Ph.D. So I guess the main traits that would be good for me are developing a strong CS foundation, being able to learn cutting-edge topics in CS like machine learning and quantum computing, definitely getting enough practical experience (I'm concerned by the focus on theory at Caltech), and lastly I'm also looking for getting good CS internship opportunities during the summer as well as research throughout the year.

My main concern in comparing UW to Caltech was that UW CS is ranked higher for CS than Caltech and that the UW CS department is getting a lot of funding."" 

Also by funding, I meant that UW is investing a lot into their CS department and they are hiring a lot of renowned professors who have significant publications."

We have an idea for utilizing our engineering colleagues to help us out.

Our problem is specifically how to minimize risk for viral transmission during airway management. Intubation is amongst the highest risk procedure for these patients, yet is necessary in critical patients. A Taiwanese anesthesiologist came up with a design for a simple cheap box for cleanable particle limiation. Please see the following for a basic schematic: https://sites.google.com/view/aerosolbox/design

I think it could be done better, and if engineered to be produced at scale could save a lot of healthcare workers. Please let me know if anyone on this subreddit would be interested in helping.

Thank you.
Brian Hondorp, MD

Edit:
Wow! Thank you everyone for responding, I wasn’t sure I’d get any responses.

Here are where I see the current limitations with this design:

1) Arm range of motion. Some patients, particularly those with “difficult airways” require more manipulation of the head in order to achieve a sufficient laryngoscopic view for intubation. A modification that allows for greater range of arm motion, particularly in the vertical dimension, while maintaining minimal aerosol exposure would be great. Specifically, the arm motion that would be limited by this box is head and neck manipulation to allow placing the patient in the “sniffing” position.

2) The top seam on the working side is in the direct line of sight. While not a deal breaker, it would be preferable to have ability to see through a clear panel that is perpendicular to line of sight, rather than potentially needing to look through a seam. Perhaps an angled panel would help? 

3) The bottom of the box is entirely open. It is necessary to have space to accommodate a variety of chest circumferences, as well as having space for an assistant to hand the Endotracheal tube, circuit, etc.  However, this potentially exposes assistants or other staff standing nearer to the foot of the bed to higher viral loads. I think an ideal solution would seal the bottom without being rigid. A surgical gown (or even a blanket) could be draped over the bottom for this purpose, but increases disposable costs and setup time. Is there a simple way to avoid this while providing better isolation for the bottom of the box than open air?"

Experiences with FSRI?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/fgjyjs/experiences_with_fsri/,11,6,2020-03-10 19:58:37,"Hi! Hope all is well for everyone. I’m new to Reddit but was lurking here for a while as an excited pre-frosh and ultimately decided to create an account because I saw that some people have really recommended FSRI, and the summer 2019 report listed quite a variety of fun research project focuses, so I just wanted to learn more details about the experiences anyone has had with it. 

-What was your experience like with FSRI? 
-Was there anything that surprised you about the program?
-Did you have some research experience in high school beforehand and if so, how does it compare to that? 
-Did you find it helpful in setting you up for life as a Techer? 

I understand that only around 20 people participated in the summer 2019 one, so I apologize if I’m looking for a needle in the haystack; any and all insights and wisdom would be much appreciated.  Thank you!"

I'm super excited to have been accepted to Caltech for early action. I'm having a difficult time making up my mind, and I had some reservations about Caltech due to the mixed things I read on the internet. :( Could you guys give me some advice, and perhaps answer some questions I had?

1. Mental health? I read on a random thread from a while back that depression was pretty widespread at Caltech. Is this true? Do you guys think that someone with preexisting mental health issues would heavily suffer at Caltech? I'm usually a very bubbly and extroverted type of girl. However, I unfortunately have some issues with cutting. I am genuinely working on improving my mental health, and I am planning to seek help soon, but mental health was one of the reasons I felt unsure about Tech.
2. The rigor? Is the work at Caltech ""do-able"" with hard work? I've read in many places that Caltech is genuinely a humbling experience. Personally, I don't really consider myself the smartest in school. I've met far more people who are smarter in my high school journey. Although I did well in my IB program and had good test scores, I'm much more of the ""hard-working type"" than the ""naturally smart type"" (if that makes sense). I'm more than ready to be humbled by my brilliant peers, but I'm honestly worried: Will a hardworking student who is not the typical ""genius"" type be okay at Tech? Sometimes, it seems like Caltech is a place for geniuses, and I feel quite intimidated.
3. Not having free time? On average, how much sleep does a Caltech student get? How much free time did/do you guys have?
4. Fitting in? At Caltech, would I still be able to find people who are pretty chill and down to earth? I was a little intimidated by how ""nerdy"" some of the kids I met on the accepted student discord were, haha.
5. Social life? Do you still find time to socialize with others? Also, coming from a very small town in the south, I love that Caltech is near LA. Do you have time to explore LA and to go into the city?
6. Do you regret it? Do you regret choosing Caltech?

Apparently they are interested in a wide array of technological innovation when it comes to either user-experience in their aircraft, or operating capabilities of their aircraft. 

When I saw the event it piqued my interest because my research (I'm a grad student in CMS) involves optimization problems with applications to aircraft design. While it's not realistic for me to be a part of this endeavor (I'll be doing research at a mathematics institute Germany during key phases of the competition), I figured it may be of interest to GALCIT people.

But, It is not suited for every admitted student. Admissions does a good job. But, they are not perfect. 

It is a perfect fit for some students but absolute torture for many.  

Do not expect a typical undergraduate experience. 

Commit to Caltech if you enjoy real hard work, if Science and Research brings you pure joy, if you do not need typical college social life.

Do not commit to Caltech if you are not willing or cannot do real hard work, if you are a brand name chaser, if you have any signs of mental health issues. 

Caltech is well known only in Science and Research communities.  Do not get offended if general public/friends/relatives do not recognize it but your third cousin and your high school buddy gets pat in the back when they mention their average school. 

Do not think of transferring after freshman year if you do not like it. It is not going to happen in almost all the cases.

When they say it is a hard school, better believe it.

I got some super heated responses and inadvertently started a few debates, which really wasn't my intention, but was informative anyway. I honestly didn't get it at all as a prefrosh but now that I'm a part of Booty house, I totally do get why some people would feel like their house is a huge part of their life. 

I'm a semi socially awkward person (like most students here), but being part of a house really does mean free friendship and community. Unless you're unable to find any groups in the house you get along with, it's easy to have a circle that you can lean on. I will say that a lot of shit goes down in Booty house so it is kinda hard to get work done (sucks that I'm on grades next term) but the people in my house are basically my family. 

I don't know about the most work-conducive environment--I think that really depends on the house / residence too--but honestly being in a house let me meet people that are probably gonna be my friends for the rest of my 4 years here. I'm still worried about grades and my GPA, and at times I wish I lived in a less rowdy house. I can definitely see why being alone at breakdown hour would be awful, and I can also see why a lot of people in Booty house basically only do work in libraries. There's still pros and cons to both living situations, but I think I understand them more deeply now. Basically, it's far from perfect, but I understand why people were defending the house system so hard back when I posted."

I'm a recently admitted Prefrosh who's looking to major in either ChemE or BioE. I was wondering if I could receive some advice on which to pick.

My goal is to develop and implement a more effective drug delivery system using nanorobotics; essentially tapping into the work of Dr. Qian and others and applying it to therapeutics. To do this I'd like to do research during the school year every year.

I'm struggling to pick between these majors because there are few cons to each of them from my perspective:

Cons of BioE:
- pays a lot less for just a undergrad degree, which is relevant to me because I need to pay down 80k of student loan debt between undergrad and getting a PhD. A lower paying job means more years between undergrad and PhD.
- Maybe be harder to get a job in the pharmaceutical industry between undergrad and PhD.

Cons of ChemE:
- I have to take a few courses Im not personally interested in.
- the courseload for ChemE is far more extensive, meaning that I'd have to take at least 5 courses every term for every term in my four years. I worry that this will impede my ability to get meaningful research done during the year. 

I know this is a long post so I appreciate any advice! Hopefully someone will correct a misunderstanding I might have in my cons list, or perhaps suggest an optional way forward.

I would like to know which of the following statements are exaggerated, which are true, and strategies for managing the latter.

&#x200B;

\- Little/No Free Time

\- Bad Administration policies (heard rumblings of this but don't know the specifics)

\- Prestige of the Caltech brand offset by a less-than stellar undergraduate GPA due to course difficulty (when applying for a job or graduate school) (I have heard people citing this when referring to Caltech as a ""huge gamble"")

\- Professors not focused enough on teaching due to being active researchers

\- Lack of social life / visiting LA and such 

\- Lack of safety-net

1. When do you usually sleep? On average, how many hours of sleep do you get each night?

2. What are the most active clubs on campus, especially pertaining to astronomy or aerospace? The amount of student organizations at Caltech seem significantly lower than most schools and only seem to be dwindling... does it feel that way?

3. How much background do freshman classes assume you have? Is it possible to do well with a below-average high school foundation?

4. Why did you choose Caltech? Was it worth it? If you have to cite a single reason for staying away from Caltech, what is it?

5. How are the humanities? Students I've talked to described the humanities as ""science lite,"" that economics is mostly game theory and history deals with the history of science. How true is that? Are there really no ""real"" and more traditional history classes?

6. How detrimental/ beneficial is Caltech for grad school admissions, especially for a middling student? Does Caltech accept its own undergrads to their grad school?

7. If you had the choice between MIT and Caltech, given everything you have experienced and ignoring weather, what choice would you make today? If that choice is between Stanford and Caltech, which would you go with?

8. What do you feel differentiates the House System at Caltech from residential colleges or dorms with strong dorm cultures at other institutions?

I'm competitive enough to work hard to deliver a substantial number of results relatively to my peers, but I hate to sacrifice quick, day-to-day activities that make me happy just to appease my boss or work culture.

My question is, how do you make sure the pumpkin does not crack before it is dropped? Every time I freeze something in LN2, there is a nearly 50% chance of it breaking in two or more pieces. (and it is not like it is a turbulent environment due to boiling, it is a good Dewar, so once the object cools, the LN2 has minimal convective currents) 

Would putting a hole in it so that it can freeze more uniformly help? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

What sort of student does Caltech look for?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/9ebr8a/what_sort_of_student_does_caltech_look_for/,4,2,2018-09-09 09:19:20,"*Background*


Hi! Im a HS senior, and I'm considering applying EA to Caltech next month. From what I've read in guides, seems like a good fit for me, I like small classes and theoretical physics, it seems like a suuuuper nerdy school which is a huge plus for me (only super-nerd at my school, gets lonely). I read somewhere that y'all will talk about weird and wacky physics over dinner and that was the point at which I was like yup this is me. 


*Question*


But before I use an early on it, I just want to know your opinion and what sort of student would be a fit for Caltech. I want to know for two reasons:

1. Am I a good fit?

2. If so, what aspects of myself should I highlight on my app, for example, I have two essays rn, one about growing up as a maker, and the other one about fighting obesity and losing a lot of weight, so if Caltech really cares about continued interest in STEM above all, I might go for the former, and so on

I hope this makes sense and that my head is in the right place in thinking about college admissions. 

Thanks in advance. Go Beavers!"

SURF Advice for a UK student,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/9darsv/surf_advice_for_a_uk_student/,1,1,2018-09-05 20:45:47,"Hi I'm planning on applying for a SURF internship next summer. So I would like to ask for some advice.

I'm a 3rd year undergrad (just finished second year) on a Maths and Physics course at a university in the UK. I'm currently doing a similar program to SURF at my own uni, with a particle physics professor, so I do have some relevant experience. I finish on the 7th. I've asked if he knows anybody at Caltech but he says he doesn't, but he suggested that one other professor might so I'll email him soon. 

I'm more interested in the theory side of particle physics so would prefer to work in the particle theory group but would be open to the experimental side too.

The particle group at my uni is relatively young but has a good reputation and has it's hands in pretty much all the major experiments going on around the world. My current supervisor is also fairly well known (I think but my only experience is at my own uni so that might bias me a bit) but he and the group are established enough that I think the Caltech professors will be aware of them.

So if anybody has experience applying to SURF from outside the US or even just from a uni outside of Caltech any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also any advice about SURF/the particle professors from someone at Caltech would be good too. I'm particularly interested in how to go about picking a supervisor and since Caltech doesn't provide funding how likely it is the professor will be willing to fund someone they've never met.

I'm interested in applying to Caltech, but I'd like to hear from current students about how life on campus is.

Some questions:

1. Is there a strong gaming community?
2. How social are Caltech students expected to be?
3. What do you do in your free time (i.e. any time that's not spent at class or doing classwork), and how much free time do you have?

That must now change. This past Friday I pointed out to a friend that it contains an absurd expression ""sqrt(-1) * (Pv / nR)"". Ah yes, the famous ""i * T"" ... expression. Well, that was not the entirety of the expression. See, right next to ""sqrt(-1) * (Pv / nR)"" was ""E / c^2"", and what happens when we subtitute ""m"" for ""E / c^2""?

We get ""mit.""

Both have small class sizes and close faculty-student relationships, though CalTech obviously wins in that regard. CalTech also doesn't accept any AP credit whereas given my current situation I could be entering SLO with sophomore standing.

Any current students at CalTech, I'd seriously appreciate any feedback about why I should choose CalTech, because this is one of the most important decisions of my life up to this point.

"Tough decisions, Berkeley or Caltech?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/88ev8y/tough_decisions_berkeley_or_caltech/,5,16,2018-03-30 23:57:55,"Saw a similar post on here and having a tough time choosing where to go for undergrad CS+Math double major. Obviously some blatant differences are size and diversity of departments, but at this point I want to get into the nitty gritty, things only Caltech students would know. I'd really appreciate if anyone could answer some of these questions:

What are some things about Caltech that you love/hate and why?

How do you feel about the size of Caltech? I don't really know if I'd enjoy how small it is, since I've never attended.

Do you ever get bored in Pasadena? Is there a lot to do outside of campus?

Are there strong campus events, clubs, and activities? 

How bad/good is core?

Is the dismantling of the House system really going to affect the quality of the school?

Is it easy to get internships and job opportunities?

How is stress culture and mental health at Caltech?

Do you think there's anything unexpected I should consider (i.e. not mentioned in any of these questions) when choosing between these schools?

Thanks in advance for any responses.

EDIT: really want to double major math/cs"
"I did bad in undergrad, but I have research experience. I'm trying to go to Caltech grad",https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/823jpi/i_did_bad_in_undergrad_but_i_have_research/,6,17,2018-03-05 05:02:12,"I wasn't the best student in undergrad. I went to NYU and got a BS in biology with a 3.2 GPA.... I had some issues back at home. I also had a 2.8 slump for 1 year, but tried to finished with a 3.861 GPA the next semester, so overall was a 3.2...... 
My GRE was pretty bad too- 316. 

I know it's below Caltech standards. 
The only good things I have are - a published paper in Nature. I worked 50 hours per week, slept in lab, and had help from a phd mentor. The PI was also understanding and he let me sleep in lab. 

I was named 5thco-author for the paper, with 9 other authors lol. 

Anyway, I wanted to go to Computation and Neural Systems PhD because I like the faculty research. I like reading their papers. I have some ideas to contribute to my own. But I am worried about the course work to survive. I am worried that I might wash away. 

But most likely, I won't make it to PhD, especially at Caltech. I know its a huge long shot. 
I barely have the physics, computer science, or math background to make it.
My bio background is sufficient, but really shakey and bad.
Here is what I took in undergrad: 

* Physics: Mechanics, Intro Electricity & Magnetism, Waves & Optics
* Computer Science: Intro to Python, Object Oriented C++
* Bio: Bio 1, Bio 2, organism physiology, anatomy, genetics, molecular development, grad level neuroscience, grad level tissue culture and engineering 
* Math: calc 1, calc 2, calc 3, linear, differential, and numerical methods
* Chemistry: chem 1, chem 2, orgo 1, orgo 2, [lecture and labs], biochem 1, biochem 2, analytical, physical chemistry, 
 
I was thinking about going to do a mathematics and computer science masters to try to overcome the slump and to catch up. 

But if I do get a 4.0 GPA <kinda long shot but one can dream> on my master, I was wondering if my undergrad GPA will still weigh me down. 

Any thoughts? Any advice? Any career suggestions? "

"Caltech's defining undergraduate feature, the House system, has just been unilaterally dismantled by administrators.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Caltech/comments/7uo29s/caltechs_defining_undergraduate_feature_the_house/,91,67,2018-02-02 02:12:13,"This morning, Vice President for Student Affairs Joe Shepherd released a housing plan that, on pages 7-10, puts an end to Rotation (and therefore the House system) as we know it.

Upperclassmen will no longer be involved in the sorting of freshmen into Houses, and the freshmen’s preferences will be the sole determining factor in their assignment. The explicit goal is for freshmen to ultimately choose where they will live before they ever arrive on campus.

The verdict was made unilaterally and inserted at the last minute to a housing plan years in the making. The students who were involved in the plan's creation were not notified of the change until late last night. You can read the document for yourself here https://studaff.caltech.edu/documents/71-bechtelplan-2-1-2018_final.pdf (Rotation material starts on page 7.)

The House system is the foundation of undergraduate excellence at Caltech – our honor code, our academic success, and our recruiting efforts depend on it. House communities are also a critical part of the mental health safety net that keeps Techers sane and alive.

A threat to the House system is a threat to the continued existence of Caltech as a first-class undergraduate institution, and an affront to the entire Caltech undergraduate and alumni population.

This is likely the biggest threat the House system has faced since its founding in 1931.
