Visiting for UNC game (neutral fan); Am I missing anything?,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostoncollege/comments/1gwkvhm/visiting_for_unc_game_neutral_fan_am_i_missing/,12,16,2024-11-21 17:28:57,"Hello Eagles,

I'm a Florida-based guy who travels all around the country to watch college football games and take in each school's unique way of experiencing the best sport on the planet. I'll be arriving in Chestnut Hill on Friday to check out the game against North Carolina, my first time seeing a game at Alumni Stadium (although I did walk through Alumni Stadium prior to the Army-Navy game last year).

I typically compile a pretty in-depth list of things to do around town, places to eat & drink, and info about the gameday experience, but if there are any great food spots, cool dive bars or breweries, beloved campus-area institutions, campus highlights, or gameday traditions (the weirder the better) that you feel are can't-miss experiences, I would love to learn about them and make sure I don't overlook something important.

My plan is to spend Friday and Saturday focused primarily on BC and the Chestnut Hill area, then maybe hit a couple of spots in the wider Boston area on Sunday before flying out late. So I'm more interested in stuff near campus that would be part of the typical BC student/alumni experience, but if there's something uniquely Boston (for example, I only recently heard about steak tips being a unique local food item) that I should check out on Sunday, I'd love to hear those recommendations too.

Also, if there are any cool or even dumb/goofy cheers, traditions, marching band performances, etc. that may fly under the radar, I'd love to know about them.

Essentially, my goal is to cram as much of the college/gameday experience into one weekend as I can, so whatever you think may help me accomplish that, feel free to douse me in nostalgia of the places you loved during your time on campus. 

Anyway, sorry for the long post. I look forward to hearing any tips y'all may have!"

She goes to a pretty nice public school in MA and from what I know, her GPA is 4.0 unweighted (4.06/4.33) up til junior year. She also took a lot of AP courses and did pretty well in them. Her SAT superscored is 1510. She doesn't have many academic awards (besides honor roll and AP scholars with distinction), but she leads two clubs and participates in a lot of volunteer service.

From what I know, she's really stressed because she is currently taking AP Calc BC, AP Physics C, and AP Psych. She is doing well in Calc BC and Psych, but she's terrified because of her low Physics C grade. She's thinking she could get anywhere from a low C to a low B.

If so I have no issue applying as a finance or business analytics major, but if so would it be easier to pick up a dual major in computer science? Further on the academics, as someone who is interested in going into finance, I was curious as to what the on campus recruiting scene was like, and if there were any companies that favor BC students. I would ideally love to work in Boston or New York City at a big firm and was wondering how doable it is out of BC, as I know the Carroll school of management is very respected in the finance world. Also I heard about the way BC has its dining plan set up, and as someone who eats what I would consider above average, given I am a pretty tall person, I was curious what current students felt about the way you have to buy everything from your set balance, and it’s not really a swiping system that is seen from most colleges? I just wanted maybe some insight as to like what people maybe like and don’t like. If anyone has anything about the school in general please feel free to share. Thanks."
Transfer from Syracuse??,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostoncollege/comments/1fxneqr/transfer_from_syracuse/,1,0,2024-10-06 18:36:14,"I'm a current freshman at Syracuse University who's thinking about transferring to BC. I'm curious how much partying there is at BC and what the people are like. A large part of what I don't like at Syracuse is how much partying there is (3-4 nights a week) and also the people. In my opinion, the average Syracuse student is an unintelligent frat guy who talks with your stereotypical frat accent and doesn't care about anything but partying and sports. What is your average BC student like? Are people nice? Are people from cities? Are people smart and academics are taken seriously? Additionally, I'm Jewish, so how religious is BC actually?

I'm a very social person and one of the selling points of BC to me I think is how many college students live in Boston, and that brings with it it's own culture separate to other universities in the US. So something I'm wondering about is the frequency of intersection socially between BC students and those of other universities in Boston such as BU, MIT, Harvard, and Northeastern. Is it common for BC students to meet, spend time, and go to social events with students from other universities, or do they tend to stick to their own cohorts? Also what's the relationship between BC and other Boston schools, are there stigmas, stereotypes, how do students from other schools view BC, and does it affect the social scene?"

I went online to check into the prices. $600 for an Upper Brighton tailgate pass for that game. Upper Brighton isn't even a premiere lot; that price tag is actually laughable. It makes other big time college football fans laugh at us. SIX HUNDRED dollars to park for one game?

I understand BC has logistical challenges with tailgate operations and the city of Boston. We had full-season tailgate passes for several years after graduating. But the reality is, the Upper Brighton lot is never full. Like, ever. The most occupied I've ever seen it for tailgating is probably \~60% of spaces occupied.

Do the powers that be understand how crippling this is to generating widespread interest in BC football? At a reasonable price tag, the tailgate lot could be populated, fun, and drawing interest in this team. It's pretty sad, with such an exciting team potentially on the horizon.

My math grades are not very high and I’m only taking calc ab this year, so I think it’ll be harder to get admitted as a finance major compared to another concentration like general management. 
2. How are the dining halls and dorms? I heard that some BC dorms are not very nice, so it’ll be nice to hear some more insight into that. Are there good food options in the dining halls and around the local area, and how are the meal plans?
3. What is the social scene like? Is it hard to make friends and how easy is it to be invited to parties? Are the parties fun and what you expected of the college experience? 
4. Are there things to do around the local area or do most people go to Boston during the weekends? 
5. Is the academic environment more collaborative or competitive?
6. Does BC give good financial aid to low income students? I know that they meet 100% of need with loans, but are the loans a large part of the financial package or is it mainly need based aid?

I'm an incoming freshmen to BC and pretty excited but I guess something kind of like frightening and almost annoying to me is that i've realized some girls have already sort of started to form friend groups just by meeting people online. I guess maybe I haven't put as much effort into this as I should've bc i was just expecting to meet people once I get there (I feel like this so normal). I feel this way because I've heard of group chats of girls going to BC and i've seen instagram posts of girls already meeting each other and hanging out. also a ton of them comment on each others posts and it's like so obvious hei to tell who's already part of these groups. I guess I just want to come on hear and ask if this has happened in past years/ if these groups stick and remain cliquey. I guess I'm just kind of discouraged and this makes me scared people already have friends and I'll end up friendless. Any input would help :)

I am wondering if anyone has had success getting in this late? I don’t want to ask for recommendations if they just want my $85 and will straight out deny me. 

It also adds complexity because I would most likely ask a professor in my current program for a recommendation which feels uncomfortable since I haven’t told them I might not continue. I would only apply if I knew I actually had a chance please help!!!

“Students are responsible for ensuring that sealed official copies of transcripts from Summer courses taken outside BC are delivered to student services. Only courses for which a transcript grade of C minus or higher is earned and for which a course pre approval form has been properly completed and approved will be eligible for posting to the student’s record. “

Help me decide between BC and Rochester,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostoncollege/comments/1cdz1f4/help_me_decide_between_bc_and_rochester/,5,22,2024-04-26 22:49:37,"So I’ve gotten into both Boston college and university of Rochester for Mathematics and physics, and I’m very stuck deciding between the two.

On the one hand, Rochester has an open curriculum and plenty of math and physics courses that I can take, meaning I can really dive deep into all the material I find super interesting. Additionally they have an unbelievable emphasis on research, enough so that I can get 4 years of research on top of being able to take lots of graduate courses due to the open curriculum. As I want to go to grad school, this is crucial. At the same time, I worry about the weather and the overall environment of the school. I’ve always handled the cold and rain well, but I don’t want a dreary social environment. Similarly, I worry the people who go might be too academically driven, of course this is how I am, but I’d want an environment that’s more colorful than a bunch of  hard working kids. Lastly, I toured inside of the math and physics departments and they are abysmal, seemingly no personality with almost no posters or any real excitement that I would like to see. Then again I went on a Saturday.

For Boston college it is almost the opposite. I wont be able to pursue as in depth to my classes due to the tight curriculum, however then again the general philosophy of education there is something I appreciate much more- it may help me greatly to expand my perspectives and really engage with other subjects. The campus is lovely and the people seem more socially diverse and friendly. However I most specifically worry about the physics department, and the research opportunities all around, it seems a lot less accessible and sufficient compared to Rochester. 

Generally, I feel like at Rochester I will do better academically and be more able to pursue the subjects I’m very interested in. However at BC I also respect the overall social scene better as well as the required classes. 

Any help would be much appreciated,
Thanks."

2. My interest in psychology grew in tandem with my interest in philosophy. I hope to continue exploring both of these interests as a graduate student by continuing to consider and discuss the human condition; ""Who am I?"" ""Why am I the way that I am?"" ""Who are we?"" ""Why are we the way that we are?"" ""How can I learn to cope with all of this?"" are questions I long to keep asking. For this reason I have been drawn to psychodynamic models of therapy (as well as humanistic and spiritual ones). **I was wondering how you would describe the program's philosophy or emphasis?

Additionally, I’m really taking into consideration school spirit and their dance teams. It may be a bit random but I’m very into dance (hip hop) and I know that BC really funds their dance organizations but I’m not so sure about UT.

Anyone have any information regarding whether BC’s CS is good? I’d be willing to go but that’s the only thing holding me back (I have a fear of ending up homeless) I want secure job opportunities 😭😭 "

I do enjoy parties occasionally but I need plenty of quiet and space for studying as well and excessive partying/drinking/smoking is not something that I find ideal at this time of college. I'm generally introverted so I feel as though people will look down on me as soon as they find out that I'm in Walsh. I'm also not sure if the ppl in this dorm are all that welcoming, especially since I don't look like the type of person who would party or socialize a lot (if that makes any sense). I was also informed that the conditions of the dorm are NOT ideal at all whatsoever (as in extremely disgusting) and that by being in this dorm, I'm essentially wasting my sophomore experience for good

Basically what I'm wondering is if Walsh Hall is better than CoRo at the very least and if I will be in essentially what my friends from Stayer consider ""1 year of pure hell/prison"". I was thinking that worst case (since obviously there's nothing I can do abt it now) I can opt to move to Vanderslice or smth in the first 2 weeks if it's really as bad as ppl make it out to be (granted, if they even have any space left) or switch to off campus housing but I heard that doing so still means that I will have to do off-campus junior year which essentially means 2 years of off-campus housing which is also not ideal"

***The real dilemma is that I am a black woman and LGBTQ+***. My family is not wealthy and I'm extremely tall. I was excited about going to college and meeting other POC and queer individuals. But recently I heard that BC is less than 4% black and does not allow LGBTQ clubs. I already think that this school might not be the right fit for me, but I do not want to let the coaching staff down.

Many other schools have offered me.. what should I do? I need help! Does anyone have any advice?"

Need Help with Academic Suspension Appeal Letter,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostoncollege/comments/18zkde7/need_help_with_academic_suspension_appeal_letter/,18,9,2024-01-05 23:02:13,"
Hello to the people of the BC subreddit. I was suspended for being in a severe credit deficiency. I was wondering if anybody would be able to proofread my appeal letter. I feel like I get generic at points. I’ve been told it’s long but it seems like it’s a similar length to others I’ve seen. If you feel it is long, pls lmk what I can do better! Also curious about those who have appealed successfully. Thank you in advance! (I am freaking out)



To whom it may concern, 

My name is XXXX, and I am a Junior in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences studying Neuroscience. After the conclusion of the Fall 2023 semester, I was informed of my academic suspension from Boston College. I understand my credit deficiency is significant, and I understand and take full responsibility for the decision that was made. I would like to have my academic standing taken into reconsideration and shed some light on some circumstances which I feel had an impact on my academics. I write this letter to show that there is nothing more important to me than continuing at Boston College. 

Over the course of this break, I have utilized my time to reflect on where I went wrong in my past semester. I will concede I had a very difficult time this semester. I don’t intend to excuse my lack of credits, but I would like to take this opportunity to delve into a situation that arose between Spring and Fall of 2023. I would like to emphasize this is in no way an attempt at excusing my performance but rather to offer a more holistic perspective. In my spring semester last year, I was unsure of the direction I wanted to take with my academics, and with my course selection. Throughout the semester I traveled home a lot due to homesickness, and also general sickness (flu and covid multiple times throughout the semester) Despite general demotivation, I was on track to finish out the semester with a 3.7 GPA. Just a couple days before final exams, I was sexually assaulted by a trusted friend. Though I did not want my failures to be the result of an individual, I missed some final exams due to being severely depressed following the incident and mistakenly did not reach out to professors to see what my options were. When summer came, rather than seek professional help, I drowned myself in two jobs and 7 credits worth of summer courses. I took General Chemistry 1 and 2, receiving an A- and an A respectively, though I have had some difficulty submitting my transcripts. This was also a difficult venture as during the summer I actively grappled with an eating disorder. Starting the new semester, I even began receiving nasty messages from fellow students on the basis of me being a muslim student in reference to a current global conflict. Going into my fifth semester of college, I recognized that I was struggling, so I made the decision to meet with Dr. XX, who referred me to University Counseling Services. I started going to classes again, as well as submitting my assignments. I got back on track with my courses but in the final weeks of the semester I was found by the same individual and once again assaulted, rendering me unable to complete most of my courses. Dejected, I fell out of contact with counseling services. 

Since getting home, I have been seeing my local therapist and been involved with sexual assault support groups. I have come to the realization that keeping my problems to myself is unproductive and so if given the opportunity to continue next semester, I first and foremost plan to be on top of things with my appointments with University Counseling services, which I found to be very helpful when consistent. I additionally plan to have more consistent communication with my academic advisor to ensure I keep up with graduation requirements. In terms of general academics, I will keep a planner with detailed descriptions of the assignments and tasks I must do day by day. My attempt to catch up was halted also by lack of organization. I will be improving my attendance with lectures as I came to the realization catching up was simply not possible after a certain amount of time. When given a second chance, whether it be with making up a test or an assignment, I will be ready to receive it. I will most definitely be making greater use of office hours among other resources provided to us as students, as it is very easy to become overwhelmed. Even before university, I tended to be scared face difficult ventures in fear of failure, hence my number of withdrawals. I have also since found a career path I am passionate about and regained my passion for my declared study path. I have already taken a look at the syllabi for my spring semester courses and I am determined as ever to continue my bachelor’s degree and the Pre-Physician Assistant path. Additionally, I plan to take between 6-9 credits this summer, among which I am planning on taking Anatomy 1 and 2, as well as Organic chemistry. I had discussed arrangements with the Head of the Chemistry department for which institution would be accepted. I feel that this plan is feasible given how I performed on past summer science courses. I truly believe the plan I have laid out will produce positive outcomes if I am given the opportunity to return. 

I would like to conclude by saying my low amount of credit hours which led to my suspension does not reflect who I am as a student. I know with confidence this semester is not indicative of what I can do and I would like to bring my renewed determination to MCAS.  I request once again the opportunity to have my suspension reconsidered so I can return in the fall and truly prove that Boston College did not make the wrong decision in offering me a spot. Thank you for your consideration in this appeal. I hope to hear from you soon. 

Thank you,

Current 12th grader here, I'm just having anxieties over a school I haven't even gotten into yet (I applied ED1 so I'll know around the 15th, but I've been told I have good stats for it.)

I'm someone who doesn't really know what I want out of college. I guess I got excited I could still be an engineer like I told everyone without having to feel forced to let go of the more artsy things I love. (I have a huge love for theater, and plan to minor or double major in it.) This feeling was only reinforced after reading the course catalog for the program. I also trusted what the website said about it becoming accredited in 2025, and I'd be a 2028 graduate. As for the college itself, I enjoyed the lack of Greek life, the suburban feel of where it was in relation to the city, and everyone I interacted with seemed nice. (I'm aware of the stereotype. I've been going to Catholic school for years. I'm used to the crowd, despite not usually fitting in with them.) 

I've just been given a hard time over my choice to apply ED here. That I'm wasting my time by not doing a ""real"" engineering program at a better school, or that I'll be outcast for my sexuality or interests.

Sorry for the ramble, but I just wanted to ask: Is this true? Am I wasting my time in a ""fake"" program? Will it really be that hard to find people I fit in with? Any input is helpful, thanks to whoever reads this."

This is a very niche post but let me explain - I go to Drexel and I am going abroad to UPF in Barcelona this winter term. BC is one of the only other American schools that is a part of the abroad program and I am in need of someone to split a two-bedroom flat with (studios/one-beds are crazy expensive). I'm born and raised in New Hampshire so chances are I could swing by and meet up before we even go abroad. So ***please*** if you know someone in the program at BC who might be interested in rooming please send them my way.

A little about myself:

My name is Ian and I'm a pre-junior (Drexel is weird, I'm essentially 3/5 done). I’m studying Marketing, Esport Business, and Brand & Reputation Management. I’m a gay man (like in a serving cunt at all times, drag-race stan, eat hot chip way), an ex-fraternity member (with those remaining alcoholic tendencies), alt-adjacent, a Kim Petras lover, anti-capitalist, studio ghibli enjoyer, usually baked, a certified happy hour enthusiast, streaming Rush by Troye Sivan, and living my himbo dreams in college.

I’m looking for roommates with similar “fuck it we ball” mindsets, who are always down to drink and go out because it’s five o’clock somewhere, who want to put in the effort to make the apartment well-decorated, and willing to throw some of the best parties El Born (the neighborhood) has ever seen. I have no preference in terms of gender (but a queer individual is ideal). I’m envisioning themed cocktail nights, lots of beer-pong, gay bar crawls, and family dinners.

If we sound like a match, please feel free to reach out and we can exchange socials!"

Boston College Computer Science: Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostoncollege/comments/14lq48j/boston_college_computer_science_review/,44,28,2023-06-29 00:32:18,"TLDR - I'd give it a 6.8/10

To start I don't have any idea what it's like to run a university department or anything of the sort, so anything I say should be taken as such. Despite this, I do think this could help prospective students and maybe help bring some light to possible improvements to the curriculum.

I'm a current junior and have finished the CS major besides the Tech and Culture class. I have a SWE internship this summer at a FAANG company, but won't say which to maintain some anonymity.

Starting with the good stuff I want to say that the CS department has so many amazing faculty and so much great research is being done. Just recently it was announced that two of the faculty Professor Wei and Professor Kim received NSF grants. This just goes to show that the department has lots of talented people. As a side note I want to plug that Professor Wiseman is also amazing. If I was a prospective student this is the most important thing and exactly what you should look for at a school. Obviously, there will be some professors that are not as good, but that also comes with every department. As for the good stuff, I think this is really all that matters having good faculty is the most important part and BC has an advantage there.

As for the issues the first one the department doesn't prepare you well for interviews, whatsoever. Essentially, after CS1 where you learn Python you have to take it upon yourself to start preparing for interviews and expanding on your coding logic and knowledge, and to be fair this can be said of most majors. If I was not around so many CSOM students talking about internships sophomore spring, I'm not sure I would've focused so hard on landing one. The most beneficial thing for the CS department would be to run a semesterly event where they go over what students should be doing to prepare for internships. You would have to go over the different types of jobs you can get with the major i.e. SWE, Quant, etc., and then go over planning. This would include LeetCode, NeetCode, how often you should study, timelines, behavioral interviews, etc. This could also be student-run and I'd be happy to do it, but I would almost say it should be a requirement or heavily recommended.

The next big issue is with CS2. From what I've heard from friends and online CS2 at other schools is much more helpful. I'm not sure why BC feels the need to teach Data Structures in CS2. Half of the students that come out of CS1 barely have an understanding of the basics of programming and probably struggled on the final. What could be done instead is to take a different language (not Python or Java) like OCaml or C and dive deeper into the understanding of just regular programming, no data structures and maybe give a bit of OOD. This also removes the need for CS1 honors and allow students to place into CS2. I say OCaml because it really gives you an understanding of recursion and also is used at many high-paying companies like JaneStreet (Harvard teaches OCaml to their freshman and they are a feeder into JaneStreet). The reason I also mention C is because if the students have a good understanding of C they can go further in the Computer Systems class and probably do better in the class overall. I think Computer Systems is the class I learned the most in and is overall very important to matching the theory you learn in upper-level classes to the hardware.

With that update comes another issue which is the students have to learn data structures. Well the reason I say to remove data structures from CS2 is because students are so caught up with learning Java that they never truly understand the data structures. The best thing they could do is have a 3000 level data structures class required for all students. In this class you would learn about how the data structures are built, how they work, and how to solve problems with them. Then for homework and tests there shouldn't be obscure problems about the data structure or how the push and pop functions work. The students should be tested on how to solve problems with the the data structures using questions directly from leet code. The class should ideally be taught in Python because lets be real no one uses Java for interviews anyway. This class could single-handedly prepare students for interviews and this is already being done at other schools.

There are many 3000-level classes, like OOD, taught in Java that would have a problem with this change, but I honestly don't think it would be bad for them to include learning Java because they're too easy to begin with. These classes are often taken as gimmes by minors and majors alike this would add an extra challenge and maybe have some students take other electives.

Once again I would like to say I'm not an educator or consultant or anything of the sort, but as a student and customer of BC this is my input. BC Computer Science has so many amazing aspects, but I do believe that if these changes were made it could help students tremendously.

&#x200B;

Edit: It's also obvious that BC is trying to improve the CS major as I'm sure they know it is going to continue to be a big thing in the future. I think making changes like these would improve upon decisions made years ago when the CS department was still small and didn't need to prepare so many students."

1. Where is Kostka on a scale of feminist commune to sorority, and is it TERF-y?
2. Is the Healthy Living Community actually about literal health or just like being sober? The BC website is very vague about what ""health"" means in this context.

Time-sensitive: Call for BC subreddit moderators,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostoncollege/comments/144n3de/timesensitive_call_for_bc_subreddit_moderators/,18,3,2023-06-08 22:20:42,"Hey all!

Long-time sub member and current prime mod /u/forty_three here (class of '12)! Many of you may have seen the drama around the upcoming Reddit blackout that many subreddits are participating in, which starts June 12th. In summary: reddit is changing its policy in ways that will prevent 3rd party apps from being viable. If you want to learn more, check out /r/Save3rdPartyApps or read through [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/).

**How does that affect you?** I dunno. But it affects *me* (I primarily use 3rd party apps to access the site, and am not gonna migrate to the regular website, so I'll pretty much be gone from the site after July 1st) - and I'm one of the few still-active mods on this subreddit. But I don't want to abandon my BC peeps without warning. <3  
  
**Will /r/bostoncollege be participating in the blackout?** No. But only because I'm lazy and don't want to deal with figuring out how to actually make that happen.  
    
So, I'm putting out a call for new volunteers to moderate this sub.  
  
**What does moderating mean?**  
  
The expectations are pretty light - respond to modmail, report and remove spam, deal with uncivil comments, occasionally lock things down when salty BU students brigade us (I'm joking about it being BU, but - like all subreddits - we do occasionally get lightly brigaded by trolls, maybe once every year or two).  
  
If you're really passionate, you might want to update the community rules, change the subreddit settings, or try to attract more people from the BC community to join this forum.  
  
---  
  
I'm perfectly aware that this is a pretty quiet community, and has mainly become a place for people to ask for class recommendations (which I personally still think is extremely silly, because it's like... the _least_ efficient way of getting that info, haha - it's probably more effective to just scream your class rec questions out in the middle of ONeill Plaza - but people seem committed to giving it a shot here, which is harmless enough).  
  
The good thing about that is it means there's not much moderating to do. The bad thing is that, with one fewer mod, it means that spam traffic could pretty quickly overtake legitimate community discussions.  
  
---
  
**How do I join?**  
  
If you're willing to help us out, or have other questions, [message us through this form](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fbostoncollege&subject=[modapplication]&message=). Users with generally civil comment history & past BC subreddit engagement will have priority. Thanks!"

**Motions Referred to/Remaining in Committee:**

**Referred From Committee on Government Operations:**

* Adoption of new state energy code encouraging lower energy use and decreased carbon emissions. Passage now would result in implementation Spring 2024, delays in approval will cause implementation to take at least two years. A backlog of scheduled hearings means that if a hearing is scheduled it would be unlikely to pass the law before the deadline in July. Sponsor: Arroyo ([0606](https://boston.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6073266&GUID=927E3169-DF6F-4180-91BB-60F51D28C2C2)) **Vote delayed until next meeting.**
   * Councilor **Flaherty** noted the lack of public hearings and inquired about communication with unions representing builders. 
   * Councilor **Lara** responded by mentioning support from trade unions in exchange for city backing on building code legislation in the statehouse. She also clarified that the law does not require all electric construction but does require infrastructure to allow fully electric modifications.
   * Councilor **Baker** criticized the new code for requiring wiring for solar in most buildings as inefficient and misguided.
   * Councilor **Arroyo** mentioned that the requirements only apply to new buildings and research suggests they do not increase costs of construction. He also pushed for a vote.
   * Councilor **Fernandes Anderson** suggests a hearing.
   * Councilor **Bok** emphasizes the fact that most discussion of this issue takes place at the state level and that municipalities do not have the authority to adjust it.
   * Councilor **Murphy** recommended waiting because the process is rushed and she perceives some unions to be excluded from the process.
   * Councilor **Flynn** also expressed concern about the rushed process.
