Nah I‚Äôm legit so mad. My glasses broke and left a large red mark on my face.

Here I was minding my business listening to music. Next thing I see my life flashing before my eyes as this gorilla pounds my face. Nah cuz where in this school contract did I sign up to get clobbered by prime mike tyson. 

My fucking airpods fell too. So while I was recovering from seeing my ancestors damn near welcome me into afterlife, I was scrambling to find my airpod that fell in middle of a crowded bus all dizzy and shit. 

I swear my life was turned upside down in that moment I went home and started praying cuz I‚Äôm convinced that was divine punishment."

people with medical accommodations can only choose one roommate unless they have another person with it as well ,, (two med ppl + two normal ppl = one group) tbh, I am not 100% sure how this works, but that's what I heard from other people -- there is a full party of juniors got livi apt through medical housing so don't yell at me in the comments ""ohh you can't get livi as a junior""

dm me if you are

\- interested in living in livi apt or richardson apt if livi doesn't work out

\- gonna be a junior/senior? fall 2025

\- has medical accommodations (non-carpeted, ac, etc)

\^ this is preferred because I want to have a party of two medical two normal bc one medical three normal doesn't work out (?)

\- decently clean, doesn't smoke (weed, cig, anything smelly), responsible (taking turns throwing out trash, doing ur own dishes, cleaning ur room/bathroom/living room, not eating up the whole fridge)

\- has a decent sleep schedule / fine with me waking up at 7am sometimes

\- want to have a cute living space!!!!! omg let's decorate our apt haha

I‚Äôm a junior majoring in Finance with a CS minor, but I‚Äôm considering switching to a BAIT major with the same minor. I‚Äôm drawn to working on the tech side of business or in technology in general. Since it‚Äôs too late to switch to a CS major, BAIT seems like the next best fit, as many of its classes focus on programming and statistics‚Äîareas I prefer over Finance.

Switching would mean taking 5‚Äì6 classes per semester for the next three semesters, which feels intense. For context, I‚Äôve completed three Finance-related courses so far and would begin BAIT classes in the spring if I switch.

What are your thoughts, especially if you‚Äôve done a BAIT major? Is it worth it? How risky is it, considering the heavy workload (failing a class could set me back)? I'd really appreciate any advice!"

I really want to succeed in this program as I am so passionate about it, but I just feel so doubtful of myself. If anyone has any experiences they could share I would greatly appreciate it!!! "
What considers you a sophomore during class registration?,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/1gtux3k/what_considers_you_a_sophomore_during_class/,2,6,2024-11-18 02:53:04,"Hello!! So I'm a first year at Rutgers, and am going to register for classes tomorrow morning. I came into Rutgers with 28 credits. I understand that some classes have restrictions such as ""ONLY FOR SOPHOMORES AND JUNIORS"". According to what I saw online, Rutgers considers your year based on the amount of credits you have. If I'm not mistaken, sophomores are students with at least 30 credits. 

My question is: since I have 28 credits from before college and will complete 14 credits this semester, am I considered a sophomore for registration? Does Webreg consider your credits or actual time at rutgers as your year? 

I appreciate any insight!!"

How does it compare to genetics with Glodowski in terms of complexity of material and work required? If this helps in giving advice, I am a CBN major and have primarily taken classes that fall within the CBN requirements.

Please let anyone (girls) who needs housing in Rutgers know about this. I am subletting my current lease to someone else. Due to an emergency, I need to move out. All the details are below!!

Address: 290 George St, New Brunswick, 08901
Apartment: SoCam
Room: 1011 C (10th floor)
Rent: $1225/ month 
Lease: August ‚Äò24 - August ‚Äò25
Unit: 3 bedroom 

I have left some pretty furniture in the room for you to use~~ A chair, a lamp with good lighting (the main light is not good), and extra drawers! The view outside is also really pretty!! 

There are 2 bus stops right in front of the building, both are EE buses (college ave + cook/douglass route) but it‚Äôs relatively easy to get around campus. I lived here for 3 years and absolutely loved it. 

For anyone new to SoCam, the mail system is also very easy and there‚Äôs a gym and laundromat and other amenities.. (check the website: socam290.com)

Also!! There are 2 other rooms (2 other girls) in the unit, but one person does not even live there and the other person is only there on weekdays. So you basically get the whole unit to yourself for basically half the price of a single (studio) unit!! 

There‚Äôs also a grocery store right in front of the apartment, a convenience store, and so many shops down George Street. Everything you need is there!

Contact me (preferably through email) if you‚Äôre interested or for more details or even if you‚Äôre just thinking about it. The process is really easy!! My info is below:

CS Prerequisite Overrides Why,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/1gs2j4e/cs_prerequisite_overrides_why/,3,0,2024-11-15 18:04:38,"Is there a good reason as to why Math 300 with a B+ is a valid equivalent for CS 205, but not for registration purposes? How hard can it be to have this reflected on degree navigator or manually override upon request? (I'm assuming you can do the same thing as when transfer students get an equivalent class reflected on their degree nav). Why does it make more sense to email [prereqs@cs.rutgers.edu](mailto:prereqs@cs.rutgers.edu) that DAY OF your registration date for them to manually register you for the class? 

Even if you have enough credit to theoretically get the class you want, you're realistically one day behind in registration since they manage the prerequisite overrides at around 11AM when registration for the day opens at 9AM. And, since I need an override, I don't even have the opportunity to snipe these courses. Literally at the whim of the spn gods to get my CS classes as a junior. 

And now that Data Science is a major and also needs CS 205 for the major, doesn't it make sense to get rid of the prerequisite override? I feel like there are a good amount of Math + CS majors and seems like an easy fix. 

Anyone know why they can't try and fix this? Or if they will ever fix this?"

Hamidi gets a bad rep from a lot of people because she's not carefree like most professors. She expects students to put in the same effort that she puts into the class. When they don't, rather than ignore it (which most professors do) she calls it out. Most students who complain about her want a class where they can put no or the bare minimum effort, but that's no reason to call her a bad professor. 

Yes, her accent can be a bit tricky to understand. And I'm not a fan of her occasional pop quizzes. Required lecture attendance isn't fun but it's free points for just sitting there. But she gives extra credit and she tries to make sure everyone understands the material. Puts her at about the same level as a lot of profs here. 

Take it from someone who complained about her for a whole year and a half. 2 years later, I wish many of my professors were like her. 

Tldr; Many people have different opinions on Hamidi as a professor. You have to gauge whether she as a professor is a good fit for what you want from the class. If you're into participating and actively learning the material, she's a good professor and she'll recognize your effort. If you're trying to fill a requirement and don't want to put much effort (which is fair) either don't take her or suck it up for a semester. No need to badmouth any professor because their methods don't work for you. There's honestly more pressing things to worry about. "

I look around and everyone just seems to know what they are doing except me. the exam averages make me feel worse as well like if the averages are failing grades i think to my self how i will i ever pass??? Srsly and i think i am about to fail my first class (physics)  if i don't do well on the final.... 

& Brahmia (the physics prof)  said that less than 10% of the class fails  WHICH MAKES ME FEEL WORSE and makes me really rethink if i deserve to be here like i had a whole semester (2month so far) and i can't even learn phyiscs properly how much of an idiot am i?? 

Like what happens if i fail a class and have to repeat it i doubt any pharmacy school in the world would accept me right?? 

I don't know what it is is but if someone who did well on these classes (chem or phyiscs) can just give me tips i appreciate it.  because honestly if i fail 2 classes i surely just give up because i hate this feeling like do i just do book problems?? i just don't get it anymore lecture isn't enough

I normally don't post anything, but I thought this was important. I also apologize if this sort of thing is unwelcome on the subreddit. 

Apparently, there is a referendum that RUSA is trying to get passed. As I understand it there are two things they are trying to do:

1. Increase student tuition by $15 each

2. Gain the ability to increase fee increases every semester without the input of students.

I didn't even know this was happening until I received an email about it and I think that it is preposterous. As such, I urge everyone on here to vote ""No"" on this referendum in order to keep their tuition down and prevent RUSA from being able to increase student fees every semester without student vote.

I‚Äôll be starting my MSCS at Rutgers in January 2025, and I‚Äôm planning to focus on AI. I‚Äôm a bit unsure about which courses to take for my first semester.

I‚Äôm definitely planning to take the ""Intro to AI"" course with Professor Cowan, but I‚Äôm uncertain about the other two courses. I was considering ""Intro to DS & Algorithms,"" but I‚Äôve heard that Professor Abello can be quite tough, and I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a good idea for my first semester.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts:  
- Is Professor Abello‚Äôs course really that difficult?  
- Is it a bad idea to take it in my first semester?  
- Out of these options, which courses would you recommend for someone focusing on AI?  

Here are the courses I‚Äôm considering:  
- Mathematical Foundations of Data Science by Professor Cowan  
- OS Theory by Professor Kannan  
- Database Systems for Data Science by Professor Zhe Tang  
- Data Interaction and Visual Analytics by Professor Abello  

Looking forward to your advice!

I am a current freshman Computer Science major at Newark and I was wondering if it would be worth it to transfer to New Brunswick for the upcoming fall semester. I know the computer science department in New Brunswick is so much better but I was wondering if it would even matter to transfer. A friend of mine did make the point that if you want to go to graduate school (I do), there would be less competition and you would be able to stand out more in Newark if you get involved. In contrast, if you were to go to New Brunswick there would be so much more competition to get into these top programs and stand out amongst the big crowd. In addition, Newark has easy access to New York. Is transferring to New Brunswick for the top cs program worth it?"

Jameson bed bugs,https://i.redd.it/i8mwg37q450e1.jpeg,42,4,2024-11-10 21:16:56,"Minor rant about situation:

Its 2 rooms that are affected and they should not have self treated because now the treatments are less effective. They need to take some accountability and deal with the consequences. Not allowing me to post link so just read through the short article on the CDC website for bed bugs,,,

,,,

Okay, bigger rant (aka rah rah society and education bad {but not really})

I feel disappointed at the way rutgers students (and many other students at higher education institutions) dont challenge their views. 

We all like to say we are open to change but if you are only consuming information that agrees with yourself and completely disregarding everything else without understanding other perspectives, other information, etc,,, then you only wish to be ignorant (even if your views are ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù because you should be able to understand why other people think the way they do and think logically on why they are ‚Äúwrong‚Äù)

How does this tie in to the bed bugs??

If 1 (one) person posts something on reddit about bed bugs, dont just believe them. There was a post here a few weeks ago about a baby born on REXB and TOO MANY OF YOU BELIEVED IT. Clearly satire, yada yada. But your first instinct was just to believe it? Always hold some level of skepticism against everyone from children, to politicians, even to redditors (hard, i know),,,

And this skepticism should be with everything!! You wonder how [insert candidate, person, thing in your life you do not agree with] got into their current position and you need to realize people consume different media and grew up in different environments and have their own anecdotes for life,,, you should question everything and not blindly follow anything or anyone!! (May seem counterintuitive to say but also listen to people that are experts {like the pest control},, these people literally gain nothing from lying lololol)

What is supposed to set higher education student apart from the rest is that they are in a position to learn and be vulnerable, be willing to grow(!!!). 

We need to understand why we feel certain ways and always get our information from multiple sources and fact check ourselves and our beliefs. We shall not stray further from this point

Stay alive people,,,

Before I got the job I had the interview for this job but a day before I had an interview for another job. The other job is at the mall. Once I got to the bagel pace interview the manager gave me the job on the spot. Minimum wage and split tips between everyone. He said I could start the following week. The next day I got a call from the mall job. Same pay, no tips but 40 percent off of their clothes as it‚Äôs a clothes store. I accepted the job intending to call the manager of the bagel place that I couldn‚Äôt do training or work there anymore. Before I could work at the mall job however, I needed a background check. So I decided to wait for the background check before decking the bagel place job. Come Thursday, two days before I started the bagel place, I still hadn‚Äôt gotten the email for the background check. For context I didn‚Äôt call cuz my parents told me to wait until I got the background check, thinking that the place could offer the job to someone else. They thought that since I didn‚Äôt get the link yet the place wasn‚Äôt giving me the job anymore. Keep in mind that I had called the mall job and asked about the background check and they said they made an error so they corrected it the weekend after I started the bagel place job. The manager had already given me a schedule for the second week so I worked today and I work tomorrow. Today while I was at work I got a voicemail from the mall job saying to call back so we can set a start date. What should I do? Try to work at the bagel place and the mall job or quit the bagel place job? The thing is, i already started at the bagel place but im more inclined to work at the mall job because the benefits are greater, the tips I get per day are from 2 to 4 dollars at the bagel place while the mall job would give me more hrs, I get 40 percent off of their clothes and I would work 3 days instead of 2. The bagel place job is from 7-3 pm, is it advisable for me to work those hrs then an additional 5-7 hrs at the mall or should I just quit the bagel place job. I also feel really bad quitting almost 2 weeks in; I regret not calling as soon as I got the call from the mall job. Should I tell the manager that I don‚Äôt need payment for my time there if I do quit? And what should I text him if I do end up quitting? I also feel bad about eating at the bagel place for free, like I know those are perks of the job but I‚Äôm literally contemplating quitting barely 2 weeks in and might actually do it. I also got 2 free shirts and a visor to use as uniform? Should I return it? üò≠ Like I would quit over text cuz I‚Äôm terrible at confrontation. It‚Äôs an okay job and they‚Äôre still hiring. If anyone doesn‚Äôt have any job experience and want a straightforward job dm me and I‚Äôll text the place? ANYWAYS..What should I do? QUIT? Or work two jobs? I‚Äôm also a full time student taking 18.5 credits. Personally I have no job experience prior so I don‚Äôt know the procedure regarding leaving a job, especially a job I literally just started. I don‚Äôt want any bad blood between me and the manager cuz I would be haunted by the fact that I made someone upset or pissed off for months after the fact. My parents said for me to just say I‚Äôm leaving with no explanation cuz I‚Äôm allowed to leave at will but I would icky doing that. What excuse should I use? "

Outside the obvious fact being that asynchronous courses are done at the pace of the online instructor, while regular classes have their own time blocks throughout the week, are there any other significant differences? The credits shouldn't be any different, but are there any slight discrepancies between these two? For example, when looking at a college transcript, would there be a notation or any sort of distinction between an online and in-person class? For example, World of Insects is offered online but also has physical classes. Would either of these classes appear differently than face value because of the manner in which they were taken?

https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/s/RBb5nzNuPK

Given the red flag weather central New Jersey has been experiencing for the past little while and since rain seems few and far between according to the forecast, please try your best to save the water you use. 

Here are some tips we can all be aware of, in no order:
1) Don't use full blast water pressure when washing your hands or doing the dishes. Just use enough pressure where the least amount of water is wasted. 
2) Don't let the water run while brushing your teeth, it's a bad habit that I used to have many years ago. I imagine some of you still do this too. 
3) Don't pour water down the drain if there's other use for it (like giving it to a plant) 
4) Don't use water to defrost food from the freezer. Keep it in the fridge overnight, or use a microwave to heat things up. 
5) Don't use water when you're scrubbing dishes. Scrub, then rinse. 
6) Use the dishwasher when completely full. 
7) Use the appropriate settings when doing laundry
8) If you're poor like me and don't have a nice car, you don't need an exterior wash. Just wait for rain 
9) If you have leaks in your dorm, apartment, or at home, get them fixed ASAP
10) Controversial on this SubReddit, but try to take shorter showers. That's not to say don't shower at all, but try to take shorter showers. Turn off the water when you're applying soap to your skin. Turn off the water when you're conditioning / shampooing your hair. And don't just stand under the water because hot water feels good (I'm extremely guilty of this and something I need to improve on). Do your business, wash your hair, soap your body, rinse, and get out. Try setting a 10 minute timer in the shower if you're a long shower-er

Hope this helps! Let's save some water! "

We have to accept it now that Trump is going to be our president and it is going to be a major set back for climate change. Trump is planning to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement and disperse more oil companies resulting in an increase of harmful emissions. 

As helpless as we may feel, there are certain things we can do to make campus a healthier environment - I mean have you see the trash around college avenue? I am not saying let‚Äôs be trash collectors and pick up what was left by selfish people, however it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try to pick up a few pieces here and there. After all, if we all come together in little steps we can make a difference. 

 Here are some tips and resources that could make a step in the right direction:

1. Buy secondhand - I know it‚Äôs hard to get the things you need without having cars on campus but try not fall victim of overconsumption. One video I watched that was really insightful was ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v= ) I would watch this so you could grasp some perspectives. 
NOTE: In the physics building on Busch there are books, and binders for reuse! Buying school supplies every year is not only unsustainable, but pricy. All around campus you can find free school supplies such as pens, paper, and binders or folders.

2. Try to carpool - or walk. Do you really need to drive from one end of college ave to the other? You and your friend are both going grocery shopping? Then carpool. 
Near the college ave student center there is a farmers market, where you can buy fresh foods (which is more sustainable than buying from a large grocer).

3. Recycle! Come on guys we learned this in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL! reuse reduce and recycle. If you are using a pasta can why would you throw it out if you could wash it and reuse for storing leftovers. Here is a good link to recycling rules: https://www.epa.gov/recycle/how-do-i-recycle-common-recyclables

One fun activity you can do with your friend is making a recycled notebook, with all those papers we get from teachers and print for studying we can make a whole new journal: https://www.sumoftheirstories.com/blog/how-to-make-a-recycled-note-book?format=amp

4. Watch out for the products you buy. Many cleaners such as laundry detergent is dangerously harmful for the environment. There are alternatives, you just have to do the research. One good laundry detergent alternative is https://earthbreeze.com/?nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ax%3A18466727696%3A%3A&nb_adtype=&nb_kwd=&nb_ti=&nb_mi=&nb_pc=&nb_pi=&nb_ppi=&nb_placement=&nb_si=%7Bsourceid%7D&nb_li_ms=&nb_lp_ms=&nb_fii=&nb_ap=&nb_mt=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=18466727696&tw_source=google&tw_adid=&tw_campaign=18466727696&h_ga_id=&gc_id=18466727696&g_special_campaign=true&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAACi_yLt4B9-i2vTXBzT-j3g-r2xbi

Not only does laundry detergent contain harmful toxins for the environment, but think about the large plastic containers. Where do you think it all goes? 

5. Now there are so many more things we can do as students to live a sustainable life. I‚Äôm not saying do all of these but a little goes a long way. The best way to understand climate change and global warming risks are to be educated. READ about it and talk about it. I mean or don‚Äôt if you wanna live a life where your future kids can‚Äôt play outside like we once did. Do something

However, I‚Äôm not going in blind- I have some qualifications. I took AP calculus in high school and got a 4 on the exam so I got 4 credits for it. Pretty difficult class, and kind of hit me like a truck after absolutely breezing through every math class up till this course including pre calculus, but I managed to do quite well. You can‚Äôt cheat in math so this is pretty accurate in regards to my abilities. But im pretty terrified, especially for jobs. My high school didn‚Äôt require a science course for our senior year so I didn‚Äôt take one, so I‚Äôm lacking in the science department. I‚Äôm not exactly a genius in science either. But I took physics my junior year and it was basically algebra based physics so I breezed through it fairly easily. But that‚Äôs the part that‚Äôll fuck me over, the actual science part. For something like astrophysics I think you need to do some stuff outside of that to get a proper job, astrophysics is too ‚Äúbroad‚Äù.
