Missing Indoor Cat - South Davis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1gw971c/missing_indoor_cat_south_davis/,24,4,2024-11-21 05:42:57,"Hi Everyone,

I posted this so far on the Davis Lost and found Facebook group and Nextdoor app , now I want to hopefully bring forth to more people on reddit especially those who live on South Davis. We are concerned about Stoney who's an indoor cat thats been missing since yesterday November 19 around 6pm. I was hopping those who live around the Walnut Park area or even further out can keep their eyes out for Stoney! Here's a flyer with a bit more information about him and he should also be microchipped ! If you ever encounter him , there's a very good chance that he will also come to you if you call him .Thank you all for your time and effort ! :)

Strike on Thursday!,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1gw43yg/strike_on_thursday/,52,2,2024-11-21 01:18:44,"https://www.instagram.com/ucdafscme3299/

Today‚Äôs strike was a huge step forward! Students, workers, and allies came together to demand fair wages, better treatment, and affordable housing for all. But let‚Äôs be real: the fight isn‚Äôt over, and we need even more student and student worker support to make UC listen.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs at stake:

* **$7 billion of UC retirement funds** are invested in Blackstone, the biggest corporate landlord in the U.S., whose predatory practices drive up rents and housing debt‚Äîincluding for students.
* UC acknowledges housing costs are the largest contributor to student debt, yet they provide **housing assistance for executives making $500K+**, while leaving us and their workers to struggle.
* Service workers‚Äîthe folks who cook your meals and clean your spaces‚Äîare striking because they‚Äôre underpaid, overworked, and now face rising healthcare costs.

We need to show UC that their decisions affect all of us, and we won‚Äôt stand for it. Imagine if the billions funneled into Blackstone were used to create **affordable student housing** instead. What would it mean for your rent, your debt, and your future?

Here‚Äôs how you can support tomorrow:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Don‚Äôt eat at the dining halls if possible.** Show solidarity with the workers on strike. Food and water will be available at the protest spot!

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Join the picket line.** Even if it‚Äôs for 30 minutes, your presence sends a powerful message. 9 am to 1 pm will be the peak times.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Spread the word.** Share this post, text your friends, and tell them why this matters.

This isn‚Äôt just about workers‚Äîit‚Äôs about all of us. Together, we can push for a university that values its students and workers over corporate greed. Let‚Äôs make tomorrow even stronger. See you out there! ‚úäüèΩ

If your bike doesn't have fenders, get some. If you usually run your bike tires pumped to the max pressure, lower the pressure a bit so they can grip the road better. Or put on more knobby tires. Get your rain gear ready. Charge your stuff up in case power goes out. For those new to the Davis area, some areas do flood when it rains hard.

Has anyone transferred in with multiple different classes from different colleges with TAG or regular app? Does anyone have any advice for my situation? I really need all the help I can get, my dream is to come to this school and I don‚Äôt want a dumb counselors mistake to ruin it. PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!! "

Strike This Week!,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1guss04/strike_this_week/,226,34,2024-11-19 08:45:05,"[https://www.instagram.com/ucdafscme3299/](https://www.instagram.com/ucdafscme3299/)

Students and student workers, the Union needs you now more than ever! Right now, UC Regents have over $7 billion of our retirement funds invested in Blackstone, a corporate landlord that profits off skyrocketing rent, housing shortages, and evictions.

Blackstone owns 166 student housing properties, making them the largest student housing landlord in the U.S. For example, they own the U apartments. Their business model is driving up rent and debt for students while UC executives earning $500,000+ salaries get access to housing assistance programs. Meanwhile, the UC is doing NOTHING to address the crushing housing costs that are the biggest driver of student debt. This issue affects not only the students living in Davis but also the workers who need to live closer to their place of work.

So, ask yourself:

* What would it mean if UC invested in affordable, social housing for students instead of feeding billions to Blackstone?
* How much could your monthly costs go down if UC prioritized you over corporate greed?

üëâ Right now, career employees‚Äîcooks, food service workers, and dishwashers‚Äîare striking because the UC pays them poverty wages and expects them to do the work of 3 people. These workers are the backbone of campus life, yet they‚Äôre being treated like they don‚Äôt matter.

Yes, there might be limited food options (think fried food and pizza), but let‚Äôs not blame the workers who keep this place running. Instead, make your voice heard:

* Ask UC why they‚Äôll fund mansions for chancellors but won‚Äôt pay fair wages or invest in affordable housing for workers and students.
* Show solidarity with AFSCME 3299‚Äîshare our story, join our picket lines, or even just text UC leadership to demand change.

Together, we can send a clear message: the UC exists because of us‚Äîstudents and workers‚Äînot billionaires and corporate landlords. Let‚Äôs fight for a university that works for everyone, not just the wealthy.

It states this on the degree requirements page: 

* College Residence Requirement
* While registered in the College of Letters and Science, a minimum of 27 upper division units, including 18 upper division units in the major, must be completed on the Davis campus; work completed while registered in the UC Education Abroad Program or the UC Davis Extension Open Campus Program does not satisfy the College Residence requirements

Does this mean I need 27 upper division units total? Or does this mean I need 27 + 18 upper division units?

One of the key goals of my administration is to provide prevent budget cuts to essential programs and services that are utilized by students. As the University of California prepares for a quarter billion dollar budget cut next year and the Davis campus deals with its structural deficit, it‚Äôs important to have these conversations now.

The Causeway Connection is an interagency transit program that connects Davis to Sacramento and was created through a federal grant awarded to regional transit agencies during pandemic. For the past three years it has connected provided thousands of students and employees with sustainable transportation, but this could come to an end when the grant expires two years. At our monthly meeting with the Chancellor two weeks ago, the Vice President and I brought this up to campus leadership. They promised to find the funding required to allow the Causeway Connection to continue after 2027."

"GAME THREAD: #4 UC Davis vs #2 Montana State (De Facto Football Conference Championship.m 5PM, ESPN+)",https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1gsvf94/game_thread_4_uc_davis_vs_2_montana_state_de/,36,8,2024-11-16 19:51:49,"Today's the day! As posted in this sub multiple times this week, your UC Davis Aggies will take on unbeaten Montana State for a guaranteed FCS Playoff spot and at least a share of the Big Sky title today!

The MSU Bobcats have been among the best Football Championship Subdivision teams in the country the last few years, whereas the Ags have exceeded everyone's expectations and not dropped a game since a relatively competitive loss vs UCB in the season opener.

**Analysis / Players to Watch**

Montana State has the most productive offense out of all 129 FCS teams, though Davis is right up there with them at 5th. How they get there though is a different story: MSU's forte is the ground game where they're also the top rushing offense in the subdivision, whereas the Ags have the #4 passing offense led by one of the nation's most prolific quarterbacks in Miles Hastings.

Hastings and the Davis O will be trying to get the ball in different ways to Lan Larison, the #3 player in the country in all-purpose yards -- as well as WR/all-around athlete Trent Tompkins. Meanwhile, MSU will be leaning on its excellent running QB Tommy Mellott and its top-tier running back Scottre Humphrey. Davis' defense -- including newcomer David Meyer and two-way lineman Princeton Toki -- will need to lock down the Bobcat run game and keep pressure on Mellott while the pass defense including Kavir Bains and the Connors brothers will need to stop big passing plays.

One big story here is that MSU has had a weaker strength of schedule than Davis and indeed many of the best FCS teams. Davis will present a challenge to MSU that the Northern Colorados and Idaho States of the world don't, and the eyes of the nation will be on whether the FCS' second-ranked team executes against another top 5 opponent and/or UCD lives up to its resume.

This will also serve as a test of the culture of the school and fanbase -- can the Aggie faithful turn out and make Shredville a hostile ground in a late regular season game? Being able to keep 12K+ people in the stadium -- and loud when MSU is on offense especially -- could be a key difference-maker in enforcing the home-field advantage.

Men's Soccer slipped by Cal Poly in a dramatic fashion in the semis, beating the conference's top regular-season team on penalty kicks after a tie game. Next up are the #2 Gauchos, who are not to be underestimated given that soccer is one of UCSB's most high-profile sports.

Look for Zachary Neuls (the only Davis player to score against Santa Barbara this season) to keep his hot postseason scoring stint alive this game, and for forward Cason Goodman to add more to his team-high 9 goals. 

Offensive output in addition to a once-a-season defensive performance will be key because UCSB led the league in average scoring margin and was second in scoring defense in the Big West. Go Ags!

**Game Time:** 7 PM

**Stream:** [ESPN+](https://www.espn.com/espnplus/player/_/id/3833108a-c66c-4c8e-974a-a94b2e00527a) ($12/mo subscription, good for virtually all UCD sports including tomorrow's football conference championship *hint hint*)

**Zander's Prediction:** 2-2 Aggies, winning on penalties again"

I commute 45 minutes to Davis 5 days a week, so the bs on your website about how daily parking is cheaper and how paying for parking encourages public transportation is nonsense to me. Nearly all UC Davis professors take attendance so saying that remote class options reduce the need for monthly passes is also bs. I would pay almost $900 a year in parking, which means that 12 parking tickets over the 9 month school year is still cheaper than paying for parking.

I'd like you to tell me why a parking pass isn't even an option for students who commute from far away. Davis is expensive and not all students have the money to live here to take advantage of these ""public transportation"" options. Stop assuming all students live in Davis. Or maybe you should lobby to make mandatory attendance from commuter students an option so that we don't have to choose between eating and paying for parking."

MATH at UC Davis - STA013 ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1gri4wm/math_at_uc_davis_sta013/,4,3,2024-11-14 23:13:08,"So I'm currently taking STA013, and now that we're coming the end of the quarter, I'm honestly still so lost. I'm an international student who graduated from an IB school, where I took Math A.I. SL. I‚Äôm pretty average in math‚Äînot outstanding, but not terrible either. My grades have been okay, more than enough to pass. But right now, I actually feel like I‚Äôm failing STA013. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but when it comes to math, I usually expect lots of word problems and questions with numbers to solve.

In this class we‚Äôre required to memorize the exact wording from the professor‚Äôs lecture slides. I‚Äôm not really sure if this is helping me understanding math more or if it‚Äôs just killing my interest in it even more. Honestly, I‚Äôd rather take a test with 50 word problems than fill in the blanks. Personally, this doesn‚Äôt feel like a math class but it feels more like a memorization class.

If you‚Äôre in a different math class, is your test format the same? Do you also have to memorize every word from the lecture slides to figure out which ones are missing on the test? I‚Äôve never been a huge fan of math, though I‚Äôm majoring in Man Econ. I know I‚Äôll have to get through more math courses, but if they‚Äôre all like this, I honestly doubt I‚Äôll survive and graduate. And if you‚Äôre taking the same class, do you feel the same way, or is it just me?

As for the final exam, I still have no idea what to expect. The professor hasn‚Äôt been much help, so I‚Äôm just here, feeling lost and already preparing myself to fail this class, even though I‚Äôm doing fine in my other courses TT"

I don't know if the ""one free ticket"" is once per year or maybe even once ever; I did go to a football game once and I think I paid at the gate, but this time I want to buy online before it sells out if possible. I could buy a regular ticket, but they're not super cheap for me and I'd want to avoid paying that much if possible. There's a few old posts from 3+ years back talking about student tickets, but I haven't found any information recently.

They don‚Äôt fix their properties, their apartments are unliveable, and management only cares about their bottom line and taking as much money from you as possible.

I lived at a Brittian Commercial managed property and it was an absolute nightmare for the 2 years. They are the worst management company I have ever encountered and I would highly recommend you stay away. 

Apartment Issues: Plumbing issues left our apartment unliveable for 2 weeks with sitting water. We had to shower at our friend‚Äôs apartments because they refused to fix it. I called every day and they continued to ignore us and never send anyone out until I escalated and said I was going to contact the California Renters Board. Water would leak from the ceiling for weeks. 

The entire complex has mold issues and instead of fixing it and adding fans, they just paint over it. This was an issue at the entire complex and they stated it was the ‚Äúrenters responsibility‚Äù even when we followed all the mold mitigation in the lease agreement. We were never charged for mold, but they painted over mold for the next tenants.

No On Site Managers: Our property had no manager for 6+ months - so when emergencies popped up, we called the emergency line and they replied ‚Äútough luck, figure it out yourself - we can‚Äôt do anything because you have no on site manager. Our old on site manager was suing them for illegal practices (thus why she left) - which says a lot about them. 

Deposit: They attempt to take as much as your deposit as possible to make upgrades to the property. They lied to us and said we would receive our full deposit one week before we moved out, and then charged us for random miscellaneous things to make upgrades to the property at our expense. Take full walkthrough videos when moving in."

Wealthy and resourceful, they claim the mantle of visionary liberators while building empires that narrow our choices, stifle our freedoms, and consolidate power over society.

Anti-work philosophy reminds us that our labor should empower us, not fuel the ambitions of billionaires. Democratic socialism shows us that true democracy must reach the economic realm, dismantling monopolies and ensuring that wealth serves the collective good, not private empires.

It‚Äôs time we organize, resist, and reclaim our future. Together, we can dismantle this corporate feudalistic structure, creating systems rooted in justice, autonomy, and genuine freedom.

Sacramento has a very underrated Asian foodie scene!!!! 

Quan Nem Ninh Hoa¬†has the best Vietnamese spring rolls in America imo. It beats Brodard‚Äôs in Garden Grove imo.

Plenty of great Korean but YD house has the best complimentary Banchan I have seen outside of Korea-town in Los Angeles.  Kinda pricey for dinner though.

Heat Shabu is amazing shabu and the ayce on certain days is great value

AYCE Sushi scene is amazing as well. For my old timers, we remember the original Fuji sushi buffet was in Davis before it relocated to Sacramento.

Hello fellow students commuters,   
  
In the late afternoon of last Friday, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) voted to approve new gas regulations, which will result in as much as a 65 cent per gallon increase. This new fee is set to be implemented in January 2025. Needless to say, this will be particularly detrimental to those of us who are forced¬†to use our cars for transportation, particularly when merged with the recent increase in parking fees.

Tip #1  
For most of us, it may be too late to modify our winter class schedule at this time, as the majority of classes are already full. However, we are expected to receive our Pass times in late November. Therefore, my advice is to enroll in as many classes as possible on fewer days of the week to reduce the frequency of your commute. 

Tip #2  
This may seem to be a dramatic statement to some of you, but¬†gas¬†hikes usually impact not only people who commute but also businesses and services. As such, my second recommendation is to, sooner rather than later, stock up on items that you know you'll need/use frequently (whatever that might be). 

Thank me later. Peace ‚úåÔ∏è

Based on it, should I expect to make $34k, before taxes? Do I have to pay tuition out of pocket, or does being a TA for 50% get us a tuition remission (even if im an international student)?

Also how hard it is to get fellowships as an international student. The funding info is so confusing, would appreciate some clarification. I really wanted to know what I'm getting into. I hope I don't have to get a loan.

Molecular Paleontology: How Studying the Small Reveals Big Things About the Ancient Past with Professor David Gold,https://lettersandsciencemag.ucdavis.edu/science-technology/molecular-paleontology,19,0,2024-11-08 17:16:31,"Looking at a jellyfish is like looking into the ancient past. Survivors from the late Precambrian Era, these organisms lived in an environment completely alien to the wide swath of modern Earth. They thrived during a time when the waters of our planet were largely anoxic, the lack of oxygen making them inhospitable to most animals existing today.  

Though the Earth changed drastically over the next hundreds of millions of years, jellyfish persisted. 

‚ÄúOne reason that I love jellyfish is they‚Äôre living members of one of the oldest groups of animals,‚Äù said David Gold, an associate professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the College of Letters and Science. ‚ÄúIf you want to understand what those first animals looked like, what those animals were capable of, what their bodies were like, what genes they had, then looking at jellyfish can tell you a lot about those very first creatures that were out there.‚Äù 

Gold specializes in molecular paleontology, an area of study that combines geological, genetic and developmental tools to study the early evolution of animal life. A biologist by training, he‚Äôs fascinated by the development of life systems over long time scales. 

How has the Earth shaped lifeforms? And conversely, how have lifeforms shaped the Earth?"

I understand if you need to blow nose or sniffle too, but I cannot count the amount of times I have seen people cough or sneeze without a mask on campus (in lecture and out of lecture). There are no excuses for being this irresponsible and spreading your sickness around. No one wants to be sick while taking an important test or learning important material, so please be considerate and have human decency."

"If you‚Äôre a high school lurking on this page, please consider going to community college. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1gkbmo1/if_youre_a_high_school_lurking_on_this_page/,653,95,2024-11-05 17:07:11,"The UC applications are due soon. I understand you‚Äôre worried about not getting into a UC. You don‚Äôt want to go to community college because of the stigma. However, you need to understand one thing: nobody gives a f*ck about you more than yourself. I‚Äôm a PhD student, so I have a solid understanding of how the education curriculum works. 

As someone who did community college during high school, I can guarantee you that it‚Äôs better than the UC. Here are many reasons why:
1. It‚Äôs cheaper. That‚Äôs common sense. There is absolutely no reason for you to add more loans to your life. Sure, the average student loans is 30k, but do you really understand how difficult it is to pay that off? It‚Äôs over 300 a month. If you have a low paying job after graduation, 300 a month is considered a lot! With this job market, I would avoid student loans at all cost.

2. You get a better education at CC. I hate it when the UC students say things like ‚ÄúWe get Harvard professors.‚Äù Let me tell you the truth. UC undergrads barely get professors who graduated from Harvard. Are there Harvard professors? Yes, they do exist at the UC. However, top professors are mostly doing research and mentoring PhD students. It‚Äôs usually PhD students, lecturers, or adjuncts who are teaching. PhD students are generally less experienced than your community college professor. Most of them do not have enough teaching experiences. They hate teaching but are forced to because they need to have their tuition waived. They hate their job. Your CC professors actually applied to get their job whether they hate it or not. 

Lecturers and adjuncts are underpaid, so they also teach at your community college or CSU. Because it‚Äôs the UC level, whoever is your educator doesn‚Äôt care about you like how community college professors do. You‚Äôre on your own, and it can be very challenging for a young adult. In summary, you‚Äôre getting similar education, yet you‚Äôre paying so much more. 

3. The UC is for PhD. It‚Äôs a research institution. As an undergraduate, you do not need to know the same information as a PhD. 

4. No employer asks if you did community college. I finished my associate‚Äôs degree when I was a high school student. Nobody asked me for my AA degree. If you‚Äôre so ashamed of your CC degree, then you can always just mention your 4 year degree. I mean, you‚Äôre not lying since they didn‚Äôt ask if you went to CC, right?

5. You can always transfer to a UC.

6. This is the harsh truth and many people will disagree with me, but in general, UC courses are more difficult. The curriculum are similar in terms of GE courses, but please remember that the UC comprised of mostly top students. However, CC has different types of students (They also have top students as well, but that‚Äôs just one of the groups). At a UC, you‚Äôre fighting with these top students for an A. Although you‚Äôre not directly fighting with them, you are expected to be at the same level as your peers. You‚Äôre being compared with them. Your grades will definitely be lower when you‚Äôre compared with some of the smartest students. I was always a top student during CC but got humbled real quick at the UC level. 

If you want to go to med school, it‚Äôs a smarter idea to go to a CC and do well in your science courses. Medical schools don‚Äôt care about your undergrad university. They just care about what grades you got for your science courses and MCAT scores. Sure, some med schools give extra points to students to go top universities because they understand the rigor of the curriculum. However, you need to understand that a 3.9 GPA at CC is very different from 3.2 at UC. Let‚Äôs say the med school committee gives you extra points at the UC level, it would only be 3.3 or 3.4. That‚Äôs still not as high as the 3.9 at the CC. Think smart and beat the system. 

If you want to go to law school, they only care about your LSAT and GPA. 

PhDs only care about your research experiences and grades (sometimes GRE). You can gain research experiences during your master‚Äôs. 


6. The UCs offer degrees that are generally not practical. Most degrees are theory-based, and that‚Äôs best for PhD students ‚Äî not undergrads. 

7. Your intelligence is not defined by where you go to college. It‚Äôs defined by how you treat people. A true intelligent person doesn‚Äôt need to go tell others about how smart they are. They let their merits define who they are.

Election Day thoughts from canvassing thousands of doors in Davis across multiple campaigns,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1gkbmb4/election_day_thoughts_from_canvassing_thousands/,69,8,2024-11-05 17:06:48,"I work on a city council campaign, and over the past year I‚Äôve spent dozens of weekends knocking on doors. I‚Äôve also spent nearly every Saturday Morning at the Farmers Market, talking to people and answering questions about the campaign I‚Äôm working on. In addition to that, I‚Äôve worked on a campaign for District Attorney and a local ballot measure. I‚Äôve been up to Woodland collecting signatures to recall a school board member, and in my hometown to oppose the recall of the governor. 

Every campaign is different, but there‚Äôs one universal truth that stands out every single time: **the older generation votes reliably.** But when I knock on a door in a college student‚Äôs apartment or house? It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm talking to a wall. There‚Äôs no sense of responsibility to get involved or how much it matters. Voter apathy is very high in our generation.

Why don‚Äôt things ever change for young people? The answer is simple: because **we don't show up**. And because we don‚Äôt vote, our voices get drowned out by the older generations who *do* vote. **A vote in this election does more than just weigh in on the candidates and issues we care about. It sends a message to the political class that our generation‚Äôs concerns** ***are*** **worth listening to.** It's easy to assume that our vote doesn‚Äôt matter, but that‚Äôs exactly the mindset that allows things to stay the same. 

The last door I knocked in this most recent election was an eighty nine year old woman who had voted reliably in every election since the Kennedy administration. If she votes, why don't we, when it's our future on the line?"

I am thinking of taking ENG 35 winter. Originally I wanted to take it in spring alongside very little classes but what I am considering is taking ENG 35 PHY009C MAT022B

Winter :  ( possible uwp001v : Dan Melzer )

Spring:

I am prone to being sad during winter but overall I can easily burn myself out, I usually go to all the offices hours I can to get work done. This fall I realized that with 22A and 9C. Usually fall quarter doesn't have awful schedule issues due to late pass times.

I'm choosing between ENG35 or GEL050/GEL050L

I was switching majors from sociology to psychology, I could not meet with any psychology advisors until I declared my major, couldn‚Äôt declare my major/ fill out the major change form until I took intro to psychological research methods (PSC 041) which I took over the summer. I petitioned to take psych classes saying I had taken PSC 041 in order to sign up for classes on time. 

My petition was denied & my sociology adviser could not figure out why. She spent a lot of her free time sorting this situation out & for that I am grateful. FINALLY I was able to register for classes. I allegedly needed a bio class & some psychology classes & got into all 4. I was very excited, my advisor used to help me with my sociology classes & she was great. I started my classes & immediately was struggling in this biology class. Swamped from day 1. I felt so behind as soon as I got there. I‚Äôve posted about this class a couple of times here & I have not been able to find a tutor. I attended office hours & was extremely behind everyone else who attended every single time. I had to drop a psychology class I really liked in order to manage this class & I still feel like I am floundering.

I studied my hardest & failed the first midterm. I met with some advisers at the L&S department who suggested I fill out a course equivalency petition for a human bio course I had taken previously & the petition was passed after the drop deadline for this class. I finally met with a psychology advisor to discuss this situation & she was so upset, she said she‚Äôd never have recommended this class to me & that she is going to see what she can do. She eventually meets with the L&S department and tells me there‚Äôs nothing she can do, & I can do a NP and retake the class. I want to go to law school. After meeting with a law advisor here they advised me that a NP is an F according to law school admissions. He said to do everything I can in order to not receive a NP. 

I guess my question is, is there anything that can be done to mend this situation?

If I wanted to start organizing a protest to lower the cost associated with parking on campus, via monthly passes, reduced rates, or whatever other compromise we may reach, would you guys support it?

How could I start organizing this, and what makes a protest successful in creating organized change?

I am a first-year who was a high school students with all A's, which is how I got in here. Everyone says that if you were accepted you are meant to be here but I am afraid for me that is not the case. The reason for that was because I always crammed. I either skimmed through notes or memorized how to do math problems the night before exams and I was always successful. This was because high school is really easy. After taking the exam, I mean right after, I completely forgot everything. I have never learned. I never learned how to learn, and I am still cramming in college and still forget everything right after an exam unless I‚Äôm using it again. This cramming is actually working out for me, my grades are good. The problem is I am not learning anything. I am a comp sci major funny enough. This quarter I'm in precalc and prechem because I was too scared to start with the real classes and cramming is sort of actually working. But again, not learning. I took chem in high school-forgot everything- but I retaught myself and am recognizing it again. Is that normal? But I know after this class I‚Äôm going to forget it all again. I have already forgotten how to do everything on my midterms so I may he screwed for my finals,  I don‚Äôt know. I don't think this will be the case for me with programming/coding classes- I think I will actually learn in those courses. But I just can't bring myself to stop cramming and just memorizing math specifically... precalc and prechem arent major courses so I think next quarter once I start taking actual major courses I still have a chance to start learning but I just honestly don‚Äôt know how and most importantly I don‚Äôt think my brain is capable of learning because I can‚Äôt remember even when I try. It‚Äôs really because I have so many stress factors in my life and mental illness that have fogged my brain and I have big memory issues. I don't want to be degree-less. I think my best option is to drop out but I don't know how to explain to my poor parents that I can't learn. It sucks because I really think comp sci is cool- I can‚Äôt think of anything I‚Äôd like outside of stem majors and I don‚Äôt want to be broke tbh. Stupid question: How important is it to remember how to do math after college once you start a career? I mean I know we're learning for a reason but.....yeah. Thanks for reading this."

I want to organize an actual letter of grievance to whoever is in charge here. I signed a contract with them, NOT the laundry company, which, by the way, has nothing but TERRIBLE reviews. You look them up and almost every result that is not their website is someone talking about how horrid they are. 

  
This is completely wrong, and very disappointing. Housing is not at all fulfilling their end of the bargain, contracted with a company known for being atrocious in technology, customer service, and repair work, and is now trying to shove the blame onto them instead of taking responsibility for their own failure.

To the lady in the Nissan Rogue who reversed in the left turn lane pushing me and my bike several feet back and making me fall on the wet concrete,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1ghvkba/to_the_lady_in_the_nissan_rogue_who_reversed_in/,131,12,2024-11-02 12:42:48,"You know who you are. What the fuck are you doing?   
  
Here is more context of what happened. I was pulling out of my apartment on my bike to go to a club meeting at approximately 7:00 pm yesterday November 1st. This was when it started raining a bit. I needed to make a left turn while the car in question was also making a u-turn on the center left turn lane in front of me (this part isn't actually important I'm just clarifying how I knew it was a lady). After we both made our turns we ended up both waiting to turn left at the light. Then all of a sudden they reverse a whole car's length back and cross the solid white line to make a right turn? In doing so they dragged my entire bike back with them and made me fall without even noticing me. They didn't even reverse slowly, they applied the gas when they reversed so I had no time to react. I did however get up in time to take a picture of their plate, that being said there was no witnesses besides myself. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that it was dark and raining but the negligence is crazy. If you think about it more, them making the u-turn at the start means they did the wrong turn in that same intersection. üò≠

   1. Be career oriented, join tech clubs, grind leetcode and stack internships, get the f out as quickly as you can & make as much money
   2. Focus heavily on academics, do research on theoretical topics and go to grad school

I don't really talk to people outside of CS and was wondering what it's like for other majors -- are most people planning to go to grad school? Obviously for something like science I'm guessing most are on pre-med track and trying to go to med school, or if you're doing something like poli sci perhaps you're on pre-law? Then there are other majors like man-econ or comms or psychology and I'm not sure what the post-grad career plans are.

My roommate who's vegan was making sushi in the kitchen last month and kind of had a little slip with the, you know, sushi knife on the cutting board. And yeah, REALLY important. He really really likes being naked all the time. Like ALL the time. With his big nine inch horse cock always out in the open dripping precum all over everything, like our apartment ALWAYS smells like fresh cum and it's so fuckin hot. And he's got the muscles and a six pack and everything, jawline that could cut through steel. SO fuckin hot, so glad I get to see his nine incher all the time.

Well, anyways, he bumps into me (naked of course) and his sticky precum gets all over my balls as his cock grazes me. Anyways, I'm sitting there with my sticky balls and he's in the kitchen making his world-famous vegan sushi when all the sudden I hear a crunch and a crash and a scream. I run over and he's literally holding up his dick screaming.

So yeah, apparently he accidentally sliced off his penis, all nine inches of it as he was carelessly cutting up his sushi. Anyways, it's a total shitshow, as we're frantically try to figure out what the fuck to do. I'm holding his big severed penis trying to get him to calm down and getting him to do some yoga. That definitely works a bit, and then we decided the best thing to do would be to duct tape it back. That worked for about an hour until it detached and fell off again.

Anyways, he wouldn't go to the hospital cuz he thinks hospitals are fuckin communist and we ask ChatGPT what to do with his severed penis situation. It tells us to do nothing and that eventually his XL sized fuck tool will grow back to its original size, maybe even an inch or two longer. We breathe a sigh of relief and realize everything will be OK. His dick stump stops bleeding and we clean up his balls and the mess he's made and go to sleep knowing everything will come back to normal."

   I'd like to begin by saying that Ninja Turtles are not genetic mutants, they're hyper evolved. They are smarter, faster, and stronger than regular turtles. But What is a turtle? What makes them different from a tortise? I'm no expert, but it has to do with the mentality. There comes a point in unlocking your true inner warrior that the necessity for water becomes nothing more than an emotion, which can be ignored. In fast, As a young man, I've had many days wherein drinking water was totally impossible due to overpopulation of squirrels in the streets of LA. Master Splinter's were killed in a fight between the SDF (squirrel defence force) and the RRA (rat republican army). As a result of this, Master Splinter was raised without adequate water in him eastern style home. The walls of such buildings are often sorf and must be repaced within not a small number of callender cycles. It is imporatnt to note that the SDF is a volunteer force, consisting of ONLY SQUIRRELS. 

   Listen to me. I've spoken with Master Splinter and he recognizes the immorality of his training of Ninja turtles. However, becasue of the crimes against his family by the SDF, he has chosen to not drink any more water until the warring patries can lay down their arms in the fight for Peace and Solidarity. It must be noted that he will still be recieving nutrients via fecal transplant.

if not, my other options apart from enl3 were:
uwp 101y,
uwp 007 (i have heard that it is still a lot of writing),
uwp 048 (idk if this is eng composition tho)
uwp 102a,
uwp 104a (have heard it's easy but i am a bio major and don't know anything about business), and

I am a fourth year studying Civil Engineering and I promise you guys that everything does get easier. They make those intro classes so hard to get people to swap majors. As you grow as students you will form better study habits, learn tricks and techniques, and learn how to play into the system. I found thermodynamics and structural analysis easier than vector calculus and classical physics. Some fun facts about how I did in those first classes: MT2 in PHY9A I got 12/60, MT1 in MAT21C 17/35, Final exam in CHE2A 31/90. I passed all those classes with B-'s and have a job lined up for when I graduate in the low 6 figures.

UC Davis research has revealed that seagrass beds improve water chemistry, reducing local water acidity by up to 30%.

I got my chem midterm this Friday. Not sure who told me to take both chem and bio in the same quarter as a first year.

Ultimately didn‚Äôt turn out good and now im hopeless. My professor doesn‚Äôt do curves, so my only realistic option here is to try balancing both chem and bio and hope to do better next exam.

My girlfriend is hoping to study abroad at UC Davis during this upcoming summer semester, and to immerse herself deeply in American culture by getting involved with campus life, volunteering, and club activities.

Her and I are both wondering, however, about how active the campus actually is during the normal summer semester? Would she be able to get involved with campus life and engage with the community during this time, or does it get really quiet there during the summer months? 

How about the town itself - is it still lively during summer or is it quiet? Are there a lot of opportunities for social life during these months?

Would really appreciate any help, insight, advice, or thoughts on this - ASAP please!

Much love,"

I talked to them via a zoom appointment on October 3rd and the SDC informed me that they would email my professors regarding my situation.

I just wanted to let you know that as a low income student trying my absolute best to be successful so I can get my foot in the door in my industry this was a huge compliment and I am so sorry I did not have my rate sheet with me. So for feet picks of me wearing socks its just $5 for 5 photos and for bare foot photos its $10 for 2 photos. For custom work such as stepping on fruit it depends on the type of fruit and freshness of the fruit. So for example, If you want me to step on a cucumber thats just gonna be $25  per photo but for something more messy like an over ripe banana thatll get in between my toes that will run you $50 unless of course you buy in bulk then we can discuss rates based on fruit type and quantity of photos.

ALWAYS PAY ATTENTION

There are four rules to follow as a biker/scooter

1) NEVER bike with both ears covered with headphones in. I cannot stress this enough. YOUR safety is important. 

2) USE your signals when turning! To turn right, extend your right hand, and to turn left, extend your left hand. 

3) the person in the roundabout has the RIGHT of way. YOU yield to them. If you are going straight and you enter a roundabout, stay on the right/middle side so you don't collide with someone turning left.

4) Treat bikes like cars. The left lane is for passing/ fast lane except when turning. 

  
Walkers

There are four rules to follow as walkers

1) NEVER walk with both ears covered with headphones in.

2) When crossing the road and if you see a bike, DONT stop. The bikers have probably predicted your move and will 9/10 go around you. 

3) LOOK BOTH ways before crossing the street. 

4) DONT WALK ON THE ROAD. Guys sidewalks exist.

Today my counselor and I were talking about it and I realized it‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt seem to get over. The first B I ever got in college completely destroyed my academic confidence ( I even asked my professor to fail me so I could retake the course and get an A). Seeing my grades gives me so much anxiety, to the point I stop trying. ‚ÄúI never excelled academically, and took some pride in ‚Äúnot fulfilling my potential,‚Äù in part because I was terrified that if I tried my hardest, the world would learn I didn‚Äôt actually have that much potential.‚Äù -John Greene

That‚Äôs how I feel. I can‚Äôt get a B and be happy, it‚Äôs as bad as getting an F. Seeing my grades doesn‚Äôt help me. I don‚Äôt want to see my grades and I don‚Äôt know how to go about changing that. Canvas doesn‚Äôt allow you to hide your grade. Do you think it‚Äôs realistic to ask each of my professors to not submit my grades on canvas so I can‚Äôt view them? I know they all have a lot of students and they‚Äôre all busy. Is there something I can do?? Can I get an exception or something? I really wish I could just get over it, but up until now I haven‚Äôt been able to.

But I fear it has gotten to a breaking point. Let me explain because I understand this may seem like an overreaction, considering the podcast is popular at the moment. But when I say he doesnt stop watching it, I mean it. Every waking hour in my room, I hear hear the wretched sound of JoJo Siwa on last week‚Äôs video. He literally LOOPS it for hours on end while hes studying, eating, sleeping, EVERYTHING. It‚Äôs been like this for the last week or two ever since I sent him a stupid tiktok, and he discovered what it was. He even admitted he puts his phone on the ground in the communal dorm bathrooms to watch it. The worst part however, is not the video, for I can tune that out with headphones, but the references when Im just existing around the dorm or around school. Ex) I hear this stupid joke as soon as I walk in the dorm or wake up EVERYDAY, this morning included. It goes like, ‚Äúhawk 1: wheres hawk 3?, hawk 2: uhhh‚Äù and then he sits there and asks if I get it until I say yes, ITS INFURIATING. Last night he said, what if when you pray, you say hawkletuah, instead of hallelujah and I just about blew my brains out. And dont get me started on a few days back when we passed by each other around campus while I was rushing to a class, and he decided it would be best to walk with me and deliver some joke about how his grandma died for 43 minutes and somehow came back to life because of talk tuah, what does that even mean? I finally had enough of this behavior this morning when I was on a phone call with my friend from home (outside the dorm room) and he found me in the lounge, and TOOK my PHONE to play the new episode of talk tuah at full volume + ran away with it. IT RELEASED 3 HOURS AGO. I still dont have my phone back. Im hiding in the lounge. I cannot live like this. How do I approach the subject matter given the strange circumstances? If I cant get him to stop, will someone transfer, Ill take anyone else?"
