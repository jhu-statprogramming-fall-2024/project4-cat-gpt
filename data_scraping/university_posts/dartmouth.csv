DDS questionable use of funding,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/1gt2do5/dds_questionable_use_of_funding/,20,2,2024-11-17 01:26:43,"Is anyone else concerned about the way Dartmouth Dining Services is spending money? Palm scanners in foco? *Really?* Why aren't we just adding one or two more cashiers during rush hour? Aren't there better improvements that could be made, not just at foco but around campus?

Additionally, meal plans are not only expensive but also required for all students living on campus (even those with their own kitchens in senior apartments and medical/dietary restrictions, speaking from personal experience). Meal swipe equivalencies don't usually cover a full meal outside of foco, and everyone knows how DBA is in short supply at the end of the term if not well into a negative balance.

These items are indicative to me that DDS is not acting in the interest of the students. Nobody asked for palm scanners, we asked to be able to afford food through a meal plan if it has to be required. Not to mention DDS Director [Jon Plodzik's history at UNH](https://www.boston.com/news/schools/2016/04/28/university-new-hampshire-regrets-17570-dining-hall-table/). I'm concerned.

 I'm a sophomore at a liberal arts college in the US. I'm thinking of applying to transfer to Dartmouth.

The reason I want to transfer is mainly academics, connections, and my desire to go to a really good grad school afterward. A school like Dartmouth will let me explore my fullest potential.  So far I've been finding courses at school pretty easy and I'm advised by my advisors (including an alum from Dartmouth who said he wants to write me a letter of recommendation) to transfer. At school, I'm very involved and I'm pretty ambitious. My GPA is 4.0.  I love academics and so far the Econ department at my school is not cutting it. I know that Dartmouth will offer me a more rigorous undergrad education and better opportunities in and out of college. I'm interested in doing Economics research as well, and the Econ faculty at Dartmouth seems great.

Do you think transferring would be wise? How many transfer students generally get accepted? ( I know the student body there is small). Please give me any advice. Thank you so much!

Dartmouth cares alot about personality and I feel like i can showcase mine vividly through my LORs and essays. thats why i want to try for it.

Im from a third world country and i need a hefty aid so i want to carefully pick the colleges i apply to and not waste any slot on my common app.

When they wrote to the professor to get feedback on their performance (which required a few emails and involving a dean) the professor responded - you never turned in your final. The student then provided electronic evidence that they had - in fact - submitted their paper on time, both in the weird wordpress site the professor used for this assignment - and because the wordpress site seemed odd - via email directly to the professor.

The dean told the student to submit a petition with their evidence attached. They did so. And now today - the dean has written and said essentially that they will leave it to the professor to decide if grading the final paper is worth it or not. ummmmmmmmm WHAT?

The student is now waiting to hear from the professor - but this professor has been pretty unresponsive throughout the whole process. And the student is trying to manage their incredible anxiety over what seemed like a situation that has an easy and obvious resolution - grade the paper and adjust the grade to whatever the addition of the final score would be.

The dean's response - frankly is the most shocking part of this. The advocacy and impartiality seems weak at best.

Is there a path for escalation if the professor decides there is no reason to rescore the exam she missed?"

- **Internships**: Completed multiple paid internships during undergrad in diverse sectors like Finance, Healthcare, AI/ML, and Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Data Analytics.
- **Extracurriculars**: Active in AIESEC, held multiple leadership roles at both local and international levels.
- **Volunteering**: Involved in various NGO projects (animal welfare, education for school girls).
- **GRE**: Yet to take (scheduled for late October).

Would really appreciate any insights! Thanks in advance."

Meanwhile, average rent in the Upper Valley has nearly doubled over the last 5 years. Graduate and professional students, along with faculty and staff, fight each other over what few apartments are available and affordable to them. The rest are at the mercy of well-known Upper Valley slumlords like Jolin Kish -- whom Dartmouth just paid $25 million for her West Wheelock properties described in the article. This enabled her to turn around and buy a bunch of other properties in town, close long-standing businesses in the area, kick students and faculty out, then double everyone's rent.

If only there were, like, a lot of available land in the Upper Valley for Dartmouth to build on? Say, an abandoned golf course directly attached to campus and already owned by the university?"

""Meal equivalencies are now $6.25 for breakfast, $8.50 for lunch, $10.00 for dinner, and $6.25 for late night"".

How are the Marek South apartments in Lebanon? Are they worth the high rent?

The same builders are building 1 and 2 bedroom Marek North apartments, and are proposing $2700 for 1-beds and $3600 for 2-beds in about 2 years. 

I know this because I am a potential investor in the project but can’t wrap my head around such high rent estimates in their business plan. 

The rents seem to be targeted towards (1) hospital staff (2) dartmouth university staff and students (3) growing tech crowd. 

I can’t imagine as a student you would be paying even $1800 if sharing. But is this something normal in that area? Wanted to know a local opinion. 

Would you pay $2700 for 1 bed or $3600 for 2 beds for luxury apartments?

Is CS at Dartmouth worth it?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/1dvrqrl/is_cs_at_dartmouth_worth_it/,15,8,2024-07-05 06:53:40,"I have been admitted to Dartmouth, and got around 50% scholarship. Which leaves me 45k$ to pay for the college (every year, if not more).
I’m going for a bachelors in Computer Science this September.
I’m 20 and attended the best university in my country and finished the first year in CS too, but I decided to give it a break and give Dartmouth a shot, hoping I would get more aid. 

45k seem a lot, and I don’t think it is worth the education. I nearly pay 2k$ in my country and still get also good education, but it’s the network and the experience what matters to me. 

I’m unable to find much scholarships for international students. It sucks and the process is just too long, and I can’t seem to find a way to finance the education, financial aid wouldn’t give me more scholarship, and I’m not willing to take loans and spend years after graduating just repaying this type debt.

I’m very hesitant wether to finish my Bachelor’s in my current university and move on to the USA to study at Dartmouth.
Money is my only issue, had I had more scholarship, I would’ve gone. I hope that once I arrive there getting even more aid and scholarships will be easier.

Additionally, I really wanted to work outside the college, but I believe as an intl student I’m only allowed 20 hrs a week and on campus only. 
I want to eventually end up working in the US and move there.

Now my question is what to do? Is Dartmouth really worth paying this much? Is it better if I keep this for the graduate education as it’d be easier to find scholarships for it? Can I find enough scholarships before September? What should I do?

Why Does Mira Murati Only Mention Dartmouth as Her Alma Mater?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/1dn7aci/why_does_mira_murati_only_mention_dartmouth_as/,9,2,2024-06-24 06:55:56,"[https://www.linkedin.com/in/mira-murati-4b39a066/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mira-murati-4b39a066/)  
  
Hey guys. I recently discovered that Mira Murati (CTO of OpenAI), a renowned alumna of the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, actually completed a dual degree 3+2 engineering program.   
However, I noticed that on her LinkedIn and in various media profiles, she only lists Dartmouth as her undergraduate alma mater and does not mention the partner school. (which I believe is Colby)

This made me curious—why might she choose to highlight only Dartmouth? Is this similar to how notable figures like Donald Trump and Elon Musk are primarily associated with UPenn?

I assumed the 3+2 engineering program would differ since graduates receive two degrees instead of fully transferring to a new institution. Do other 3+2 program graduates commonly do this, or is this unique to her?"

We are hoping that this research study will result in a sleep treatment that will help many people who have these types of sleep problems. 



This study is really exciting because we’re offering free sleep coaching with therapists who have specialized training in sleep therapy at UC Berkeley. This is a unique opportunity to get access to no-cost sleep coaching for those struggling with their sleep. Eligible individuals will receive compensation for completing each part of the study (four 60-90 minute Zoom interviews, 7 days of wearing a sleep watch, and 7 days of completing online surveys). Additional information provided upon phone screening. The study is entirely remote.

6. i dont know how the layers of beddings work. like will a blanket and comforter be enough already? will Dartmouth provide those along with pillows? if not, where can i buy those things?
7. i heard that there are no sales taxes in New Hampshire, does this mean i only pay the price that is given? also, how does tipping work?

Fraternity question,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/1bvtkam/fraternity_question/,3,8,2024-04-04 17:45:16,"I understand that you can only pledge to one fraternity. However, I have heard from people that you could pledge to two if the fraternities are separated as social and professional/academic (I don’t know if this is even true or not, just heard it from a friend who knows more about frats than I do). Is this the case at Dartmouth? Are frats separated distinctly into two groups, one for social purposes and one for academics/career? If so, can you still only pledge to one?

Currently, I'm working as a consulting engineer at a parking solutions company in Dubai. However, I'm eager to transition into the field of Machine Learning, which is why this program caught my eye.

Before I dive into the application process, I have a few questions:

1. Does my academic and professional background meet the admission criteria for this program?
2. Are there any financial aid or scholarship opportunities available for this program?
3. Can anyone provide insight into the acceptance rate for this specific degree program?
4. Will the quality of education I receive through this online program be comparable to that of an on-campus program?

I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights from those who have experience with this program or any similar programs.

I talked about how, even when I wasn’t debating, I coached my own team and even found time to mentor new teams, and volunteer to judge at tournaments. 

Recently, my debate league awarded me a Community Award at one of our major tournaments yet. As the league manager said in his speech, I was nominated throughout the entire year by students of almost every other school, by my team, our coach, and other staff. He stated that I was by far in history one of the people who was nominated by such a large majority of the league (and I didn’t even suspect a thing!)

Dartmouth Interview Tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/1an7p09/dartmouth_interview_tips/,12,3,2024-02-10 04:17:28,"Hey y’all. I recently had an interview, I just wanted to let y’all know that obviously not everyone has the same experience, therefore, you will not know what exact questions will be asked. My interview was EXTREMELY casual, but my interviewer was also a big yapper— it also helped that she was a doctor and I’m a premed. Through her I definitely felt I learnt more about Dartmouth than the school will learn about me (she did complement me and my resume a lot so not necessarily bad). Therefore, here are MY tips
1. Don’t take it TOO seriously- don’t try too hard, definitely sell yourself but at the end of the day it’s just a conversation 
2. My interview was set up weirdly so I did not know my interviewer beforehand- if you do know who is interviewing you- find out a little bit about them *google—  a 50 yr old businessman and a 25 yr old medical student might be different conversationalists
3. Know the school and know what you want to study. WELL. Talk programs,professors, classes, clubs, etc. related to your major 
4. People love to talk about themselves. Ask AT least five questions throughout the interview 

I think my interview went pretty well, and hopefully it does for y’all too!! Let’s hope we all get in :)!!"

I was thinking of submitting one of the videos I produced for the *Breakthrough Junior Challenge*\--an international STEM competition where high schoolers create engaging videos explaining a complex scientific topic of choice. This competition is the top EC and the top award on my application. I've also dedicated a supplemental essay detailing what excites me about creating videos for this competition, and how I actually produce them.

**If I do submit something, it will be my Quantum Entanglement video which gained me international recognition in the competition (and frankly, is probably my best work):**

&#x200B;

I know that a school like Dartmouth values curiosity and originality, and I'm certain the videos I made showcase both of those traits perfectly. Though, I've also heard that if they consider my video sub-optimal, then that may hurt my application and reduce the weight of my biggest award and extracurricular.

Another tiny concern I have is that my video could appear to be too ""sciencey"" for an arts portfolio. I will put it under the electronic arts category (which contains things like film and digital media) but I don't know how they will compare an educational physics video to short films/movies that other applicants submit. Maybe the unique theme of my video will help me stand out?

After watching the video, do you think I should submit an optional arts portfolio?

Specifically:

1. Is my video good enough to submit as an arts portfolio?
2. Will it be too ""sciencey"" and out-of-place? or will that help me stand out?

&#x200B;

\*for those who know\*

3. Will my AO see any of the videos I submit through the arts portfolio, or just the faculty reviewers?

Incoming co’28 here! It’s too early for me to know what exactly I'd like to major in in college but I’m very interested in econs and govt.

 I’m not too interested in double majoring so I was wondering if it would be possible for me to modify econs w govt for my major? I couldn’t find any information about this specific combination on any Dartmouth website. I saw that the govt department offered govt modified w econs on their website, but this wouldn’t work for me as I’m an international student and would like the stem major f1 otp extension visa after college.

I know that Dartmouth offers an AB+BE Engineering Program that can be done in 4 to 5 years. 

Can I obtain an AB in Engineering Sciences modified with Computer Science and a BE in Computer Engineering in 4 years? 

I think this is the most beautiful aspect of Dartmouth's Engineering Program because you go through a liberal arts/more broad curriculum compared to other schools.

Also, if I want to go to Dartmouth's graduate school for an extra year to obtain a Master's, will that be hard?  How is the financial aid? Do I have to apply for the graduate program or do I matriculate another year? How hard is it to get in? Is it worth it?

How is the overall job outlook and salary?

Edit: 
It seems that people are getting the idea that I am either (A) a high schooler considering Dartmouth and/or (B) applying at a college and looking for inspiration on admission essays. 

I am extremely discouraged by the responses since I completed college years ago. I’m not sure if the poor responses are because of my lack of context in the original post, the nature of this subreddit, herd mentality, etc.

The reason I made this post is because my wife is considering taking a job that would move us across the country to work with Dartmouth students.

Of course, as some of you suggested, our first reactions were to look up Dartmouth and see what students study there, what’s unique about Dartmouth, etc.

As you can imagine, most of the results were extremely generic (from college comparison websites) or extremely biased (from Dartmouth’s websites).

I really just wanted some real-world perspective on why individuals like or don’t like Dartmouth and for what reasons - whether that be general or personal. 

I would still love to hear from any of you regarding this.

Thank you."

I do not know whether that decision is leaning towards the more positive or negative side, however, I really want to do something about it. The thing is that I have no clue what. Of course, I have already tried searching up on the Internet the whole deferral thingy etc... but the following are things I really do not understand. This is what Darty says:  

  
""As we reconsider your application in the months ahead, we welcome any supplemental material you would like to add to your application via your portal. Please ask your counselor to forward your Mid-Year Report to us as soon as it is available .""

  
I cannot see any ""update"", ""supplemental material"" button in my Darty app portal. Am I supposed to send it by mail? If so, to the whole admissions office... or just to my ""regional"" admissions officer?   
Also, when is it appropriate to send it? Should I wait a bit until the start/middle of January or something, so I can actually finish up one of my academic and service projects?  
What is it appropriate for me to send? LOCI only? Or some art/research portfolio too through mail attachements?   
In my LOCI, should I write about why I am the perfect fit, how I could improve Darty's community and also what I have accomplished since sending my application? Or does it seem like any of the previous ideas I want to include in the letter is inappropriate or missing?

I also know that my counselor should write to the AO some sort of update, except sending the Mid-Year Report. When is he supposed to do that and should he do it through email? Should he do it along w my mid-year grades... or separately? Also, is he supposed to send the mid-year report through the mail? Or Common App?   


If I get some additional LOR... can my recommender also forward it to the AO's mail?

WES Evaluation,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/18hhbxn/wes_evaluation/,4,8,2023-12-13 13:56:29,"Hey guys!

I'm applying for Dartmouth's MEM program. However, I have some concerns regarding my academic transcripts. I have done my undergrad from India and the GPA was received on a 10-point scale. I know that most American universities require a 4.0 scale GPA.

&#x200B;

According to the university website:  


> **Applicants with international transcripts** are encouraged to submit a transcript evaluation from WES (World Education Services) along with their Dartmouth Engineering application. While a WES evaluation is not mandatory for admission, it can help expedite the application review process. If you are admitted, you will need to submit official academic transcripts for all your international coursework and credentials. WES evaluations can be used instead of official transcripts, but they must be sent directly to Dartmouth Engineering by the evaluation service provider, and they must include a copy of the official transcripts that were evaluated. 

 I contacted the admissions and they told me that they don't require WES evaluation for admission. Still, I'm kinda skeptical about the information presented on the website. Also, WES evaluation is always a pain in the ass in terms of time, effort, and money. Has anyone gone through the same? I'm kinda of getting paranoid these days thinking about perfecting my application. I would appreciate any advice. Thank you.

Harvard - dated a computer science major from here, he came to my state for an internship at some FAANG company. He was very passable aggressive, and condescending but tried to play it off like he was giving me “advice”. He always wanted to talk about his code but tbh I never gave a shit. Wasn’t a virgin (I was shocked) but was kinda awkward and kept saying he was good in bed. Terrible kisser,  but payed for every meal at dates. Would I date him again? No and I have him blocked 

Cornell - Econ major, really handsome but clearly was a playboy who was not looking for anything serious. Really good at playing the victim, kinda narcissistic but I thought I could fix him. Every hang out involved a bed and he never wanted to go to a restaurant. Was too “busy” to send good morning messages when it was legit the bare minimum. Had a girl best friend who commented on all his posts, had WAAAY too many insta followers and posted way too many selfies. 

UPenn - my favorite 😍😍 10/10 would date this guy again If I could but distance issue. He was hilarious and super creative. Would be the type of guy to say “hey wanna hear something cool?” Instead of texting me “wyd” he had amazing art and literary skills and we would talk for hours about our favorite authors (we had a lot in common) he was sooooo sweet and throughout with his words and honestly biggest green flag of a guy I’ll ever meet (I’m still not over him)

Columbia U - fuck him. He’s a little rat ass bitch who just wanted to hookup and got annoyed when I wouldn’t let him hit. 

Princeton - BIGGEST FUCKING NARCISSIST IVE EVER MET. I’m not even kidding. He gaslighted me so much and would always find a way to blame me for HIS insecurities. (He had money tho 🤑) would offer me to come to his apartment and stay over if I needed, he was always so considerate whenever I’d be sad but idk he gaslit me so much so I feel like it was an emotional tactic 

Yale - okay I really liked him but he was way too busy. Pre med and never had time to hang out so didn’t work out 

Brown university - he was goofy, had a TikTok personality and we got  along really well. I thought he was gay at first tho cause he knew too much about women. He knew what an “everything” shower was. We’re still friends 

I have not dated someone from Dartmouth yet but working on it

>Although “Animal House” was a professedly anarchic comedy that identified with the freaks, the misfits and anyone wanting to fight for their right to party, the movie ironically helped crystallize a new strain of cultural and political conservatism that started on campuses and ran all the way up to the National Mall and Wall Street.  
>  
>In other words, “Animal House” is where the 1960s finally and decisively turned into the 1980s — the 1970s being understood as a transition period highlighted by double-knit and “Kung Fu Fighting.” With “Animal House,” we crossed the line from hippies to yuppies, from “all you need is love” to “greed is good.” It seems crazy to say it, but the film’s Deltas — a fraternity of proud, self-defined losers — became role models for a generation obsessed with winning. You could argue we’re still living with the fallout.  
>  
>How do I know all this? I was there at ground zero: a preview screening of “Animal House” at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., in July 1978. There, before my eyes, an audience of listless summer-session Ivy League students was jolted into trading the bromides of their older siblings’ counterculture for what seemed like a new freedom: to say what you wanted, offend whomever you wanted, grab the rewards you felt were yours.  
>  
>One of the screenwriters of “Animal House” accompanied the film to Hanover: National Lampoon writer Chris Miller, a Dartmouth alumnus who had based Delta House on his own fraternity, Alpha Delta, which had a notorious reputation...  
>  
> I’m not saying that “Animal House” led directly to the election of Ronald Reagan two years later. But I am saying the movie empowered a generation of 20-somethings to aspire to a new hedonism — call it, at best, enlightened selfishness — that spilled over into the political sphere.

I took AP Physics C Mech/E+M in senior year and did well on both tests, so I would probably slip into PHYS 13/14 well; I also heard that bypassing them and going into the accelerated 15/16 track is good for tentative physics majors, provided I take the PHYS 15 Placement Test. Does the placement exam essentially just cover AP Physics C topics or is there other stuff I should study more?

Terrible experience with Greyhound,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/14cw2lq/terrible_experience_with_greyhound/,8,4,2023-06-18 21:43:09,"Hi folks, I'm looking for some help. My sister came to visit and booked a Greyhound ticket for Sunday 4pm. As indicated by [this map](https://www.greyhound.com/en-us/bus-station-20097) on Greyhound's website, we waited in front of the Hanover Inn, at the intersection of Wheelock and Main Street. We got there 15 minutes before departure and weren't sure this was the right place, so we called customer service, who wouldn't really say anything except repeat the address. The address is apparently 3 North Main Street, which...doesn't seem to exist? (more fun stuff: the link to the location from the email booking confirmation leads to the  Tuk Tuk restaurant!) 

So long story short, we saw a Greyhound bus drive south from North Main Street (along the Green) and turn right on Wheelock, towards Vermont. That was our bus! But it never stopped in front the Hanover Inn. We called customer service and asked where the bus stop was and we were told -- I quote -- ""I don't want to give you false information"". They literally won't tell us where to wait for the bus!

I searched the subreddit for Greyhound and found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/126ixbh/anyone_knows_where_the_hanover_greyhound_bus_stop/) -- apparently the stop is in front of the Rauner Library?! What the fuck? We are seriously pissed. Has anyone experienced this with Greyhound? (and can anyone confirm that the bus indeed picks up in front of the Rauner library? My sister is headed to Montreal, if that changes anything)

EDIT: just to update folks, Greyhound is STILL refusing to admit that the bus stop is not where they said it was. I honestly feel like I'm being gaslighted lmao. They insist that there is a glass bus shelter in front of the Hanover Inn/Hopkins Center. It hasn't been there for *month* due to the construction. This is just mind-boggling. They're also telling me that they received confirmation that other passengers were able to board at the designated pick-up spot. At this point, it truly feels like they're just lying to cover their asses. We asked people at the Hanover Inn, who said that Greyhound doesn't use the stop in front of the hotel anymore and hasn't for some time due to the construction. We contacted Dartmouth transportation services and they also said the Greyhound bus stop has been moved. To top it all off, today's bus is full, so I'll have to drive my sister 200 miles to get her home and she lost an entire day of work today. Just an absolute mess due to an obvious error that they won't admit."

Hello, I'm from India, I am expecting a positive decision from Dartmouth as a transfer applicant(will be entering 2nd year). I also have a confirmed seat at UCL London in BASc program(3yr program will be entering as 1st year)

Will there be a significant difference in feasibility of availing oppurtunities between areas such as New Hamsphire in US vs London in UK. Is that difference between rural and urban areas significant ?

If you had to choose between an ivy league such as Dartmouth vs UCL what would you choose excluding the tuition fee as a considerate factor?

In U.S a lot of colleges / unis are more liberal arts based while it is not necessarily so in the U.K. Its common for ppl in U.S to change their major atleast once before graduation? In U.K one does need certain amount of clarity as to what they want to pursue. Do you feel like liberal art institutions at U.S offer more breadth allowing students to explore when compared to U.K which might give them an edge in terms of whether any subsequent career choices are more likely to be globally optimal or meaningful. This is because you would have a broader knowledge of the landscape the world has to offer.

OR

Do you think London would provide a better horizon to seek more opportunities when compared to New Hamsphire?

Though D-plan is flexible does the short terms due to quarter systems often leave students burnt out that they can't really make use of off terms ?

For the distribution requirements, do you feel like they were helpful or do you feel like you did'nt really see a point in completing a course which doesn't really fit your major?  


Dartmouth has various centres/sppaces such as Center for career service, for sustainability, for entrepreneurship, for theatre and art as such  do they work on huge scale   


How is study vs extracurricular culture. Like is everybody very very invested in EC's. Is it really too hard to get into clubs ?

Help me you all, the fact that Dartmouth's decisions are so delayed isn't helping me either"

Biking,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/12dieyg/biking/,9,9,2023-04-06 12:15:17,"Hi, 

I am accepted to the Ph.D. program at Dartmouth. Based on some basic calculations it looks like Hanover is not the best option for housing. 

I was thinking of nearby places like Lebanon, West Lebanon, etc. Can we bike year-long from there to Dartmouth College? The current stipend does not seem to be very supportive of getting a car.

I come from a place where it never snows, I am interested in knowing how things work out in this scenario when it's snowing. Is biking to college feasible? Google Maps shows Lebanon is 4.4 miles away from the college.

Any help would be appreciated.

As a highly motivated and academically ambitious student, I am excited to apply to Dartmouth College for the opportunity to challenge myself academically and to grow as a person. I am drawn to Dartmouth's rigorous liberal arts curriculum and the opportunity to study a diverse range of subjects. I believe that this type of educational experience will not only broaden my perspective, but also provide me with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in my future career.

In addition to its academic reputation, I am also drawn to Dartmouth's commitment to experiential learning. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to participate in Dartmouth's many research and study abroad programs, which will allow me to apply the knowledge and skills I have gained in the classroom to real-world situations and to gain a deeper understanding of different cultures and ways of life.

Outside of the classroom, I am also attracted to Dartmouth's vibrant and close-knit community. I believe that being a part of a small, tight-knit community will allow me to form close relationships with my peers and professors and to fully immerse myself in the Dartmouth experience. I am also excited to participate in Dartmouth's many extracurricular activities and to take advantage of the many outdoor recreational opportunities available in the beautiful Upper Valley.

I know that some people argue that it might just be a coincidence and there isnt enough data on people who did receive the email and still got rejected, it doesnt make sense bcz I believe every and every single student out there count and take everything they receive from any admissions office via email or otherwise SERIOUSLY. the first thing I did when I received the generic email( although I had submitted all the necessary documents prior and they were ticked too), I jumped on google and typed in what I had received. I think everyone who received the email would have shared their outcomes both positive and negative. and we can see from all the past and present threads that the overwhelming majority have cited the strong correlation. 

please everyone share your thoughts on this!!

I am hoping for the best for every single one of you!! may we all earn what we deserve"

How did my interview go?,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/ywf5h8/how_did_my_interview_go/,10,2,2022-11-16 01:00:08,"So, I applied ED to Dartmouth, and I just completed my interview. I spent a few hours prepping ahead, but the interview did not go as I expected. My fat fingers ended up incorrectly typing my phone number for the interview. But, I was able to send the correct number 5 minutes before it started, and I received the call on time (I hope my interviewer didn't see it as a big flop lol...). Anyways, my interviewer was around 80 years old, but was very enjoyable to talk to. However, the interview was much more about my interviewer attempting to appeal to my interests and telling me about Dartmouth, rather than asking me questions and getting a broader understanding of who I am. He seemed very fixated on one particular activity I did, but discussed the sport's history as opposed to the sport in my context. I would say he talked for 75% of the time, and the conversation was all about this one activity. He did end up following up directly after the interview to talk more about the history of this sport. I am happy that I was able to be interviewed by someone very passionate about this sport, but I felt as though I did not get to show anything additional that would help my application. Anyone else have a similar experience?"

Things going for me are a 3.8, current internship, 6 years of work experience at the same place, pilot's license, trilingual, and probably a few other things I can play up.

My plan is to get on a grind and do some case competitions for finance (area of interest), join a few clubs, do volunteer work in my town, and to get another internship.

Now no matter what, doing these things would obviously help me get into a better school, but for Dartmouth specifically, is this a sound plan or are there more important things I should focus on?"
