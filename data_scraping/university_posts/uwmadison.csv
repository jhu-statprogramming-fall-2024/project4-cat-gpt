tips for those experiencing their first wisconsin winter!,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1gwkezb/tips_for_those_experiencing_their_first_wisconsin/,36,8,2024-11-21 17:11:18,"given the unexpected snow, im compiling a masterlist of tips and advice for international students and students from warmer climates who may not have experienced weather like this. if anyone else has any more tips or tricks, please comment them below!!

source: im a madison native

TO BUY:
- a pair of waterproof boots or lined shoes, ESPECIALLY WITH GOOD GRIPS
- a winter jacket, if you don't have one already. seriously. once it gets colder, the cold+wind combination is no-joke.
- a pair of gloves/mittens for the walk. they don't have to be big or thick, but your hands will get very cold very easily, even if they're in your pockets.

GENERAL TIPS:
- keep an extra pair of socks (or two) in your bag with you. early winter makes a lot of slush and a lot of Wet, and you Will soak through your shoes and socks probably daily.
- allow extra time for your commute to classes. it gets slippery which is not very good for a campus built on a hill, hence the buying shoes with good grips.
- always expect buses to run late. if you're choosing between two buses, your best bet is to take the earlier one.
- if you ride your bike and/or a moped, BRAKE EARLY. also check tires and brakes regularly!!! the roads in early winter (and right after a midday snow) are awful. you are likely to skid.
- consider purchasing a hat or earmuffs or something. sometimes a hood isn't enough. i didn't put this in the ""to buy"" section because they're not *imperative*, but they are helpful."

UW-Madison: L&S (Letter's and Science) major's are NOT forced to graduate.,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1gw5x1c/uwmadison_ls_letters_and_science_majors_are_not/,13,15,2024-11-21 02:44:25,"If you have googled around, you might have seen people say in the past that UW-Madison can force students to graduate as soon as they complete their major requirements. I came across some Reddit posts about this, but they didn’t make it clear who this actually applies to (at least from what I could tell).

After talking to an advisor recently, I found out that this DOES NOT apply to L&S majors at all. If you’re in L&S, the university or your advisor won’t force you to graduate just because you’ve finished your requirements. They will send you email's encouraging you to graduate, but these are not there to force you, just to remind you.

From what I’ve heard, this policy mostly applies to Engineering majors, but it might also affect students in other schools at UW-Madison.

I’m posting this to hopefully ease some stress for those worried about being forced to graduate before they’re ready. If you know whether this does or doesn’t apply to other schools here, drop it in the comments so we can build a list for everyone!

Edit: I forgot to mention that the rules seem to be entirely different if you are an international student. If you are, it's probably best to ask an advisor on what the rules are."

Also, if I do take 320, would it be difficult to take 400 and 252 at the same time along with 1 or 2 gen eds?

1: Can any transfer students give me some info on the transfer process? Was it an easy transition for you? Is it easy/hard to get accepted? 

2: How is the social scene here? I’m sure this question gets asked a lot and ik it’s a pretty nice and highly rated college town, but I am coming from a school with little to no social scene so this is a huge one for me. 

3: Are there transfer dorms available or how does housing work? I would preferably like to live in a dorm to meet people as I won’t know anyone, but I will be a junior so I’m assuming most upperclassman live off campus? 

4: How does the pre business or business school work here? I am a marketing major at my current university, and would like to transfer that over to Madison, but I saw that you need to first be accepted as pre business? Again not sure how that all works so any info on that would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you all so much for any info!"

Anyone have any insights on the two majors? Should I consider double majoring or try to choose just one? Are the requirements similar enough that they share a lot of required classes? Ive heard Conservation Biology is pretty flexible as far as Bio majors go, and I'm just trying to figure things out right now. 

My eventual goal is to work at one of the big aquariums or zoos on the east coast and help with the animals/fish there. Which one (or both?) Would get me closer to/more suited for that goal?

* CS 300  
* Math 222 (planning to take the Calc credit by exam for this)  
* Nutri Sci 132 (to fulfill the Bio Science requirement)  

I need to pick a few more courses and was wondering:  

1. Should I take CS 252  or CS 240?  

2. Should I add STAT 240?  

3. How is the workload for these classes? Is it manageable with the other courses I’m taking?  

4. If I skip Math 222 via the credit exam, what other courses can I take? Other breadth course recommendations?

I’d really appreciate any input from people who’ve taken these classes or know how they balance out with the rest of the schedule. Thanks in advance!

Any Advice for Introverted Girls Trying to Find a Date?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1gok2q4/any_advice_for_introverted_girls_trying_to_find_a/,101,55,2024-11-11 04:37:55,"
I've been trying to find a boyfriend for a while now, but I’m a bit of an introvert and, to be honest, I sometimes struggle with social situations to the point where it feels borderline misanthropic. I don’t enjoy crowded places or activities that require lots of social interaction, and I think this has made dating more difficult for me.

I’ve pushed myself to try some of the common advice for meeting people, but so far, nothing has worked out. I don’t enjoy sports, I don’t drink, and I don’t smoke, so bars, parties, and other typical social settings are pretty much off the table. I’ve tried making small talk in class, but it always feels awkward. English is my second language, and I think that adds to my nervousness and makes conversations even more challenging. One of the experiences I’ve had was during a biology lab group project. It was just me, a dude, and another girl. They hit it off right away and started dating by our third discussion. I felt completely ignored unless I was talking about the assignment. It sucked.

I’ve also joined game clubs, thinking they might attract people with similar interests, maybe shy, nerdy types like me. Unfortunately, it didn’t go any better. I remember going to a game night hosted by WUD where people were playing horror games on the Switch. I was ready to find someone to team up with, but I ended up playing alone for two hours. Nobody approached me or sat with me, and it felt pretty rough looking back on it.

I’ve tried joining group games on game nights and making the first move by asking if I could join others. The guys would let me play, but they never started conversations with me, and eye contact was rare. It felt like they were more comfortable joking around with their male friends, and I struggled to break into the group dynamic.

Dating apps are also not working very well for me. My friend (who is just as introverted as I am) even tried to hitting on boys on street. She did that by writing “Can I have your Instagram?” on a piece of paper and handed it to any guy she thought was cute. She did get some Instagrams that way, but she told me it was nearly impossible to keep a conversation going or get them to hang out.

I still want a boyfriend. I kinda just want to have someone to snuggle with after a long day. But sometimes I question if it's worth the effort, especially when it feels like I’m pushing myself to my limit just to be in social situations without panicking. 

So, is there any advice out there for someone like me? Should I keep pushing myself out of my comfort zone, or is it better to just be myself and hope someone comes along? Maybe I should accept that it’s okay to enjoy playing Switch games solo on my couch after a long day instead of chasing the idea of having a boyfriend to hug."

I'm looking for someone interested in subletting my private room in a house this upcoming spring and/or summer semester! I live in bedroom #2 on the blueprint, which is very spacious. 

  
I live with 4 great and friendly roommates (Senior girls), and share a bathroom with 2 of them. They regularly plan movie/reality TV watch nights, trips out (apple orchard, movies, concerts), birthday parties, and are really great friends!

  
Our house is in a great location on W Wilson St, about a 20-minute walk from campus, a 10-minute walk to the Capitol building (great for farmer's markets and State St), and less than a 5-minute walk from beautiful public lakeside trails. It is also near the C/38 bus routes that take you directly to campus if you don't want to walk! There is also parking behind the house if you have a car. 

  
My usual rent is $700/month, but I am more than happy to cover $100 each month for the remainder of the lease, making rent $600 + utilities. 

Note: I will be completely moving out after this fall semester including my own furniture and personal belongings, so you will be able to move into your own space for the duration of the lease! Since we are all seniors, we will not be renewing the lease for the 25/26 term.

I'm a senior who's applied EA to the molecular and cell biology major! But recently I've been thinking about how I might have overlooked the genetics and genomics major. I've heard that CALS is a lot better for research, focuses more on science and math classes, is easier to get on the dean's list, and offers more scholarships while L&S does not. Currently I've been interested in bioremediation, gene-environment interactions and translational research, and hope to do research in those fields in the future. But im pretty sure I'll find more interests once I actually go to college lol. So to all the molecular & cell biology and genetics & genomics majors, how has your experience been? Do you think molecular and cell bio is better in terms of broader job prospects and more flexible in terms of exploring different fields in biology? And if I did do molecular and cell biology, would I still be able to get research opportunities in genomics related fields?

Since these majors are offered by different schools (CALS and L&S), would I have to request for a change in major? Or would it be okay to do that once I decide to attend UW Madison? And does requesting for a change in major once I attend UW Madison cause me to lose out on any opportunities or ability to attend any events or info sessions that only CALS or L&S majors can attend? I'm still not sure about changing my major so I wanted to know what the process would be like.

My roommate has a mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Blue Keys (the loudest ones that Cherry makes) and my other roomate and I have been dreading spending any time in the dorm while the other roomate is using his keyboard. So much so, we have resorted to only studying at libraries and the lounge in our resident hall. For our sake, this sort of sucks since we both have dual monitor setups in our room that we'd rather be using. Unfortunately, we've also had no luck with noise canceling headphones. 

What made it worse at the beginning was that our roomate would type on the mechanical keyboard until almost 2 am; however, we convinced him to stop this practice during quiet hours. Nevertheless, from early morning to late evening, with the exception of his classes, you can expect to hear the keyboard when being in the room.   
  
Would it be too much to ask for him to only use it while no one else is present in the room? For context, just inches anyway, he could use his laptop keyboard. My roomate and I understand that the keyboard is his property and his right to use so we've refrained from asking him to stop using it completly; however, it has kind of gotten unbearable at points (especially since he is not a great typer and is always slamming the backspace button😭). 

Any advice from someone that has the same issue?

It’s so emotionally draining. I don’t understand how talking and spending time with someone you like personality and appearance-wise is different from being in a relationship? It’s not like I’m asking them to marry me, I just want basic commitment. It’s like they’re fine with talking, hanging out, etc. and then all of the sudden they don’t want that because it could be considered a relationship. I should probably just stop trying, but I can’t help but want a relationship, so I’m wondering if there are any decent guys out there (I swear I usually go for “nice guys”, but they seem to be terrified of commitment as well)."

Engineering and other proffeisonal stem subjects are a similar story.

The reason for the post is that, after meeting a referral from the Yale Grauduate School, he said UW and Yale were peers, which surprised me until I actually looked at the rankings. Where UW flops, is business and legal education. Unfortunately, those are two of the most popular and economically important majors you can choose, and UW being mediocre at them really brings down its prestige. I've spent 3 years here, and I always thought UW's closest peer was Michigan State, at least that's what my high school thought. "

Dog meat 😬,https://i.redd.it/dq9o6si3okxd1.jpeg,0,4,2024-10-28 22:19:50,"Had lots of thought-provoking conversations at this table about the ethics of eating animals. We protect dogs fiercely but overlook the blatant exploitation of cows, chickens, and others. 

College is the ideal place to challenge these beliefs and societal norms. Many of us were raised to see some animals as companions and others as food, despite all of them feeling pain and suffering. I was like that too and indeed loved eating animal products growing up.

A friend once told me, “You can't love animals and eat them too.” It was uncomfortable but made me reflect on whether my choices aligned with my values. 

Thanks for everyone who stopped by! "

The Wiscard websites states:

“If you find your lost card, you will need to reactivate the card in person for Wiscard account usage at the Wiscard Office in Union South.”

I never bothered doing this but I still have the old now deactivated Wiscard with me.
 
I can’t find out if there is a fee for this or not. The reason I want to reactivate my old Wiscard is because I lost my newer Wiscard and I want to know if it’s possible to avoid having to pay again to get a even newer Wiscard.

Hello from Class of 2022 Graduate (Law School) - From Madison to the East Coast: Missing the Warmth I Took for Granted,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1gcqz5w/hello_from_class_of_2022_graduate_law_school_from/,84,5,2024-10-26 18:02:05,"Hey, fellow Madison folks. I’m a 2022 law grad now working on the East Coast as a lawyer, and honestly, I’m here because I just miss everything about Madison. Funny enough, I used to complain constantly when I was a student. I’m from San Francisco, came here for a generous scholarship, and always found myself grumbling about the brutal winters and how the campus looked. But now, being in a new place where I barely know anyone, I can't emphasize more how I really miss all the friends and memories I made there.

It’s only been two years since I started practicing, so I’m still very much a junior attorney. You still get chewed out by the boss, get blunt feedback from seniors who seem like they don’t care, and are often around people who don’t value your time. It’s tough, but I love my work and feel grateful to be in this career. 

So, to those of you who might’ve also come from out of state to Madison, I get it - sometimes it’s easy to overlook what’s special about it. Trust me, there’s a warmth, a sense of community, and a real feeling of support there that I didn’t fully appreciate until now. Out here, in cities like NY, you see why many people choose to stay in Wisconsin and why the East Coast can feel so different.

So, to my fellow alumni and soon-to-be grads, I miss you all. You all made me feel human. Take care of the people around you and appreciate that warmth while you have it. In the real world, that kind of support isn’t automatic - you have to earn it. Don’t forget to love Madison while you’re there. You’ll miss it when you’re gone. "

"I Experienced Racial Discrimination at UW-Madison, and the School Is Doing Nothing",https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1gbizwt/i_experienced_racial_discrimination_at_uwmadison/,590,310,2024-10-25 01:36:49,"Hello everyone,

I'm a Asian international student at UW–Madison, and I want to share an incident that has left me extremely frustrated and stressed.

On October 22nd at around 6:10 PM, I was waiting for a friend on state street when two men approached me. They started making monkey noises at me and took videos, even holding the camera close to my face without my consent. This went on for about fifteen seconds. At first, I didn't understand what was happening .. I just stared at them. By the time I realized that this was racial discrimination, they had already walked away.

Fortunately, two bystanders witnessed the whole incident. They caught up to them and took clear photos of their faces, and they are willing to be witnesses. Using these photos, I asked around and managed to identify one of them—he is an undergraduate student here.

I called UWPD to report the incident, but they only said they would investigate it. I also reached out to the Office of Student Assistance and Support. However, they told me that all they could do was invite the student to a VOLUNTARY conversation.

I can't even believe this is real. It's like something I'd never dream of happening .. like being robbed in the library. I feel extremely helpless. There are witnesses, there are photos, I even identified one of the individuals, everything seems to be perfectly aligned to take action, yet the university is nott taking this seriously.

Is this what it means to be an Asian student here? To stand on the street and be subjected to ridicule, to be treated like a monkey, to have a camera shoved in my face without my consent, and for the school to think they don't need to do anything???

I'm sharing this here because I don't know what else to do.. Has anyone else experienced something similar? What steps can I take to ensure the university addresses this issue?

Roommate troubles,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1gbv1wo/roommate_troubles/,31,34,2024-10-25 14:05:16,"I live in a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 other boys. One of them is my friend from home and the other guys is the biggest nut job I’d ever met. Until this incident we still always had to fight with him, for example, the other day he rejected the idea of having to take equal responsibility and clean spaces in regular intervals. Because he said he’d rather clean up after each use. But he doesn’t. It’s nasty disgusting, but apparently he is clean according to him and meeting his standards should be good enough for everybody.


On to the incident. I had a proctored test online yesterday morning. I let both of them know before hand that id be giving a test and to be mindful of that. He immediately came home and as I got started I said please keep it down, I’m gonna be writing a test. He immediately comes into the kicten and starts playing annoying music loud enough so I can hear it. I’m the middle of my test I was literally begging him to turn it down but he said “he’s not responsible for it and I should’ve been more responsible “ and when I lost patience and shouted shut the fuck up he went on and on yelling mean shit which was frankly very scary bcuz it didn’t make sense why I was getting screamed at and honestly I hadn’t slept in a few days and I had the anxiety all of this broke me down, again, during the exam. Now I wasn’t able to perform as well and he completely ruined it. He went on for 30 minutes, the test duartion was 80 minutes. After the test I completely broke down and started arguing with him about why he did that. He still kept shouting that’s not my responsibility. I yelled it’s not just your house you don’t pay the whole rent we live here too, would he be okay had I done the same, am I entitled to be as loud as possible when he’s trying to study or sleep ? He then yelled you didn’t tell me it’s a proctored test. A test is a test, irrespective of this be. You be respectful of it and you don’t make unnecessarily loud noises it’s common fucking sense. Gosh he then does the screaming but by then Im in the middle of a mental breakdown and he was screaming. 
After all this I still apologised for yelling back but he said that he’s completely justified in this and that I should have to be more responsible about my exams. What does that mean ?? Where else would I give the fucking test ? In the middle of the street ? 


I’ve lost my mental peace and now he’s ruining my career. All this and this lil piece of shit still believes he’s entitled to do whatever in the house whenever he wants to. This is the most frustrating part. An apology and I would’ve completely let this go but the blindness and the entitlement about not this this but literally every single issue is seriously tolling. 


I just don’t know how to deal with this. I want to take action but I have no idea what I can do.  Oh btw he’s also super creepy he hovers outside the bathroom whenever I’m in there, he’d admitted to entering my room when I wasn’t home. 
Please advice me on what I can do, if not give me some good ideas on how I can be the same asshole he is to me, return the favour. "

On top of that, she’s incredibly messy. I’m not a neat freak, but I keep my side clean and tidy. I make my bed and regularly take out the trash, while her side is a disaster. She brought her own fridge, which is overflowing with trash and leftovers, and it smells terrible when she opens it. Her luggage is everywhere, and she hasn’t fully unpacked after nearly two months. 

I've tried to be understanding, recognizing that mental health can affect living situations. I've spoken with my house fellow multiple times, who has also attempted to talk to her about a roommate agreement, but she continues to ignore us.

Moped/Scooter/Motorcycle PSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1g83393/mopedscootermotorcycle_psa/,96,9,2024-10-20 16:47:39,"First, let’s be clear about the vehicle I’m talking about. I’m talking about a motorized, gasoline powered, step-through motorcycle. Some may call it a moped, some may call it a scooter. They can range from 49cc way up to 300cc but I imagine most of y’all are driving 49cc - 150cc around here.

So, before I moved here for grad school, I used to drive a 150cc around my old town. I put thousands of miles on it, I have an m-class drivers license and I consider myself pretty proficient. 
One time, I was driving at night (around 45mph) when I hit a puddle of water and my back wheel hydroplaned. The scooter went down. I hit the ground and rolled while the scooter skidded on the ground for like 30ft. Luckily it was around 11pm and the cars that were behind me had time to stop so I didn’t get completely creamed. I got road rash on my arms and legs, my fingers got bent up a little and i hit my knee quite hard on the ground. Otherwise I was okay.

Want to know why I was able to get up? I had a fucking full-face helmet on. As for other gear I had hefty tennis shoes on, light pants, light jacket, and heavy duty leather gloves on. I want you all to know that this is the BARE MINIMUM gear you should be wearing every time you ride. When I see people with no helmet, shorts, sandals, and no gloves on. Genuinely fear for your life. If I didn’t have gloves on every finger could be broken. If I would’ve rolled on the ground at 40+ mph with no helmet I could be dead or my face could have the skin completely ripped off, nose broken, teeth and jaws broken, skull/spine damage, you name it.


Even if your particular scooter/moped only goes 30 mph I am begging you, for the love of god, get a full face helmet, get some leather gloves, wear a heavy duty (preferably a motorcycle) jacket, wear pants, wear close-toed shoes. All gear all the time. A helmet is a 100-200 dollar purchase that will save your fucking life.

Ideas for a fun party:
-No peer pressure to drink, the party should not be about drinking, it’s simply something in the background. We can all bring our own drinks, split the cost, or each bring supplies for a alc and mixer so we all contribute and have a variety of drinks. (Like I could bring a bottle of my grandmas homemade blackberry wine, and we all have a little bit to sample) Also soda should be provided as an alternative to alcohol. 

-everyone that is coming buys a snack to bring and share (like someone could bring a bag of chips, someone could bake their own cookies and bring them, someone could bring soda etc.)

-it would be a SMALL private party. Only 15 people max, NO MORE 

-jazz music, quiet and calm (or world of Warcraft music)

-would start earlier; 5-6 pm, and we all get pizza and split the cost. 

-video games (we could have someone play a video game run through on a computer and projected and we all watch a playthrough/ and take turns controlling the game: for example
	◦	little nightmares
	◦	Duck game 
	◦	visage
	◦	last of us
	◦	LOZ
	◦	undertale
	◦	the Witcher 3
	◦	life is strange
	◦	grand theft auto
	◦	Danganronpa (shut up)
	◦	Detroit becomes human
	◦	The forgotten city

-hot gossip sessions (mandatory)"

I was recently admitted to UW-Madison for a research-based MS engineering program in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. However, within the past few months of my own self-study, my research and academic interests have changed a bit, and I am interested in pursuing a research-based MS in the Mechanical Engineering Department.

Does anyone have experience switching grad programs within the College of Engineering/within the same college but across departments/switching grad programs in general at UW-Madison? I really would love the opportunity to pursue a grad engineering degree at this school and want to know how possible this would be. I would probably take broader classes that apply to both fields (like some undergrad pre-reqs I need to catch up on) during my first semester, and then try to switch when it's a little bit underway.

Let me know of your experiences! Thank you!"

I’ve thought about branching into video/4D art and I was wondering if anyone has taken a class under this discipline or has done something similar in their careers from this major or if someone even have comparative experience with the comm arts major as well. I’ve talked to my advisors who’ve given me predictable responses- suggesting art therapy or graphic design (a fading saturated industry in my opinion) and would appreciate any insight/guidance/advice regarding this combination and classes under the video discipline. I would either like to pursue something in the entertainment industry and counseling most likely.

It sounds like the class you’re complaining about, that one discussing discrimination in the workplace, is going swimmingly for you. Thank you for telling everyone within earshot about how awful it is for you. If the room was the size of your ego, everyone else might not be so annoyed. Unfortunately, the room is barely larger than the size of your mind (or perhaps something else) and its relatively compact nature lends itself to an echo chamber (much like those you must fall into online).

Hopefully the density of the affiliated textbooks can permeate the diamond-like density of your skull and make an impression on the incredibly softness of your smooth brain.

I am not thinking I will be the acception. But this is just to do what I can and I will mention later why I ended up thinking my chance is not literally 0. 

Essentially I can verify why I missed Spring regular decision deadline with documents, but they are not obligated to verify them, which makes sense but without an application I can't make the materials deadline. 

I brought up yesterday if maybe what could be implemented back into my case was if this was invalidated and not a justifiable line of reasoning for lateness then the materials would be considered null and void as they would be for any unacceptable reason to miss the deadline so not looked at. Maybe that could be a condition to extend my application and have my materials looked at. Long-shot I know but didn't get concrete answers and over time kept thinking my chances were improving from interaction. 

Last who I was talking which is when I said this was I am guessing a student instructed to tell me no. She wasnt too clear on the reasons and did not know about this situation at all. I think what it is is they don't want to tell me is they don't think the reasoning is ""good enough"" and don't want to be person to say it to the person with this situation. 

Thing is beyond that not being the issue for me(I mean everything is going great right now), as if they said I could make my argument but I would accept it if that's what it is because I knew all of this would probably not be accepted in first place.  But I think I need to have this conversation because from what I gathered I think they misinterpreted certain aspects of the situation. But they are not gonna read my emails or send me to anyone. 

I wasn't spamming them or anything (very few interactions) I think they are doing this because they don't want to offend but assume they have all the understanding neccasary to not give me the chance. I bet they do based off of their criteria but I MAY have the explanation needed though I cannot give it without this conversation which seems I can't have it unless it's a couselor. Which seems like it's not to offend me but you know circles and circles. 

I get its probably been a lost cause from the start but I am 100% going to give it a try even at this point. Though I was wondering which direction I should take. What can I do with this dillilemmna I am having with interacting with the admissions office? Is there anything I can do to get this heard specifically to at least the same capacity? "

How much of a pain is snow and how far out should I get a job from my dorm?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1fyuzov/how_much_of_a_pain_is_snow_and_how_far_out_should/,20,10,2024-10-08 08:32:32,"   So this is kind of a commuting question. I’m from the southern part of the US and deal more with tropical storms and extreme heat rather than snow. I’m trying to find on-campus jobs while possibly getting work experience for my future field. 
   Only problem is that there is nothing that fits those criteria within a 10 min walk of my dorm (or not too many jobs in general). I also have my classes at the beginning of the day so I’ll likely be taking night shifts. As a person of the female gender I also don’t feel all too comfortable commuting too far at night. 
   So here are my questions: Does snow stop buses at any point in the season (and for how long)? Is snow a huge inconvenience I need to worry about for walking to and from places? How often are blizzards a problem? Is it worth it to try and find a job in my field (further out) considering the reasons I’m hesitant to or should I try to stay as close as possible to my dorm even with the limited opportunities? (Also I know safewalk exists but is it really feasible to use it in the winter and if busses are down? Or commonly after night shifts?)

I guess my main concern is I’m worried because in high school I slacked off quite a bit I didn’t really care and I never thought I’d go to college. I have now completed 5 years of college as I completely switched paths after getting my associates either an average combine GPA of roughly 3.4. My high school GPA though is a 2.7. Though I graduated high school over 6 years ago does anyone know the likelihood of how much this will affect my application?

High-masking Neurodivergent roommate ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1fwzbfi/highmasking_neurodivergent_roommate/,36,10,2024-10-05 20:16:55,"Last year, due to the housing rush, I signed a lease with the first person I met. She did look like the kind of person I wanted to live with—very reserved, kind, and genuinely good. We became best friends during our freshman year.

Ever since we moved into our apartment (which is a studio btw), it has been so hard for me to keep up with her because communication is so hard, and also she seems very unemphatic towards me. I hate confronting people directly, if I do it always comes from a place of frustration. That is the only way she listens to me and every time I have to convey something to her I have the hard talk. It genuinely frustrates me and drains my energy.

She is also very unempathetic towards me. I do nice things for her, for example, sometimes cook dinner for her, but she doesn't seem to appreciate those. Neither does she even try to reciprocate (I don't care as a roommate, but we used to be best friends last year). I have made peace with that fact, but she keeps putting me in situations where I have to be there for her. She's always very overwhelmed and emotional and has a breakdown multiple times a week, and I will be a terrible roommate if I just ignore. She also has big boundaries with me, and she doesn't respect mine. She uses my things and then texts me later (absolutely appreciate her telling me), but if I ask for even the most trivial things she says, ""I don't like sharing I'm too individualistic"" Then maybe don't ask for my help either if you're not willing to help back?!

Her mother also seems to be in our business 24/7. She micro-manages her and now me. She even has a say in what toilet paper should we buy. Even after all the things I did for her, her mother sees me as an ""opportunistic"" person. I hate to be seen that way because then her parents (who highly affect her perspective of the world) always assume the worst of me.

I am genuinely frustrated and very close to being depressed because of her. It's not my place to encourage her to get diagnosed because her parents put too much pressure on her to be perfect and ""normal"". I want what's best for her. I don't mean to be rude, and I want to be there for her but it's taking a huge toll on my mental health.

When filling out my schedule for next semester the only class I can really choose is between Ordinary Differential Eq’s and either of the Linear Algebras. 

The rest will be Chem 104, Physics 201 and Intro to Nuclear Eng. I know it’ll be a struggle either way but what class would y’all recommend taking first?

Edit: This is not meant to be a brag statement, but rather advice for succeeding. I ended up getting an 87%, which will likely be an A with the curve. I would highly recommend doing as many practice exams as possible, as well as taking time to make sure you understand every topic. also, write down practice problems and full explanations to them, especially on your notecard. i ended up being so familiar with the processes that i didn’t even need to use my notecard on the actual exam; but it was a good security blanket. It’s meticulous, but go through every problem you can find without any help, and that’ll tell you what you need to know!"

Advice for a hopeless graduate,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1fqb76t/advice_for_a_hopeless_graduate/,29,7,2024-09-27 00:23:21,"I'm a STEM grad student finishing my program in December and I'm feeling overwhelmed right now. I've been applying for all sorts of jobs (paid jobs, internships, in my field, out of my field) and haven’t landed an interview yet. With how bad the job market is, I'm thinking about starting a new graduate degree in a new field because I feel like a living sunk cost fallacy.

But I'm also anxious about switching fields. Graduate programs need references, and I’m worried I haven’t built strong enough relationships with my professors for them to give glowing recommendations. It’s really weighing on me that I'm not a standout student. Asking my undergrad instructors for help feels like a bad idea too because it could come off as extremely sketchy.

Before someone says it, I already have a therapist, but I thought it might help to hear from others who have been in similar situations. How are you handing this job market? If anyone's applied to a graduate program without solid references, what was your approach? Do grad programs pay less attention to recommendations if you already have a graduate degree, or do they expect even stronger letters since you're supposed to have your life together by now?

I’m lucky to have a supportive fiance, so financially I’m ok even if I can't find a job, but I still want to make the most of my education and do something with my life. Any advice, encouragement, or shared experiences would mean a lot to me. I feel like there should be a student org for 'Help! I have no future!'"

1) This entire place was built with a single goal in mind, to be as cheap as humanly possible without constantly falling apart. It's barely been a month since we've been here and we've had to put in multiple maintenance requests for everything from a broken dryer to improperly installed doors and cabinets. I'm not sure about the response times right now but maintenance took over a week to fix some of our problems with us having to pester management till they fixed our dryer while we had wet clothes laying around. The ""wood-style flooring"" is just a nice way of saying extremely cheap vinyl that'll permanently stain if you look at it wrong which is exactly what happened the second we spilled spilledon the kitchen floor. Also in the kitchen I want to quickly mention the genuine quartz countertops that are genuinely the worst quartz anything I've seen. This is on top of not having promised amenities like a ceiling fan in the bedrooms and one of my roommates missing some furniture that was supposed to be in all of our rooms the moment we got here plus all the unfinished concrete ""accents"" being properly filthy with chalk, paint, water marks, and some outdoor gunk for good measure just being stuck to it. This is advertised as being ""luxury"" btw

2) The WiFi issues. I was already plenty upset when the first week of school came around and I had to blow through my phone's data plan cause their backup wifi couldn't even load canvas and, at least from what they told us, they were only having issues since move in day. Then I later found out that the building was supposed to have working full speed wifi a month and a half before move in but they kept lying through their teeth talking about how oh AT&T's doing some maintenance on w/e and the wifi will work just fine tomorrow we promise ;). It took closer to 14 tomorrows for it to finally kick back in but the best part was it started working the same day someone I met here got a wifi hotspot from management and was supposed to return it the same day by 5pm which they couldn't do and were kindly charged an arm and a leg for it by management instead of giving at least a full day's notice as a basic human courtesy

3) The scummy contract. Yes I know pretty much all contracts given to you aren't for your own good but this one's just a special breed of awful as you get to pay 12 whole payments to them for an 11 month contract IF you choose not to resign by September 23rd or pray that someone doesn't snatch your room from you the next day or you want to swap rooms. Regardless, if you just don't want to resign by the rediculous deadline or want to switch to another room in your own apartment well you're gunna have to pay a couple hundred bucks for that. Now god forbid you don't want to pay that then **your lease ends in mid July** while virtually all other campus housing has their lease starting some time in August. They're intentionally putting pressure on anyone renting here to keep renting by doing this or else you risk going weeks of being homeless in Madison which wouldn't be as bad if this place didn't heavily cater to international and out of state students which would have a much harder time with taking their stuff back home if they don't have a friend with enough space to hold onto it

4) The package system. God it's infuriating to know that I'm in some way paying for this garbage luxer package pickup thing when in the first few weeks the entire thing didn't work and they kept the package room door open for the entire day then just closed it at 6pm. You got home late and needed that package before 10am the next day? Well good luck bucko you're waiting for them to come and open it the next day. But now the issue's solved I thought cause we can just unlock the door when we get a package at any time yay but no cause that assumes the delivery drivers scan all the packages and put in our information, which they don't, and you cannot open the door unless you beg someone at the front desk to do it for you which is again, only till 6pm. Plus after hours all your packages will just be left outside so hope it's nothing important

Okay now that I feel better typing this out instead of writing an actual hw essay, I'd love to mention again that you should avoid this place full stop. If all that wasn't enough for you, they've decided to raise rates across the board for this year and our 'current resident lowest pricing' or w/e was still more than what we paid while signing pretty late last year. They said it was through some careful observations of the property market but no this is a flat out lie and they were expecting the prices to go up when a leasing agent let it slip during december of last year. Honestly just go back to the dorms even at least the meal plan's nice"

looking for house recommendations:),https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1fiqdgy/looking_for_house_recommendations/,3,3,2024-09-17 04:54:24,"
hi hi. i am a sophomore looking at houses for the next school year for 5 girls. our budget is anything less than 1000 per person, but preferably closer to 800ish. we don't mind an older house but would prefer it to not be falling apart if we're gonna be paying on the higher end of our budget. one of my roommates found a unit at four seasons with all utilities included but i'm concerned that its managed by madison property management and all the horror stories i've read with mpm not giving a single sht about their cheaper properties, plus the layout is not ideal that there's a massive loft + 4 tinier rooms. alternatively, i've researched a ton of houses managed by tallard llc and have seen great reviews about them, plus i really like how the houses look and the layouts seem much better, but my roommate is concerned that utilities aren't included and thinks we'll be paying way too much in utilities for a house with 5 people. if anyone has any house recs or any advice about how much utilities are, their experiences with mpm/tallard, i'd appreciate it greatly :) thanks guys!"
Organizations for marketing AMA or MKT?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/1fizf8r/organizations_for_marketing_ama_or_mkt/,1,4,2024-09-17 13:35:03,"Hey everyone I have a quick question regarding marketing organizations. Between AMA and MKT at UW-Madison what is in your opinion the better choice? I’ve done AMA at my previous institution and found most of their workshops completely useless and their meetings being time wasters and not engaging, but I can’t speak on Madison’s AMA. (I would like to be optimistic about it) I went to an MKT meeting the other day and didn’t really know how to feel about it. It gave AMA vibes with useless meetings, speakers here and there. The only thing I really enjoyed from AMA last year were the competitions even if me and my buddies were given the information the day before. There was quite a hierarchy where board members got the information weeks in advance and when we’d ask for the information they would tell us they don’t know anything. 

Any advice appreciated, thanks in advance ! "

The main difference is just that it uses R.

She recommended trying to get into STAT 541 intro to biostatistics which is marked as graduate only (is this unusual for a 500?). If I apply, how likely is it to get in as an undergraduate?

I work for the National Student Exchange (NSE), a domestic exchange program. We recently unveiled the NSE Guest program, which allows U.S. undergrads to exchange for a semester to one of our partner campuses in the U.S. There are 40+ campuses to choose from: https://nse.org/exchange/guest/.

NSE Guest students qualify for resident-rate tuition at their host campus. Other expenses include an NSE application fee, NSE placement fee, books, room and board, and transportation. Financial aid may apply.

NSE Guest students take 12-15 credits at their host campus and earn a transcript at the end of the semester. Talk to your home campus about how the NSE credits will transfer into your current degree program.

NSE's most popular destination is the University of Hawaii at Manoa. NSE Guest students pay $8593 plus books, room and board, and transportation. Apply by September 24th: https://nse.org/exchange/apply/. Imagine spending spring 2025 in Hawaii! 

Another great option is Alaska. Tuition and fees are about $7K.
