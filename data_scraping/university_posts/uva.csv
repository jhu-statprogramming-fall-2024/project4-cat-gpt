Students,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1eku6bl/ask_me_anything_for_incoming_and_returning/,37,82,2024-08-05 17:47:26,"Rather than incoming students having to sift through dozens of other posts to see if their questions have been answered before, I thought it would be a good idea to create a thread where these questions can be gathered together.

I welcome all incoming (and returning!) students to ask their questions about housing, course selection, food, social life, and anything in-between within this thread. I'll do my best to answer questions I'm qualified to answer and I encourage other students to chime in as well. Hopefully this post can become a compendium of frequently asked questions. "

I even saw staff workers literally mocking and afterwards joking about a student when she asked about egg allergens at the Newcomb FFC. I have never experienced these levels of hostility before for simply asking if your product contains an allergen.

Organic chemistry tutoring ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1gw41ov/organic_chemistry_tutoring/,0,2,2024-11-21 01:15:48,"www.organicchemistrytutoring.ca

Overwhelmed by organic chemistry? Assignments and tests creeping up on you and feeling like you’re in hot water? Or maybe you’re doing well and need that 95%? Whatever your struggle with organic chemistry may be, I’m here to make sure you succeed. 

Why work with me? 

- Every tutor knows the subject, but not every tutor knows how to transfer that knowledge to a student. I do. 
- I tutor organic chemistry full time, it’s not a hobby or side-gig. When you book with me, you’ll be working only with me, not random people at an agency.
- You’ll be learning problem solving through organic chemistry, which you can apply to many other subjects.
- Your learning will be customized to your specific needs 

Before booking a lesson, let’s chat about your needs, my teaching style, and what you can expect, to see if we’d be a good fit together. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to working with you!

I got one A one B and the rest C’s. I didn’t realize how low C’s bring ur gpa down to. The second semester I did even worse because my dad was going through legal issues. Ended up getting a 1.9 gpa. I got a C in one course a D in bio an F in statistics and withdrew from spanish 102. I couldn’t take any classes in the summer because I was out of the country for months. i’m now retaking all three of the courses bio, stats, and spanish. i’m pretty confidente ill end up with a A in bio this time and a B in spanish. Stats is still hard and i’m doing everything I can to get a C atleast. And my other two classes will most likely be A’s too. The good thing about nova is that they replace the old grade with the new one and re calculate cumulative gpa. However UVA takes the average of the bad old grade and the improved new grade so i feel conflicted. Ive also completed most of the uva transfer requirements im only like two classes shy. I’ve also joined two clubs. Im also taking a winter session course. hopefully that boosts my gpa too. I’m so scared I won’t get in now that i’m not eligible for the GAA. Any advice or low college gpa success stories. I heard colleges like upward trends and that’s what i’m working towards. Please if anyone knows what else i can do to ensure I get in it would be super helpful. "

However, it let me enroll anyways (which I thought was a bit silly since I used the swap tool, I feel like if this sort of issue arises it shouldn't swap without warning first so I don't lose my position in another course) and according to my SIS Degree Progress I have the 120/120 credits to graduate with my current courses even though I've technically already taken 2330 (though under CS not ECE). 

Weirdly, when I go to credit it says ECE2330 is counting as 2 credits, not 3, which isn't technically an issue since it gives me exactly 120 credits to graduate as opposed to 121/120, but is this an issue?

I know I could potentially qualify for guaranteed admission, but I have no interest in actually doing two years at a VCCS. I'd much rather try transferring after a year with 24 credits. That way, I can transfer to a four-year college early and will have more time to choose a major.

If any of you did the same thing I'm planning on doing, would you say that transferring after a year was hard? Do you think it's better to just take courses with transferable credits for a year, or to choose a program and take those classes? I would also appreciate it if y'all could share your general thoughts on what I said.

Since day one, I’ve been planning for this transfer, and it’s been quite a difficult journey. I’ve met with numerous transfer counselors at both my school and UVA, through phone calls, emails, and even in person meetings at UVA. After all of this, it’s clear that no one exactly knows how it works, what specifically counts as a credit, and what specific steps I need to take.

So, I’m reaching out here to hear from students who have been in a similar position. I’d love to hear about your experiences and your thoughts, I’ve listed a few questions below that would be incredibly helpful to include in your response, but any information is appreciated.

Questions:
	1.	How strict is the admission process? If one of my courses doesn’t meet a specific credit requirement, will they throw out my application.

2.	How did you find roommates and Housing? I’d really like to get into Bond House, so any tips on increasing my odds would be fantastic.

3.	How is the social life? Was it challenging to make friends as a transfer student?

Thank you in advance to anyone who’s willing to share their insights."

I am originally a Virginia resident with below average high school stats (3.7 GPA and a 1400 SAT). Good news is that I am currently doing well at Penn State with a 3.9 GPA midway thru the fall semester. I expect to finish with a 4.0 for both the fall and spring semester to strengthen my application. I’m not sure if course rigor has a big impact on transfer admissions but I am currently taking GenEd science classes like Biology and Chemistry as a well as a 200 level physics course. By the time I’ll apply I’ll have completed 21 credits and be in progress for 19 credits (39 credits total and most of which are transfer course requirements for kines)

I think I have a chance because I have lots of extracurriculars (Personal Training work experience/NASM CPT certification, strength and conditioning internship/work experience, athletic training internship, as well as kinesiology research internships here at PSU, youth sports league involvement, competitive pickleball). But seeing that they only accept one or two people for the program each is really nerve wracking and I’m not really sure if my application would be competitive.

I always loved the idea of painting but unfortunately I'm not the best at it. A few months ago though a friend and I came up with a cool idea, what if you could turn any photo you want into a paint by numbers. That way anyone can paint, anything they want.

We looked up custom paint by numbers and found a few Etsy stores selling them but they were way overpriced and most of them didn't even come with the canvas on a frame. So we looked around and talked to a bunch of suppliers, eventually we managed to produce custom paint by number kits cheaper then anywhere else and already framed (you can still order them without a frame but we found most people want them ready to go out of the box).

Long story short though we're trying to grow and get more people talking about us. So we decided it would be a good idea to reach out to some local subreddits and hopefully you'll enjoy them enough to share your experience :)

You can use the code ""COSTPRICEREDDIT"" to get our kits for cost price (our margins are pretty slim right now we want to be as affordable as possible). You can get up to 4 kits at that price so feel free to buy a few and plan a date night, family activity or just get your Christmas shopping done early.

Im alone. I really am. All around me i hear about people getting jobs and offers. Meanwhile I'm just struggling with applications. 

My disorders aren't helping. I've been on the verge of being hospitalized. Mostly... I just feel so isolated. I feel so alone in my struggles. I feel like there really is no one here who understands. I look like a freak. I've struggled with self harm for years. 

I feel like an disappointment. I know I'm doing the right things by networking and tailoring my resumes and asking around and looking at alumni advice and been in contact with the career center since August. I technically have a job now at a new lab.. 

I don't need help with that... so much as... I just feel so isolated. I feel like I'll never get out of my situation. I feel like I'll never be able to live in a stable place where I feel safe. 

I don't want to come across like Lumpy or something where I'm entitled to friends. I don't really have the bandwidth to be a good friend. I have a therapist and psychiatrist. Im on medication. 

I just wish I knew I wasn't alone... I wish I knew that... just... for once I'm not alone. That I'm not alone in struggling like this and that I'm not a freak... or some beast... or failure.

Masters of Systems Engineering?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1geqbs6/masters_of_systems_engineering/,1,0,2024-10-29 09:16:20,"Just curious if any undergrads or grad students had a positive experience with system engineering from UVA? How was the course load/how difficult was it?

I'm currently a masters of engineering - computer science at Virginia Tech remote. I'm failing Intermediate Data Structure/Algorithms, and I really can't see myself coding for living, even if it paid me millions. Kutos to those who can code. I didn't apply myself to the prereq and I just can't see myself putting in the work to be proficient.

So, I'm thinkin of transferring to UVA's Remote Masters of System Engineering. The courses look amazing. I'd really like to get into UX/UI Design, and it looks like I can take 5 or 6 related courses at UVA currently, where as Virginia Tech only offers 1 or 2 online. 

However, I feel like I could get a UX/UI job easy with a masters of engineering at Virginia Tech, and it would be give me more flexibility in the future for jobs and maybe looked at as a bigger accomplishment? But I'd have to suffer and possibly retake the algorithms course again or maybe even a 3rd time.

Also, just curious, how is system engineering at UVA, viewed by employers? Is it better than VT?"

When I lived at home, I would just wait for my parents to go to bed and sneak out to one of our sheds and turn on the speaker. However, now that I’m stuck in a dorm I have nowhere private to go where others won’t hear me, and keeping my mouth shut for this long has actually been driving me insane. Additionally, I’m a metal screamer, so even if I did get over my self-consciousness I would quickly be considered a public nuisance. I have no interest in choir. I also checked out University Records and their practice rooms, but there’s no open bookings for the foreseeable future, and I’m also not associated with a band.  I need a place where I can be loud without worry. Are there any clubs that would be able to help out with that, or “secret” spaces that are walkable/bikeable from grounds? I’m also considering joining a band in the future—how does that work generally? How do people find each other? Is it all one club or are there multiple based on genre/subgenre?"

I was taking the early premed classes last year and that definitely lowered my GPA, however this year I switched to an economics major.

 like a lot of the courses im in right now and will take towards my major use the default university grading scale, which is a 95 for an A (4.0). even a 94 takes you down to an A- (3.7). I'll be applying to graduate schools like PA school or med school that really emphasize high GPA. 

For my classes, I feel that getting an 92-93+ is pretty reasonable, but getting a 95+ for an A seems really difficult even if I put in work and do good on everything. like even a few points off here and there leads me to below 94, which isn't bad but will affect my gpa. u

va has challenging courses already and I was wondering how grad schools would look at my gpa with the difficult grading scale. 

also, I think transcripts only show the letter grade (A-, A, A+) so that letter will be based off the grading scale and affect my gpa. is this putting me at a disadvantage?

I hope you are having a blessed week thus far. I am a current spring 2025 second year undergraduate transfer applicant to UVA. This is my 3rd time applying to UVA, (including a transfer application to start this fall, as well as Early Actioning my senior year of high school). UVA is my dream school, and despite being rejected twice, I am not yet discouraged from trying to attend. I believe my grades show a positive upward trend from my high school years to now.
I have worked hard to be as well rounded as a person as I can be, by participating in sports, service, and helping with my community. I've had 5 internships in the field of which I intend to study, and have tried demonstrating as much interest in UVA as I can. I understand that UVA is an extremely prestigious university, and I would be humbled and grateful beyond belief to attend, I understand there are many other great applicants, and I've tried to set myself apart as a candidate for admission as well as following the course credits UVA recommends for transfer applicants.
I know that spring transfer admission is even more difficult and competitive than fall transter was, and I'm starting to feel my lifelong dream of attending UVA slipping out of my grasp.
I am curious to know what more I can do to make myself standout from a crowd of so many deserving individuals, and was hoping you could provide r with some insight as to how I can improve my chances of admission.

Apologies for the long winded message, I hope  you have a great rest of your day. "
ACM International Collegiate Programming Competition - Practice and contest at Virginia Tech,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1g9jm6v/acm_international_collegiate_programming/,23,2,2024-10-22 14:34:15,"Hey everyone, especially those of you who like leetcode, Advent of code, Codeforces, etc., or those just looking to improve their programming skills

CS Professor McBurney here - UVA has a successful history with ICPC - International Collegiate Programming Competition. In the last season, a team of three students from UVA reached the international competition in Astana, Kazakhstan!

This year, we have been practicing **Tuesday nights, 6-8p.m.** in Olssen 011 with weekly contests of programming problems (these contests are available remotely, but at least some in-person attendance is required to go to regionals). We have such a practice tonight and next week.

Well, on **Saturday, November, 16,** we are hoping to send 10 3-person teams to **Virginia Tech** for a chance to earn a spot in the National Competition! This is always a great chance to beat the Hokies, and while I'm not a UVA alum myself, growing up in southern West Virginia, I learned to never miss an opportunity to beat the Hokies.

**If you are interested in participating**, attend the regular practice tonight and next week (**Tuesday, 6-8p.m.** in Olssen 011).

Our **local competition** among UVA teams to decide who gets to travel to Virginia Tech will be **Saturday, Nov. 2, 10a.m. - 2p.m.** (location pending, but hopefully Rice Hall 130).

Some more info on the competition follows, but happy to answer any follow-ups:  
1) Teams are 3 people, but we already have multiple 2 person teams looking for a third. We have teams that are more casual, as well as teams setting their sights on globals, as well as all levels in between.

2) All UVA students can participate, you don't have to be a CS Major, but you should be familiar with programming.

3) There are 2 distinct levels of competition. **Division 1** is the ""premier"" division where you are competing for nationals. Problems tend to be challenging, and many will require some knowledge of algorithms. On the other hand, newer programmers or less experienced programmers may enjoy **Division 2**, which often has easier problems that require less algorithm knowledge. Be aware only Division 1 can advance to nationals, but Division 2 can advance to Virginia Tech and still beat the Hokies

4) Programming languages supported are: Java, Python, C, C++, and Kotlin (the greatest language of all time according to 50% of bald CS Teaching Track Faculty in the CS Department at UVA)

5) While these are competitions, it's a great opportunity to learn leetcode style algorithms and practice them!

If interested, feel free to reply or email me at mcburney at virginia dot edu !

Hope to see some new faces tonight!"

Any advice? it's so bad it's literary caused me to spend ungodly amounts of time trying to understand things that don't directly correlate or relate to my performance in a class (I've failed exams because of this bad habit) 

I feel like if I just accepted things as they are, I would save so much time, which I could be spending on yielding more topics and learning more generally.   
  
I need to accept this isn't a PhD program where I need to know why someone invented an algorithm or why certain things work the way they do to the deepest atomic level.

I am a senior planning on applying to UVA, VCU, and William & Mary as a pre-med. Currently, my plan is to ED to UVA for Neuroscience (and I think I have a good chance of getting in). But my dilemma stems in my fear of fitting in to the right school. I am an ambivert, so I can be kind of an introvert in terms of social recharging, but when I am around others, I get quite energized. I also hope the college I go to has a great social life like parties, a big sports culture, and huge school spirit. That is why UVA is my top school. But here's the thing: I don't know if I would suit that social life. In high school, I've always been kind of a person who is more of a homebody and has always been more academically focused. But a big part of why I was like that was because I have strict parents, so even when I wanted to go out and stuff, I couldn't really go to parties. Also, my high school is not really big on sports or school spirit. So, I guess my real question is should I even try that lifestyle out (I really do want to try) if there is a chance I won't fit in?

Also, would the social life at VCU or William & Mary fit me better? Thank you so much for your time in reading this post :))"

UVA's my top school, and I think I have a pretty good chance of admission. I have a couple questions about the McIntire school, since I'm interested in finance.

1. What is the First Writing Requirement? Could AP classes fill that requirement? I have a 5 on Lang, and I might take the Lit test this year. I'm a bit confused on how FWR+ placement via portfolio review works, does it mean in order to take the FWR classes I have to pass the portfolio review?
2. I got a 5 on Micro, so does this mean I've fulfilled the Microeconomics requirement?
3. Why do some classes end in T? For example, if I had gotten a 4 on Micro, I would've gotten credits for Micro 1000T, so would that have gotten me the Micro requirement for McIntire?
4. Can AP Calc AB/BC, Stats, and/or Psych fill the Quantification, Computation, and Data Analysis requirement? I've already taken AB and Stats with both 5s, and taking Psych and BC now.
5. If I've taken four years of Spanish in middle and high school, is it still recommended to take another year at UVA? I didn't take it senior or junior year, so it'd be a bit of a shock to go back. Would there be a placement test?
6. I have no experience in coding or computer science, but I have a 5 on AP Stats, so I'm assuming I'll have to take ""STAT 1602: Introduction to Data Science with Python"" first year. Is this correct? Will I need anything else to be successful with coding-related courses and assignments?

The reason for this is I don't want to move my couch out (I just don't want to hire a truck and take it to the landfill). The couch is in good condition, having cost several thousand dollars when purchased several years back, but I have zero use for it after this year. The apartment is a 2x2 that will be $975 a room with everything included but utilities. Please let me know if you're interested. The place is nice, but I just really don't want to deal with that couch. On the other hand, if anyone is interested in a free leather couch, DM me. I will need it until May, but after that, it's yours! (I'm not moving it out though). I am trying to do this asap, so dm me, and I'll happily give ya a tour.

diversity- statistically UVA has more diversity than VT but when i visited the campuses VT looked so much more diverse than UVA so I was confused.

Looking for a roomie ,https://i.redd.it/zwbffluw0tsd1.jpeg,10,0,2024-10-04 21:05:12,"Hi everyone! 

I’m a third year student at UVAs school of education and human development and I’m looking for a roommate to take over my current roommates lease when she moves out.

Some info about me: I like to spend my down time at home, but I also enjoy going out occasionally and hosting dinner/small get togethers. During the week I have classes, go to the gym, and go to a local ceramic studio. 

As for housing: 
I’m currently looking for a roommate for my 2 bed 1 bath apartment off of Arlington blvd from June 2025-June 2026. My current roommate is moving out in June for grad school. I have fully furnished the shared spaces so you would only need your personal items and kitchen supplies! I’m hoping to find someone that is quiet and tidy, but would also like to be friends. 

About the unit: 
The pet limit for this location is 2 pets, so unfortunately no other animals are allowed. Rent is a little over $900 a month plus electricity and internet (about $120 a month). Base rent ($900) includes water, sewage, pest control, parking, and trash. This location has on-site laundry, a pool, and a BBQ (which is wonderful for the summer)! This location is also on UVAs bus route (gold) which is super convenient. Also must be ok with living with someone in the LGBTQ community. 

I have attached a photo of the units floor plan. The room that is available is the smaller room (10’x12’) but I pay more in rent to make up for the difference. The unit is also on the 3rd (top) floor so we get lots of natural light, no bugs, and no noisy neighbors above.

I'm currently deciding between applying Early Decision to UVA and attending the McIntire School of Commerce or going to Cornell's Nolan Hotel School, with the goal of breaking into investment banking (IB), private equity (PE), or consulting. I’ve also considered Cornell’s Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management, but the acceptance rates are so low that I don’t think it’s realistic for me.

I have very strong business-oriented extracurriculars, though none of them are hospitality-related, except for being the president of the entrepreneurship club at my school. Eventually, I’m looking to secure job placements in NYC, so that’s a major factor in my decision-making process.

Given my goals of working in IB, PE, or consulting, I’m trying to figure out which path would give me the best opportunities post-graduation. For those with experience in these fields, which school would you recommend and why?

Any advice on the strength of alumni networks, recruiting, and career outcomes from either McIntire or Nolan—particularly with a focus on NYC placements—would be super helpful!

Thanks in advance!"

Everyone, make sure you get registered before the Close of Books on **Tuesday, October 15**! (Paper registrations must be in our hands by 5pm that day, and electronic changes must be made by 11:59pm.) *All buildings with an apartment/unit must include their apartment/unit! If we have to contact you, it may delay your registration.*

And again, if you're at all unsure, or if you've been to the DMV for anything lately, please check your registration! *If you're updating your registration online, make sure you triple check which information you're submitting. And don't submit multiple entries within a few minutes of each other because it can sometimes cause voters to get pushed to other localities!* 

Same Day Registration will be available after October 15th, BUT in most instances, you will only be able to complete a Provisional ballot and it won't go in the scanner that day. (If you have moved within the City of Charlottesville in the past 12 months, ask us for more info because you may be eligible for a regular ballot under Mover's Rules.)

Maybe it's because I’m a transfer student, and I imagine this would be common at any top business program or any top program in general. But now, I really don’t know what I want to do with my life anymore. Because I transferred, I missed out on every IB and consulting opportunity available.

I wish I had taken things slower and explored more fields. When I share this with people, their response is always something like, ""The Comm School opens doors for people.""

FAANG fangirls,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1fq98a8/faang_fangirls/,0,3,2024-09-26 22:46:33,"please give this a read:

""There are a lot of CS majors who aspire to work for the FAANG/MAMAA companies the same way some high schoolers aspire to get into Ivy League universities. As a former Amazon engineer who worked on the AWS Virtual Private Cloud service back in 2017-2018, let me explain to you what is wrong with that line of thinking.

The first thing you need to keep in mind about any real job is that work is normally exploitative, and big tech jobs are no exception. They give great starting salaries compared to other junior developer positions, sure, but there's a catch. They lose money on you during your first year working there with no experience with the expectation that they will make that money back from your labor later on when you know what you're doing there. Big tech companies like Amazon and Facebook often use their own, internal, company-specific tools that aren't used at other companies. For example, Facebook created and uses the Hack programming language that nobody else uses (it started as an offshoot of PHP with types added and became its own seperate programming language sort of like how C++ started as C with classes and then became its own seperate thing). Amazon's core services run on Amazon's unique internal deployment engine called \[Apollo, which you can read about\]. Most companies put their applications that run on servers in containers like Docker, deploy/scale their containers with say Kubernetes, and can use the AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) that handles the deployment and scaling of your containerized apps automatically. For building, they may use a common, open source build system like Maven for Java, sbt (Scala Build Tool) for Scala, or whatever build system your programming language normally uses.

The problem with only using and mastering tools that are only used by one specific employer like say Facebook or Amazon is that they don't teach you what is commonly used outside of that company, so what you were taught isn't as readily transferable to another employer if you get fired or choose to leave. Essentially, there is some ""employer lock in"". You may look around at the facilities at say Amazon or Google and go ""golly, gee, there's the Super Smash Bros videogame in the lunch room as well as games and free food, wow"", but that stuff isn't just there to make you happy, it's part of the ""employer lock in"" to keep you from leaving. Once you're locked in and are acquainted with their tools and processes and stuff, they're making profit off of you. If you instead worked at a ""regular"" company using ""regular"" commonly used software tools like say (on the backend) the [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core framework if you're coding in C# or Spring Boot for Java Spring, or perhaps React if you're doing frontend JavaScript development, you will have skills that you are already deeply familiar with that you can immediately transfer over to another company. At Amazon the backend was in Java which is a common programming language, sure, but they used their own unique custom internal framework called \[CORAL framework\] which I think had some Java Spring in it but was a totally custom thing, not the usual stuff that's used at other companies with Java backends. Also, unlike with common open source frameworks and tools, there are no books on say CORAL Framework or the Hack language that you can buy on Amazon and read before bed the way there is for say Java Spring or Docker or whatever (which is an issue for me personally because I learn by reading technical books).

When the money supply shrinks or a recession happens causing layoffs, or your performance isn't great, you can get fired, and when that happens you want to be able to find another job quickly and be useful at that job. Sure, having ""Amazon"" at the top of your resume gets the attention of recruiters from India on LinkedIn, but once you get past that stage you have to actually demonstrate your usefulness to prospective employers on their particular system. I've had prospective employers tell me, as part of their interview/hiring process, ""build a JSON API that can be used to play a simple card game"" or something like that, where the deck of cards is represented as an array of integers. I can't build that HTTP REST API with Amazon's CORAL Framework because that framework doesn't exist outside of Amazon. Instead I have to learn some common, open source framework that is generally used, like maybe Java Spring Boot or Express on Node.js for backend JavaScript. And like if I work for Facebook and I've been exclusively programming in the Hack programming language for 4 years and then all of a sudden I get fired because there's a recession, I can't do the coding interview at other companies in the Hack language, other company's coding test probably doesn't even support it. I have to learn and use something more common that other people and companies know, use, and support.

So definitely keep that in mind and have a second/backup tech stack and skill set handy with demo projects that use it in case you ever get fired and need to find another employer outside of the FAANG/MAMAA companies. Ultimately a job is just an exchange of your time for money and an employer is just a source of money. Some people embrace the idea of living to work, but really you should be working to live. Before you accept an offer, establish how many hours a week you will be working so you can have a life outside of work. Don't make your employer think that putting in Herculean (like Hercules) effort is the norm, causing you to get burnt out in the long run. First and foremost, watch out for yourself. Amazon is just another company, and they will put their customers, their shareholders, and their leadership before you, their worker.""

**TLDR:** Working for big tech companies like FAANG/MAMAA isn't always ideal for career growth.

The initial batch of mail ballots went out yesterday, the 19th. **If you know you have a ballot coming, please wait until your ballot arrives.** If wish to avoid delays or issues with returning it via USPS, you can either put your completed ballot in our monitored dropbox 24/7 or hand it into someone in our office during office hours.

Just a reminder to be careful and always double check your registration data using the [Citizen Portal](https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation) or by contacting your local office. We do not share a database with DMV, and we've had several voters get pushed out of Cville and into their old localities after transactions at DMV. (This is especially true of new city residents/students registering away from their permanent residence.) **PLEASE** make sure you check your registration and make any corrections before October 15. After that, updates to registration will either be delayed or a Same Day Registration/Provisional ballot situation.

MS Commerce Eligibility Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1flpu8f/ms_commerce_eligibility_question/,2,2,2024-09-20 23:40:28,"Hello all,

I have a quick question about the eligibility for entrance to the MS Commerce program (marketing and management concentration).

Currently I will graduate with a bachelors degree in sport, outdoor recreation, and tourism management with minors in business administration and economics. 

I have seen in the class profile that others with a sport managment major have been admitted into the program, but I wanted to ask if my business administration minor will be too much business-designated coursework for me to be admitted into the MS Commerce. The Econ minor should be fine, as economics majors are allowed into the program. 

It is also worth noting that my major (sport, outdoor recreation, and tourism management) is housed in the human health and performance department at my university. It shares the same department as exercise science. Therefore, besides the minor, the only other business-designated class I took was a statistics class. 

Thanks in advance, and all input will be welcome."

I know this question has probably been asked a million times by now, and it might seem a bit odd, but I’d love to get some of your insights on the transfer process. Specifically, what were your stats coming in, what do you think helped you get accepted, and where did you transfer from?

I currently attend NVCC, a 3.8 GPA majoring in Engineering and Biology. My high school stats were pretty bad. Could it possibly have a negative impact on my application? I understand as a 3rd year transfer they aren’t as important.

I applied to UVA for the School of Engineering, but I don’t have the smallest idea of my chances. Yes, I understand chances are higher as a transfer, and I made sure to follow the transfer course guide closely, completing all the required courses. I also submitted my Common App early (on August 1st), which means it doesn’t include my current semester or spring 2025.

how can I make sure that my most recent semesters are accounted for in my application? Do I need to submit another transcript, or is there an informal place to upload these updates?

I know this post is all over the place but I appreciate any insight."

Take new classes, meet new people, and have new adventures!

NSE Guest students qualify for resident-rate tuition at their host campus. Other expenses include an NSE application fee, NSE placement fee, books, room and board, and transportation. Financial aid may apply.

NSE Guest students take 12-15 credits at their host campus and earn a transcript at the end of the semester. Talk to your home campus about how the NSE credits will transfer into your current degree program.

NSE's most popular destination is the University of Hawaii at Manoa. NSE Guest students pay $8593 plus books, room and board, and transportation. Apply by September 24th: https://nse.org/exchange/apply/. Imagine spending spring 2025 in Hawaii!

I've done what people have said to do. I've joined a club, rushed, talked to people at dinning halls, etc. and now in a residential college dorm and still not a single friend. Only acquaintances that I barely speak to. It's very depressing here at UVA. I had hoped my experience would be great and I could get a degree from a prestigious school, make friends, find a parter, etc. and just live that typical college experience, but so far it's proving to be otherwise. I've never been so alone/lonely in my life. I guess I just don't have anything in common with anyone here. Regardless of how big the school is.

Right now, I'm leaning towards BS in behavioral neuroscience, but I was just wondering if either BA or BS have significant pros over the other that I'm overlooking. Hoping someone in either program currently can help me out.

Looked at all the classes for both of the majors and they both have good curricula. 

Also, I'm kinda drawn towards computational neuroscience so I was wondering if I could take CS/Stats classes like DSA, discrete math, etc.. If I was in the College of Arts and sciences, or can you not take those classes since they're only for engineering students?

PSA: Windows is officially the recommended operating system for most* of the engineering school,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1ffaass/psa_windows_is_officially_the_recommended/,37,41,2024-09-12 18:54:11,"Given that this is after the semester started and many people have already purchased their laptops, sadly this is probably too little too late for many people but perhaps someone will find this post in the future and find this helpful. 

**Why you should know**: a lot of engineering software can only be installed on Windows. This means you may will be unable to use necessary software for some of your classes or extracurriculars. Professors may attempt to make accommodations for you, but I’ve met dozens of people who have suffered from inadequate accommodations and just wished they bought a windows laptop in the first place. 

This didn’t use to be a big problem when macs used intel processors and could run bootcamp to run windows, but for the past few years the M series / apple silicon chips use a completely different computer architecture and bootcamp has been discontinued. As far as I am aware, there are no free alternatives. Microsoft officially recommends to use the virtual machine service Parallels which requires a yearly subscription. (They at least have a student discount)

My understanding is that the engineering administration is opposed to financing things like parallels for students and says that students should factor the price of software required to run windows software into the price of choosing their computer. 

This is most problematic for mechanical, aerospace, and civil engineering but I have heard of problems in other programs as well. For example , I know the MAE department CAD course requires SolidWorks and the students with macs are required to pay for Parallels out of pocket. The university does provide free licenses to SolidWorks through the software catalog, so windows students don’t need to pay anything. 

Not planning on one of those three degree programs? **You should probably still get Windows (unless you are positive you won’t need any Windows software).** There are dozens of engineering clubs that also rely on software that can only be installed on Windows. Many people are trying to join clubs and are realizing that they effectively can’t join if they have a MacBook because they can’t contribute without the required software. 

Again, I’ve heard the most problems associated with the clubs closely related to mechanical, aerospace, and civil engineering such as Motorsports, HoosFlying, MARS, Solar Car, Concrete Canoe, Rocketry, etc. but I have heard of other organizations that have had issues with mac users as well. 

If there’s even a chance you may switch your major or may be interested in one of these organizations, I strongly recommend getting a Windows **laptop**. 

\* Caveat: To the disgruntlement of many engineering professors and engineering clubs, [the advice given to incoming engineering students on laptop purchasing has become murkier and less helpful over the past few years](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty-staff/office-information-technology). The official recommendation found online now is 

> we recommend to new first-year students that if you have a functioning computer that is less than 3 years old that you continue to use it at UVA for your first year. Plan then to purchase a new computer at the end of your first year when you know your major and your computer needs.

A couple years ago, it was true that the official blanket recommendation for all incoming eschool students was to get a windows laptop and it explicitly recommended against purchasing a mac. The reason for the shift in advice is because some departments in engineering (mostly CS) are very mac user friendly and some CS professors actually daily drive MacBooks. They made the advice looser to reflect this but imo they only caused more problems because Macs have become more popular among students in the past few years which has caused problems for the clubs and departments that aren’t able to be OS flexible. I wish they would edit that last sentence to be “Plan then to purchase a new computer at the end of your first year when you know if you’re a CS major or not.” Most departments still recommend Windows, and for CS Windows and Mac are equally viable. 

**Edit**: If you know you won’t need any windows only software in any of your courses, electives, or extracurriculars, then it doesn’t matter and is entirely up to your personal preference. I have edited my wording slightly to reflect that. 

To be clear, I don’t think that Windows is the best operating system and I’m not trying to argue it’s better than Mac or Linux or anything else. I’m only trying to call attention to the fact that some software used by some clubs, research labs, and courses require a windows operating system and right now the only way to use those software on Macs is to pay for a subscription to Parallels out of pocket.

APMA 2120 back to 1110?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1fdpyyg/apma_2120_back_to_1110/,1,5,2024-09-10 19:04:38,"I am a first-year engineering student, and I am enrolled in Professor Mahmood's APMA 2120 Multivariable Calculus class. I have noticed that his teaching style does not appeal to my learning abilities, and find myself struggling in the class. I switched in from Professor Pisano's 1110 Calculus II course, but I was able to move up a level due to my Dual Enrollment credits coming through last Friday. I am coming into Calculus 3 a week late, but I have caught up on the material since. However, I have been to every one of his office hours, and I still find myself just as confused. I have relied on my classmates to guide me through thus far, as Professor Mahmood only posted his TA help hours yesterday. I even emailed Professor Hellings (higher rated Calc III professor) last week asking for advice or TA hours, but I assume he is busy with his own students.

My options are to: 
1. Stay in APMA 2120 with Mahmood, take the first (and maybe second) exam with him, and drop the course if I continue to do poorly (drop date is mid-October). However, this would eliminate the ability for me to drop back down to Calculus 2, as I would miss the add course date (today). I would also risk losing a semester of math if I dropped.

2. Switch back into Pisano's APMA 1110 class (she has open seats). Is it worth it for me to switch back this late in the semester? I know the course is fast-paced, and 3 weeks is a long time, but I did take DE Calculus II in high school. SIS is also strict about swapping APMA courses, so Pisano would have to grant me permission online for it to go through (I have already emailed her).

I have also heard that Calculus 2 and Calculus 3 do not have so much curriculum overlap, as Calculus 3 uses more basic calculus but involving vectors and 3-D surfaces. Is this true? 

If so, I could drop down to 12 credits this semester, go without an APMA, and try for Professor Hellings for Multivariable next semester. I am enrolled in 16 credits for this semester, so dropping Calculus would leave me at 12 (minimum for Engineering school). I am not concerned though, becaus all of my HSS Elective and Math/Science Elective credits from AP/DE high school credits satisfy the graduation requirements. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

The job is what it sounds like -- the company seems grassroots, on the ground perspectives on how people like you view Abercrombie. I think submitting some thoughts from people would really start some discussion in HQ (which is in Ohio) whether or not I get hired.

(1) Would you wear Abercrombie and Fitch clothing?
(2) Have you ever worn Abercrombie?
(3) Are your children or younger relatives currently interested in Abercrombie?
(4) Abercrombie got its first woman CEO in 2018, who undertook a major revamping and restructuring of the company's aesthetic. How many times would you say you have been in an Abercrombie store since 2018? Did you like it? Why or why not?
(5) Do you remember what the first or one of the first Abercrombie items you ever bought was? What kind of events did you wear it to?
(6) Do you like Hollister?
(7) Would you describe yourself as having been popular in college?
(8) Have you ever worn ripped jeans?
(9) Did you ever go to abercrombie.com in the 2000s to listen to Abercrombie radio?
(10) How likely are you to listen to one of the Abercrombie store music playlists that exist on Spotify or YouTube, upon learning that such things exist?
(11) How would you describe the relevance/importance of Lisa Birnbach' sOfficial Preppy Handbook to a 24 year old Abercrombie employee?
(12) Is Abercrombie Preppy?
(13) The post-2018 version of Abercrombie values diversity. Lisa Birnbach herself also added more diversity to True Prep, the second version of her Preppy Handbook, such as the Obamas. What does diversity mean to you?

(15) Who is your personal fashion role model among celebrities?
(16) What is your favorite outfit you've ever worn?

"Considering a ""gap"" semester - thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1fcbjil/considering_a_gap_semester_thoughts/,9,9,2024-09-08 23:33:56,"So a bit of context; I am currently a ""fourth"" year in the engineering school majoring in computer science. The reason why I say ""fourth"" is because I am on track to finish a year early. I started my education here August 2022 however I talked to my advisor and officially bumped my class standing one year higher. I am considering a gap for the following reasons in order of importance:

1. I really want to allocate some time to myself to spend carefree before entering the job market. It sounds lame, but I've done nothing but cram my semesters and overwork myself so I do want a ""break"" from all of it. I know it won't be as easy to seek vacation once I start working as a new hire, so I want to find that time while I can.

2. I started off without being in a good mental state, and my current self would have appreciated it if I had taken a gap year before starting my education. Again, I just want a good 2-3 months to unwind from all of it (for context, I'm taking 17 credits total including CSO2 + DMT2 + SDE2 AND have an internship I am working this fall).

3. Financials. I took out a couple of cards to pay off for this semester, which begin accruing interest next year around late September. I ran some hypotheticals in my mind and came to the conclusion that even if I got a job straight after graduation, I would not be able to pay off my cards before I get charged interest on the cards I have maxed out unless I land a really good paying job. It is much more safer for me to work a minimum wage job (worst case) to pay off for this semester, and take out a loan the following semester.

4. Build more experience. I really want to have a few more internships under my resume. I am hoping for both a spring and summer internship. If not, work on a few really fun personal projects I have brainstormed.

I wanted to get insight for a couple of things before actually taking the gap.

- ""Explain this gap in your education?"" I am anticipating this to be asked by future employers. With the reasons I have provided, would taking the gap be an unwise choice? Would the gap ultimately hurt my employment chances in the long run?

- With the upcoming career fair, should I be networking for jobs or summer internships? My nametag will have ""2025"" on it, so I'm guessing employers would be confused if I talked about looking for internships. A few companies were telling me about jobs during the 2024 spring career fair.

- Is this even allowed? How would I even go about making it official? So far, I've thought about contacting the Dean of engineering, SFS, and UVA housing. Housing is a pretty big deal for me actually. I am living in a residential dorm (same room as last year) which I was able to get by reapplying for housing last year. I love where I live and would love to stay here for my final semester. Would taking this gap not allow me to have guaranteed housing for my last semester? Will I get a bad enrollment time for my classes in my last semester?

Sorry for the huge wall of text, but this is a pretty big decision I need to make. I would appreciate all the advice I could get!"

On grounds vs Off grounds?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1fbphha/on_grounds_vs_off_grounds/,11,26,2024-09-08 04:22:23,"What are some of the advantages to living off grounds compared to on grounds aside from price?

I'd argue on grounds housing tends to be managed better and comes with utilities included, not to mention living on grounds means you live in close proximity to classes. Especially considering the new housing options on Brandon Ave., on grounds housing looks very appealing.

I originally went off grounds after my first year to save a little bit on housing and I had to sacrifice a lot in terms of apartment quality and proximity. Housing rates are rising steadily while on grounds rates have more or less stayed the same (or at least it seems that way to me). A friend of mine is now a first year and therefore has to consider housing options for next year. I just can't think of any compelling reasons to live off grounds, so I'd like to hear others' opinions."

CC Transfer FOMO,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1fat0de/cc_transfer_fomo/,2,8,2024-09-06 23:19:58,"I'm going to transfer to the e-school next fall with an associate's degree under the GAA (assuming I don't screw anything up massively). I like my community college and I'm really grateful for the time spent there: I've had the chance to meet a lot of interesting people, I'm saving money, and I'm pretty involved in the (albeit small compared to UVA's) student life on campus, but I can't help but worry about missing out on things. 

  
Is it really possible to fully belong at UVA only spending two years there? I wanted to go here and not just commute to the local 4 year school partially because of wanting the ""college experience"" (another factor was the higher % of female engineering students), but is that really a realistic desire? Looking at previous posts here, it seems like most transfer students aren't even able to live on grounds. I also know classes at UVA are going to be much harder than at community college, especially for an engineering degree, and I'm worried that'll make it even harder to find time for making friends and participating in activities.

  
I also have struggled a lot with making friends at community college, and I know some of that is probably the environment, but I also fear that maybe something is fundamentally wrong with me, and that my social deficits combined with being a transfer student will make me feel even lonelier. 



I guess I'm mostly looking for reassurance, but don't be afraid to be brutally honest if you need to be. Thank you for your help. "

Hi there everyone,

As the title says i have made a survey to find out how i can help you guys find better connections and professional opportunities.

Im a student myself and i know how difficult it is to find like minded individuals in university that share similar interests.

Its generally considered difficult to find individuals with that you can just co work with or share ideas with. Next to that it becomes harder and harder to find the right job or internships for CS students.

Because of this i started a initiative with fellow students to find out how i can help other students potentially solve this problem in the future.

I have made a short survey that takes approximately 3 minutes of your time that gives us a clear overview on how we can help you out!

Here is the link :)

Please realize that finding fulfilling relationships in and of itself is a journey worth taking. Friends are usually made in the most random places, at the most unexpected times. Focus on finding your own priorities and interests, what makes you feel good, and wherever you land you'll find people.  

Please take things slowly and prioritize yourself. All the advise you'll get from reddit has already been made, what's left is finding who you are, finding spaces you enjoy, and finding the courage to start a conversation with ppl in those spaces. And if you're afraid of approaching someone, just know that the reward of potentially gaining a friend is much higher than the nervousness that you're feeling. 

  
Ik reddit is a place to rant and connect with others so I'm not trying to dissuade ppl from posting- but I hope this helps someone out there. Coming from a former (and probably future) lonely person, college and adult life is scary for everyone, and loneliness is inevitable. So use those periods of your life to find yourself and experience new connections.  

And to those who (shall not be named) feel spitefull because of this loneliness- there is no vendetta against you. We're all here for the same reason.

So in may case (as far as I understand it), I would receive a degree in Aerospace Engineering on my diploma, and on my transcript it would show that I double majored in English.  Is this correct?

Second, how does that look to companies?  If I were to say wish to teach would I appear qualified in English?  ie. does it only appearing on my transcript negatively impact its validity in the job-sphere?"

I'm leaning more towards 6th or 7th semester. From people who had studied abroad before can you let me know your feedback?

Also I'm just worried if I do 5th semester, it's also the time I'll be applying internships and interviews for CS and stuff.

I would like to study abroad during the school year because it is covered within my scholarship, but if I do it over the summer or winter break, I will probably have to get a loan. If you still think I should do it over these times anyways and get a loan I'm cool with that as well.

- first gen white male at a title 1 school in va
- 4.26 gpa weighted (school doesn’t do unweighted)
- class rank: 26/240, will be decently higher by the end of my senior year
- applying ed to the engineering school or college of arts and sciences (I want to major in chemical engineering or chemistry)
- applying test optional most likely

ECs:
- paid internship working in the archives of the communications department for a national level organization of mine workers
- 4 year varsity lacrosse player, captain, 2nd team all region honors, United States Marine Corps distinguished male athlete award, all-area honorable mention
- ambassador for Morgan’s message for my schools chapter since sophomore year, which is a mental health organization for student athletes (I take a lot of pride in mental health)
- National Honor Society
- Key Club
- Youth in Philanthropy 
- 4 year coach and camp counselor for a youth lacrosse camp
- 4 year volunteer vendor and organizer for rallies for retired mine workers in West Virginia 
- Varsity golf senior year
- varsity club, which is a club for varsity athletes that you have to apply to, we boost school spirit and are positive role models for the under classmen
- as well as various volunteering such as environmental things and food packaging

Academics: 
- 7 APs, 2 honors, 2 dual enrollment
- my school doesn’t offer many APs as it is and decided to tell us on the first day of school that they were no longer offering AP calc, therefore I’m taking it through community college
- senior year classes: AP Gov, AP stats, DE English, Applied Calc (was my only option), Physics (we also apparently only offer regular physics this year too)
- received awards for outstanding student in Algebra 2 sophomore year and outstanding student in AP chem junior year
- principals honor roll every year except senior because it hasn’t ended yet

Essays: 
- my common app essay has the potential to be really strong it just needs some revision, it’s about how a hike taught me to approach my goals differently
- uva supplemental will also be very strong, it’s about my changed perspective on mental health
More about my hs:
- my school is title 1 so very low income 
- teachers here (especially math) barely teach some of their classes leaving the students to work issues out for themselves
- they fail to hire qualified teachers or fail to hire teachers at all and inform us about these issues on the first day of school as I’ve said before
(Forgot to mention that I am also coming from a lower middle class family)

Conclusion:
I really really want to go to uva for many reasons, the first being its academics of course, the second being that I love the grounds there and Charlottesville is very similar to my hometown which is great because I get very homesick, and of course the third being that it’s close to home only about an hour away. 

I would really appreciate it if you all could chance me, I understand that UVAs admissions are somewhat random but if I could gain at least a little insight on what my chances are it would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks!

(Forgot to mention to that I will possibly have another EC that I would most likely replace varsity club with. It’s another mental health club that I will have to apply for and they are only accepting several applicants to take leadership roles. I will update if I get that position)

Should I apply to college of arts and sciences and transfer into e-school or do I have an equal chance either way?"

dirty rush ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1f4dlj9/dirty_rush/,8,2,2024-08-29 21:08:51,i’m a first year and new to the whole college thing especially frats and how they work. coming in to UVA i knew/knew-of nobody that goes or went to this school. i’ve met a couple guys from frats and they’ve all asked me to come to their parties/day events which seems great and leaves me wondering some things. are frat guys mandated to go around campus and fish people to come to their parties? and is this in hope to get those people to rush that frat? if you do go to their events and parties is it expected for you to end up rushing that frat. i’m just trying to wrap my head around this whole new world. also is it weird to go to these parties by myself? because i was invited but don’t know anyone else who is. any insight honestly is appreciated this is all crazy to me.

The willingness to provide assistance from the counselors, the tutors, etc.

The professors who are actually FT (some of them even live on campus), and not a collection of adjuncts who also teach at online unis and night schools. Which means that it's not a bunch of professors who are there at 720pm reading off of the slide made by the course director who is too fucking lazy to update the course content that is 10 years out of date, and provides no meaningful assistance as to not ""violate the honor code.""

Students who are actually interested in learning instead of students sharing the previous semesters' completed assignments with each other because they are of the same ethnicity and/or religion.

I hope you all are having a great time settling into UVA! I’ve commented this document here before, but I wanted to put it in its own post so it’s easier to find, especially for undergrads who are interested in getting research experience!!

Some notes:

- it’s a pretty scarily comprehensive document because when it comes to writing I have no self control. So in the first section, I’ve linked a shorter version. Feel free to use that instead!!

- this is mostly geared toward the biological sciences, but hopefully there are stuff that can be useful for other disciplines!

- I update and edit this document from time to time. I won’t be able to do this as often, so I apologize if there are any mistakes that I have missed. 

- there are a few sample/template documents I have linked within this document. One of them is a digital lab notebook template that I hope can be helpful. If you have trouble accessing these, please let me know!

UVA is an R1 university, so there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in research! I hope those of you who do get involved have a wonderful experience! It’ll be tough and discouraging at times because research isn’t easy, but I’ve met so many great friends and mentors along the way! And I hope you will, too!

Best of luck this semester! :)

Also if you can’t access the document here cuz mobile has screwed everything up, just dm me or something, and I’ll share it with you"

* When there's traffic, wait until you have the signal to cross the street. This is especially important on the corner of McCormick and Emmet
* Do not ride scooters or bikes on the sidewalks
* Do not leave Veo scooters on sidewalks, at bike racks, or any place where they impede pedestrians. **Extremely uncool move**. think about folks with strollers and who have mobility issues.
* Don't park your mopeds or motorcycles at bike racks on on sidewalks.
* Do not speed in Charlottesville or through Grounds. The speed limits are 25 and 15 mph for a reason
* Generally, think about what you can do to reduce the amount of driving on grounds and in Charlottesville. There have been a ton of ""where do I park posts"" and the answer should be: YOU DON'T. The last thing we need is more cars and it's just a more pleasant experience without driving. You'll reflect on your years in college living in a walkable community fondly, especially if you happen to get stuck with a one hour daily car commute in your professional life

1. You can register at your Charlottesville address, even if your ID  address is different. As long as you aren't trying to vote in more than one place, you can always register at the address you consider your physical residence.

2. You can complete the registration form online with a valid Virginia DMV-issued ID at the [Citizen Portal](https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation). Please read all questions carefully. If you don't have a VA ID, you'll have to complete the regular form. 

3. If you live at an address with a unit, *make sure you include the unit.* It can hold up the registration if you leave it out. 

4. If you're already registered either in Charlottesville or anywhere in VA, check your registration before completing the form again. The DMV is notorious for switching people in and out of where they have chosen to register, so be especially good about checking if you've just been to the DMV. 

&nbsp;

Feel free to contact the City of Charlottesville at vote@charlottesville.gov or 434-970-3250. Most Central Grounds residents will need Albemarle County, and they can be reached at VoterRegistration@albemarle.org or 434-972-4173.

Some advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1f28ggt/some_advice/,7,5,2024-08-27 04:26:51,"No, I’m not he-who-shall-not-be-named.

For the most part, I’ve enjoyed college, but I’m now a third year without a real friend group and with not a ton of friends in general (beyond meeting people in classes). I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m just not built to be that social of a person, and I’m happy, and I feel right at home academically. But is it a waste to go here just for the degree? Clubs helped a bit but I couldn’t make it to the activities fair and I left my main club that took up most of my social events for other reasons, so they’re not going to be a big part of my life this semester.

Or, even though I’m a naturally introverted person, how can I try to make that friend group? In two years I won’t be able to say that college was the best four years of my life, which is what everyone looks forward to. At this point does it really just come down to trying to get to know people in classes beyond “class friends”? I’m not lost, I just want to make college the absolute best I can, so any help would be appreciated."

I was an hour late to my first class, I was so confused why everyone looked at me. Then class ended like 10 minutes later and then I realized something must be wrong. I redownloaded my schedule from sis and the same thing happened again. Did this happen to anyone else?

Do they enforce permits at JPJ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UVA/comments/1f2hrzs/do_they_enforce_permits_at_jpj/,1,7,2024-08-27 13:59:53,I bought a permit but I think I might have bought the wrong one.
