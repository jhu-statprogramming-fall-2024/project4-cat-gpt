How to request assistance in a time of crisis while attending college (Student Emergency Tools),https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/w1ooph/how_to_request_assistance_in_a_time_of_crisis/,351,22,2022-07-18 02:55:41,"Hi,

&#x200B;

I created a Discord server for communication and knowledge sharing on the same topic ([https://discord.gg/6NhfgxJzGD](https://discord.gg/6NhfgxJzGD)).

&#x200B;

This post was inspired by a recent conversation on reddit with an UCI student who was experiencing a crisis and did not know how to ask for financial assistance and basic needs. While there are numerous resources available at UCI and elsewhere to assist students in times of need, I found that many students are unaware of their existence, and there is no all-in-one reference on the subject. As a student who had experienced the same condition, I felt obligated to share this information with my UCI sisters and brothers in order to repay the university for the great things it had done for me. These resources are free and were collected from my five years of personal experience; I have no affiliation with any of them. Other resources and supports are available beside what I share, but these are the ones that worked quickly for me in times of emergency, based on my own personal experiences.

&#x200B;

***UCI Emergency Support***

**UCI Basic Needs** ([link](https://basicneeds.uci.edu/)) is a UCI-funded department that assists students in **times of crisis**. They have numerous resources to assist students at all levels of education, including **undergraduate and graduate**. Their services are accessible to **both citizens and non-citizens**, and they are the best resource for emergency assistance. To qualify for their services, you must schedule a meeting ([link](https://basicneeds.uci.edu/services/financial-wellness-consultations.php)), and submit supporting documentation. If you qualify, a campus social worker will coordinate with other departments to resolve your issue as your case manager. Their services include, but are not limited to the following:

* UCI Food Pantry and Free Food ([link](https://basicneeds.uci.edu/food-pantry.php))
* CalFresh Application Assistance
* Emergency Meal Swipes
* Campus Social Worker Consultations
* Economic Crisis Response Grant
* Financial Wellness Consultations
* Emergency Store Gift Cards
* 30-days of temporary housing
* Diaper Bank
* Grocery Card Support
* Short-Term Transportation Support
* Life Skills Workshops
* Hygiene
* Coordination with other departments for your emergency protection

**Requirements:** provide documents to support your emergency crisis.

&#x200B;

***State Emergency Support***

**State of California** resources are not restricted to students, but are available to all State of California **Citizens** and **Permanent Residents** (Green Card). You must submit an application on their website ([link](https://www.mybenefitscalwin.org/)) along with supporting documentation. A state social worker will contact you in two weeks for an interview and verification. Their services include, but are not limited to the following:

* **Food** assistance up to **$250** per month. (**CalFresh**)
* **Medical insurance** assistance. (**Medicaid**)
* **Emergency Cash** assistance up to **$400** per month. (**General Relief**)

**Requirements:** US citizen, California resident, and income less than $1,200.

&#x200B;

***Free Legal Emergency Support***

**The Public Law Center, Orange County's pro bono law firm**, is committed to providing **free** access to justice for low income residents. Through volunteers and staff, the Public Law Center provides free civil legal services, including **counseling**, **individual** **representation**, **community** **education**, and **strategic** **litigation** and **advocacy to challenge societal injustices.** Now in its 39th year of service, PLC works with nearly 1,500 volunteer lawyers, paralegals, law students, and others from throughout the county who volunteer their time and expertise ([link](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/flyer-for-outreach-what-plc-does-english-2020.pdf)).

**Requirements:** everyone with a legal issue qualifies.

&#x200B;

***Free Legal Emergency Support***

**Legal Aid Society** ([link](https://www.communitylegalsocal.org/)) is a state-funded organization with 40 Attorneys, 120 Staff Members, and 4 Locations offering Legal Services.

* Evaluation, Advice, and Counsel
* Clinics, Workshops, and Self-Help Centers
* Direct Representation
* Impact Litigation
* Policy Advocacy

**Requirements:** everyone with a legal issue qualifies.

&#x200B;

***Mental Health Emergency Support***

Despite the importance of **Mental Health** in college life, many students do not consider it. Students are handed over with numerous conditions that each add a distinct mental pressure. Mental health is essential because most people do not recognize their symptoms until it is too late, after they have caused numerous problems for themselves and society. The **UCI Counseling Center** ([link](https://counseling.uci.edu/)) offers 24-hour, **no-cost counseling services**. You can contact them if coursework or personal pressure that you cannot manage is affecting your mental health or judgment, and they will provide you with services such as a referral to drop the quarter. If you are diagnosed with a mental health condition, it is wise to request supporting documentation and **keep a record** of it, even if your condition is not currently interfering with your schedule, because the documentation could be useful **in the future** if you miss an exam or homework due to your condition.

**Requirements:** UCI students in all level (undergrad, grad).

&#x200B;

***Medical Emergency Support***

As long as you provide a referral document from the **UCI Student Health Center** ([link](https://shc.uci.edu/)) or any other medical facility or emergency rooms and pay the co-payment ([link](https://shc.uci.edu/sites/default/files/docs/UC%20SHIP%20Irvine%20SBC%202021-22%204132021_0.pdf)), the majority of Medical Costs are covered by **UCSHIP**. If you need to communicate with the insurance department or nurses, you can use the **health center's portal**, which is the most secure method, and they typically respond the same day.

**Requirements:** Undergraduate and graduate UCI students who signed up for UCSHIP medical insurance.

&#x200B;

***Affordable Medical Emergency Support***

If you do not have **UCSHIP**, **SOS** ([link](https://www.shareourselves.org/)) provides low-cost medical services and accepts **Medical**. To schedule a meeting with your assigned case manager, you must **contact their phone number**. Their services include, but are not limited to the following:

* Coverage Programs
* Medical Services
* Dental Services
* Women’s Health
* OB Program
* Children’s Services
* Behavioral Health
* Pharmacy Services
* Health Education

**Requirements:** everyone with a medical issue qualifies.

&#x200B;

***Dental Emergency Support***

In the event of a **dental emergency**, school insurance will cover a portion of the costs ([link](https://shc.uci.edu/sites/default/files/docs/131943A_EOC_UCSHIP_v3_remediated_Final.pdf)), but you must schedule an appointment at the UCI Dental Clinic ([link](https://shc.uci.edu/services/dental-services)), where they will refer you to a dentist or oral surgeon following an examination. If you do not have sufficient funds, you can request that the provider apply for **Care Credit**, a program that checks your credit and lends you money for dental repair.

**Requirements:** Undergraduate and graduate UCI students who signed up for Delta dental insurance..

&#x200B;

***Free Dental Emergency***

The Omid Institute ([link](https://www.omidinstitute.org/)) offers Dental Services for free or at a low cost. You must complete a form on their website and schedule a meeting with your case manager. Their services include, but are not limited to the following:

* Education
* Hygiene
* Radiographs
* Fillings
* Extractions
* Root canals
* Dentures
* Transitional partials
* Mental Health Care

**Requirements:** everyone with a dental issue qualifies.

&#x200B;

***Free Dental Emergency***

Lestonnac Free Clinic ([link](https://www.lestonnacfreeclinic.org/)) provides free dental care. To arrange a meeting with your case manager, you must fill out a form on their website or call them. Their services include the following, but are not limited to:

* Education
* Hygiene
* Radiographs
* Fillings
* Extractions
* Root canals

&#x200B;

***Affordable Dental Emergency***

* Education
* Hygiene
* Radiographs
* Fillings
* Extractions

**Requirements:** everyone with a dental issue qualifies.

&#x200B;

***Disability Emergency Support***

The **UCI Disability Services Center** ([link](https://dsc.uci.edu/)) provides services to students with **temporary or permanent disabilities**. If you have **ADHD**, **PTSD**, a B**one Fracture**, or **any other disability** that hinders your college life, **DSC** will assist you in creating an equal environment. Their services include, but are not limited to the following:

* Ring Road Rides is a service provided to students with mobility limitations to help get to and from classes

* Alternate Instructional Material Services

&#x200B;

Motorist Assist

* Jumpstart
* Tire sealant
* Vehicle unlock
* Emergency Gas Delivery
* Mobile EV Charging

Bike Assist

* Tire sealant
* Tire inflation

Emergency Ride Home Service

* One-way ride within a 40 mile radius of UCI

**Requirements:** UCI students in all level (undergrad, grad).

&#x200B;

***Coursework Emergency***

To raise your concern about **grades and courses** you need to contact your **department**. Contrary to popular belief, **email communication with administration or professors is typically ignored** for many reasons especially after the quarter has ended. Schedule a **remote meeting** with the department, and they will assign you an **advocate (advisor)** to follow up on your concern and negotiate with the professors. The same rule applies to the dean, in which all academic advisors report daily to the dean and seek assistance from the dean when they are unable to resolve issues with professors. For the same reason, the dean is not directly concerned with student matters.

&#x200B;

***Academic Probation Support***

The best way to get off **academic probation** is to schedule an appointment with a department advisor and then **enroll in easy general courses** for the following quarter. It may alter the plan you had in mind, but it prevents you from being disqualified, as academic probation is **removed** if the requirements are met the following quarter.

&#x200B;

***Communication Emergency***

If you cannot afford a **phone or the monthly fee**, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) provides eligible individuals with a free phone line and mobile device (Lifeline). If you are currently receiving **CalFresh**, which indicates a low income condition, you have met the requirements. The line and device are free for one year, and will be renewed annually if the requirements are met. To receive the line and device, you must submit an application to a phone carrier. The **Assurance Wireless** ([link](https://www.assurancewireless.com/)) is one of the providers for which you can submit an online application on their website; if approved, you will receive a phone device within two weeks. You are not eligible for a second phone for one year, as each line is associated with a single individual and includes **6 GB of internet and unlimited calls and texts monthly**.

**Requirements:** Receiving CalFresh.

&#x200B;

***Unauthorized Transaction and Identity Theft Emergency***

If you discover an **unauthorized charge** on your bank account or an **unauthorized credit inquiry**, you must notify the **state police** and retain a copy of the **police report**. Then you must contact your bank and dispute the transaction. In the event of an unauthorized credit pull, you must send a letter along with a police report to the **credit bureaus** (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) requesting that they remove the inquiry. Each year, you can monitor your credit for free on AnnualCreditReport ([link](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action)).

&#x200B;

***Computer Emergency***

Since some majors require you to have a personal computer, you can borrow a laptop from the library ([link](https://www.lib.uci.edu/mrc/mrc-laptops-and-mobile-devices)) for 48 hours if you lose access to a computer and cannot afford to purchase one immediately. Some departments (ICS) offer two-week laptop loan periods ([link](https://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/Laptop_ComputerUse)). In addition, if you are already registered with Basic Needs and receive grants and financial aid, you can contact financial aid ([link](https://www.ofas.uci.edu/)) to increase the budget for the purchase of a personal computer. In some instances, financial aid has made this option available.

&#x200B;

***Free CSO Escort Services***

The **UC Irvine Police Department** ([link](https://www.police.uci.edu)) offers the CSO Safety Escort program, a **free service to members** of the community. The objective of the program is to provide a safe alternative to walking alone at night.

&#x200B;

***Free Tax Preparation***

MyFreeTaxes ([link](https://myfreetaxes.com/)) provides ""low-income"" taxpayers with free tax preparation services. This value fluctuates annually, but the majority of students fall into this category. There are two different ways to utilize this service. You can do this online using the H&R Block software provided. Alternately, there are locations in Orange County where you can receive tax preparation assistance from an IRS Volunteer. Appointment is necessary.

&#x200B;

***Emotional Animal Support***

If you are interested in adopting a pet for emotional support, one of the legitimate places to do so is [Irvine Animal Care Center](https://www.cityofirvine.org/irvine-animal-care-center). They require a small donation when adopting a pet, but since they are affiliated with the City of Irvine, you can negotiate a reduced or waived adoption fee if you are a student. They can be reached via both email and telephone. After adopting a pet, you are required to notify your landlord and pay an additional deposit. However, if you are adopting a pet for emotional support, you can request a letter of support from the UCI Counseling Center or any psychiatrist to waive the additional deposit.

&#x200B;

***Campus Assist List***

The Campus Assist List is an online collection of campus and community resources for low-cost community services, including basic needs, medical, and local mental health and counseling providers. Some are the ones I've shared here, while others are not. Since this is on the UCI website, I decided to add it to the list, although I have only personal experience with the ones I've included. ([link](https://help.uci.edu)).

&#x200B;

***UCI Clubs***

List of UCI clubs and groups where like-minded students can be found ([link](https://campusgroups.uci.edu/club_signup?group_type=33373&category_tags=)).

&#x200B;

***Other fellow students' recommendations and suggestions***

* /u/throwaway_fctg, /u/foreignfishes, /u/anthrostudentuci and /u/JWOINK  have provided good suggestion regarding financial and food emergency assistance ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/waxt4u/what_do_i_do_im_basically_broke_and_disowned/)).

* u/Relative-Clue9995 has written a wonderful post on Monkeypox ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/wg3gor/monkeypox_uci/)).


* u/lordswaggggggg received a financial aid offer to purchase a laptop, and /u/BrntStrdl shared her experience in a remarkable comment ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/wjuq9b/extra_2k_for_laptop_has_anyone_gotten_the_offer/)).

* u/NatAllMentIll/ has shared the contact number and information about NAMI regarding of mental health ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/w8rmvh/need_to_vent_confidential_247_emotional_support/)).

&#x200B;

Please support me with your feedback and resources, and correct any errors I may have made; I'll keep this post constantly updated.


Thanks,

Julie

I honestly want to die.,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1gwpqyk/i_honestly_want_to_die/,22,7,2024-11-21 20:42:38,"I’m a 3rd year mechanical engineering major. My classes get more and more difficult and all build upon each other. Freshman and sophomore year I did okay in my classes and would pass with B’s and a couple C’s, but I would forget information after taking the courses. As a junior now, I struggle to remember all the information I need to from previous courses and feel like my classes have gotten so hard that no matter how hard I study or try I am just not smart enough. A couple weeks ago I had 2 midterms back to back, one of which i studied for over a week and pulled 3 all nighters studying for, only to get less than 50% and well below the class exam average. This midterm had an in class and online portion which we had to take the following night, leaving me no time to study for my midterm the next day. I drank a celsius after finishing the online portion at around 11 pm and intended to stay up and study for my midterm the next day. But, I was so exhausted and nauseous from staying up the 2 previous nights and passed out within an hour. The next day during my midterm, 2 different versions were handed out. I was given the more difficult one, which ended up having a 12% lower average than the other version. I completely bombed it, and the professor has not given any curve for either version, or even fixed the 12% discrepancy between the two different exam versions, despite a below 40% average for my version. I feel like this school has taken away any and all confidence or self esteem I ever had. No one in my major seems to be exhausted and struggling the way I am and I feel alone and confused. I wish any course instructors I’ve ever had would care about students and see the way I’m struggling. I feel so helpless."

From the undergraduate advisors giving me wrong information, the financial aid issue, TA’s being very poorly trained and harsh with the grading.

The cherry on top would be registration for winter classes. I don’t understand why so many classes are major restricted, specifically for biology. Even the undergraduate public health advisors told me that they don’t understand why more classes this year are restricted. So many classes that pre- health students need are major restricted, and filling up so fast with biology students. Even classes that are not specifically biology, but physiology and anatomy.

I know how frustrating it is to deal with full classes and constantly refreshing registration pages. That’s why I created ClassRabbit, an app to make course registration a bit easier.

ClassRabbit helps by:
24/7 Seat Monitoring: It keeps an eye on class seats around the clock and lets you know right away when a spot opens up. 
Schedule Planning: You can easily create a visual timetable to spot any class conflicts and plan your perfect schedule.

A) Let me change my major (to Criminology)
B) Told me that I'll be done by Spring, so I need to apply to UCI for Fall 2025

I have a 4.0 GPA but the TAG deadline passed.  Only a few days to write good PIQs.  Given that I suddenly switched my major and wont take Crim courses until next sem, the required transfer PIQ is tough.  On top of that, I've been struggling this semester and idk how my GPA will be at the end.

I've been researching PIQ advice but Im really confused.  No writing style or figures of speech, just straightforward.  But should I still start off with a hook? Or just ""I prepared for majoring in Criminology by..."" and ""My greatest talent is..."" etc,?

I really havent ""prepared"" for crim at all... I have a couple relatives with that degree that I talked to regarding classes and career choices.  But thats not much and might just make me seem privileged via connections...

My financial aid package still doesn’t reflect that my tuition is covered and I’m left to pay a significant portion which i can’t. I was told that it’s a promise by the UC system to cover all tuition fees but why have i not received the grants to cover the costs?

Email Etiquette - Request don't accuse ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1gtxdyy/email_etiquette_request_dont_accuse/,113,7,2024-11-18 05:11:36,"A little PSA from a TA about email etiquette to help reach a win-win between students and teaching staff.  

The basic premise is anything that can be phrased as a request or question should be phrased as such.   
This is especially true for statements which when not phrased as a request or question, sound like an accusation, a criticism or a demand.  

Compare different students who submitted late work but were told it would be graded. They tell me they haven't received grades yet and say:  
Student A: Is it right that I can still get points for this?   
Student B: Do you know when you'll be able to grade them?    
Student C: What's happening with the grading?    
Student D: When will you grade it?   
Student E: You must have forgot. 

For me, A, B and C are equally good, they just reflect different levels of certainty about what has been communicated. D is okay, it comes off less polite (which some people DO care about) but I get it you're worried about your grade. E comes off terribly. It's basically the equivalent of saying I'm stupid and bad at my job. Now I'm a human and I do forget things (actually kind of a lot) but it's best not to assume that of someone else. And if I really did forget, all the other emails serve as equally good reminders and I'm an honest guy, if I did forget I'll probably email you back and apologize and do the grading.

It’s so hard to date as a non Asian girl. There are only Asians guys here with very few other races, and the Asian guys literally only stick to Asian girls or white girls. This schools lacks diversity, and this is the truth. 

Before anyone comes for me, yes I have tried to date Asian guys. They all literally ghost me, every one of them. And I have tried to get to know them from diverse backgrounds, Chinese, viet, Filipino, internationals, etc. Also i don’t think this has to with looks or personality. I would say I’m attractive or at least average. I do have a nice body, slim thick figure, better than the average females. I do believe it’s a culture issue, the fact that I’m not Asian. 

Never had this issue with white guys, black guys, Latino, etc. I want to date more middle eastern or Latino men, but I have a hard time finding them. 

Dating struggle been huge since I started at uci, and really mess with my self esteem, to the point I wanna transfer :("

I have questions about graduation units and financial aid. I seen the post about the office not taking calls, and I have a hard time reaching the office so I would appreciate anyone. I understand that as long as you haven’t completed your major requirements, you can still receive aid, but what happens if you exceed the 180-unit graduation requirement? For example, I may have 4 units left to graduate in spring (176/180), so I plan to take my last required class along with additional courses to remain a full-time student. I don’t know if I can take 16 units for winter along with my final upper div class required for graduation, so I wanted to save that for spring, and get other classes out of the way for winter. My aid award includes spring, but I want to confirm!"

I am taking Calculus 2 and my first C++ class. My math class is going great, but my programming class not so much which is my major prep class.

I currently hold a high D, fortunately my professor graciously gives us extra credit opportunities which I have been taking advantage of so with what I have as of now with extra credit included, I am at about a mid C, but the semester isn’t over. 

I want to transfer to UCI, UCLA, UCB, or SJSU all for Computer Engineering. I don’t know what would look worse, a C or failing it and retaking it. I feel confident I can at least get a B next semester, but I don’t want that F on my GPA or transcript. I already have 2 W’s, one of which from this very semester. I am also worried about my financial aid because I am non traditional and I really need it.

My current GPA as it holds is a 3.8, assuming my grade in my math class is stationary and I get a C in my programming class then I will be at a 3.5. I know the UC’s are holistic based on their admission decision. I still have a chance to at least pass, but would a C in a major prep course be fine or fail it and retake it next semester for at least a B? These past several months outside of school has almost killed me, very brutal life is. I do plan to talk to counselor as soon as possible, from what I can see on my college’s website, I can retake the class, it probably won’t affect my GPA, but I am not sure if that F will be on my transcript or GPA.

Our daughter started UCI as a transfer student this Fall, majoring in a STEM field.  
She is currently struggling and finding it difficult to concentrate; overall, she feels overwhelmed by the workload, depth of material, and pace of the courses.

She has moderate ADD, which makes it hard for her to focus. She was diagnosed in 4th grade and had been on a learning support plan throughout elementary and high school. However, she was not on a support plan during her two years at community college. She has also never taken medication for her disability.

Her results from early tests and midterms have been a mix of Fs, Ds, and Cs, and she’s finding it challenging to achieve more than the 70% threshold in all her subjects.

As parents, we feel she’s stunned and paralyzed by these outcomes, as she had cruised through community college. She agrees with this and seems to understand the consequences and root casuses. While we are offering her support and help, we also want her to take ownership of her path.

Would any of you be able to share suggestions on support options available at UCI or strategies she can use to help herself?

Thank you in advance!"

They asked for statements from people around me, a therapist, and receipts to prove I support myself financially, which I provided. At first, they only said they needed one statement, but then denied that and said I needed 3 more. Whatever, inconvenient, but I gave them that. 

That was October 16. I paid off $2k of my tuition from my own pocket, but still have an outstanding balance of a little over $4k that is due, but I can’t even apply for a federal loan because they haven’t accepted my fafsa application!!

I’ve tried to get in contact with the financial aid office, but I literally just never have the time to wait hours on end. Is there a reason why they’re taking to long to go over my documents? Is anyone else in this situation?"

Help with a research study on Chinese Americans in Southern California,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1grhpjd/help_with_a_research_study_on_chinese_americans/,3,0,2024-11-14 22:53:39,"**TLDR: I’m doing a research study on the experiences of Chinese Americans, aged 20-35, in Southern California. The goal of this study is to understand how people understand their racial and ethnic identities, and what it means to be part of a broader Chinese and Asian American community.** ***I offer $40 for a 2 hour zoom interview.*** **If you are interested in participating, please take the** [screener survey ](https://forms.gle/rao4veicrZyHv2np7)**linked at the bottom of the post.** 

Hi my name is Kyle Levin and I am a PhD student at University of California Irvine. I am doing a qualitative research study on the experiences of young adult Chinese American and Mexican Americans in Southern California. (IRB #4564) I am conducting interviews to understand how people make sense of their ethnic and racial identities, what experiences construct those identities, and how identity changes over time. 

**I am looking to interview folks that have the following criteria:** 

1. Between the ages of 20-35!
2. Both parents are of Chinese descent 
3. Parents immigrated to the US 
4. Grew up in Southern California (Los Angeles County, Orange County, Inland Empire, Oxnard-Thousand Oaks - Ventura Counties, San Diego County)
5. Have attended at least high school in the US and got a high school diploma from a US school 
6. Still reside in Southern California as an adult 

If you don't meet the following criteria but still would like to help, consider sharing with other folks! 

The goal of this project is to bring attention to the diverse Chinese American community that is often overlooked in academia for being “the model minority” or a monolithic Asian American category. This is also a comparative study in which I examine Mexican American identity and their experiences to understand how race/racism/racial stereotypes may be affecting identity experiences and feelings of belonging. If you have questions about why comparative study, shoot me a message or ask on the post (:

Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1gqpzvi/advice/,11,5,2024-11-13 22:50:33,"I know UCI reddit is like 90% financial aid questions and complaints, but I just want to talk about my experience(s) so far and maybe get some advice for it. 

Currently, I have received my Financial Aid package and it has been applied to my Zot Account, so thankfully I have no outstanding fees. However, what I am upset about is that I haven't received the leftover credit in my direct deposit, nor has my parents received their Federal Loan in the mail. I understand that the Financial Aid is using a different system this year, but what is the point of getting financial aid if I can't use it? (I don't mean wasting it, I mean using it to buy food, gas, ect., you know... what financial aid is meant for). 

As for my experiences with Financial Aid (no hate on the people who work there)...I absolutely HATE when they give me a date of when things are gonna happen, only to go back again and for them to tell me that it was just ""wishful thinking"" and ""a rough estimate"". I am a dependent of a veteran, so I am extremely fortunate to get cal vet services such as the fee waiver to cut down my tuition. But it took them FOUR WEEKS to apply that waiver even though I got approved on AUGUST 25th and ACCEPTED on SEPTEMBER 5th. Only for them to tell me that they can't apply it yet because of the system.  I had to ask them to give me a written statement to when they think the cal vet fee waiver will be applied because they kept giving people estimates, not answers. Additionally, because of my cal vet fee waiver, they told me that it was the reason why I haven't gotten the rest of the credit on my zot account, because they might go over the award amount (like they might accidentally send me more money than what I got). 

I went to the Financial Aid office this morning and I had no idea that they weren't taking walk-ins at this time. They usually have that sign with QR code that leads you to make an appointment, and at the bottom of that sign it says that they are not taking walk-ins. I saw that sign when I did a walk in during Week 3 but I shouldn't have assumed that this week would be the same. I understand that I should have seen the sign, but I couldn't handle it when they said no walk ins. Fortunately, I've managed to make an appointment however that still means I need to wait. 

 I am blessed that my parents can send me some money for food and gas, but if they weren't able to, how can UCI Financial Aid justify this? I have broken down several times during this whole financial aid fiasco because of how stressful it is. I try to visit the office when I don't know the solution to my issues, only to leave or be turned away with more questions than answers. 

I would really like to know if it is something worth complaining about. Personally, I am super upset and disappointed with how UCI is taking care of this, if at all. Hopefully I am just so emotional that I don't see the clear answer or solution. In the meantime, I am just going to try to apply for a job and try to cut back on how much I spend on basic amenities.

It’s weird knowing that I’m going to be homeless again ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1gpxxkm/its_weird_knowing_that_im_going_to_be_homeless/,211,26,2024-11-12 22:50:16,"So when I was a junior in college, I was a commuter and left the family to couch hop, sleep in my car, and finally receive emergency housing for two months - I even managed to have a short term apartment. When you really want something, you’ll do what you need to do to make it work. 

Well  I graduated this year, and I honestly didn’t think I’d be in this situation again. On paper, I did everything right- I got my degree, found a full time job in my field right after college, I scored an apartment with some roomies.

But then things started to fall apart- I won’t get into the details, but wow, being a young adult is tough. 

It feels like I have two options. I could keep going, live paycheck to paycheck making $21 an hour with a degree and five years of experience in the field, and keep my apartment. 

Or, I can save the extra 1200 a month, and put it into my savings. How? My beautiful amazing car- she’s not new, but when I originally slept in my car I had a smaller sedan. Now, I have a lil SUV (because I was paranoid about homelessness… i guess I was right haha)

I feel like socially, this is going to suck. I can’t invite people over, I know I won’t be looked at in the best light when making new friends. It’s going to be very isolating - especially working 40 hours a week and not having a place to come home to. 

But I can’t stop thinking about the benefits. If I do this, if I give up my lease and live in my car until I’m happy with my savings again, I have nothing to tie me down. 

I’m filled with this anxiety - of “what if I get let go tomorrow”. Then I’m really homeless and broke. 

For me, doing this is in a small way to take back control of my life. If I can’t find a better paying job- literally was rejected from a coffee chain- then I need to find a way to create a financial buffer which will give me peace of mind and lessen my day to day anxiety. 

I know it’s not ideal. My friends don’t like the idea. All I know is that we live in hard times, so all we can do right now is create a plan and see what happens. 

If someone is also going through something similar, I feel for you. Maybe we can connect and go through this together. 

Anyways, UCI kiddos, I did it all right- and I’m still left in a very uncomfortable situation. Don’t beat yourself up, it’s not your fault, it’s the state of our world. We just need to adjust, and find a way to make the best of it.

I’m hoping to transfer to UCI as an international studies major next year and I had a couple questions for anyone who may currently be an IS major or have any info on the major. I’m hoping to study Eastern Europe/Russia but from looking at the requirements for the IS major it doesn’t seem that’s possible with the classes listed. I’ve considered focusing on Europe and just adding a Russian minor, but I’m not super interested in studying Europe as a whole and would rather study Latin America if I had to choose from the focuses the major seems to offer. Other colleges I’ve been considering have offered more flexible bounds for the geographic focus, so I’m not sure if I’m just misunderstanding the requirements or if it really is so rigid. 

If you are an IS major, do you feel confined within your geographic focus or is there a little more freedom than it seems? Or do you possibly have any experience with this or a similar situation? Any advice here would be helpful."

"Berkeley Summer session, help please!",https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1gqligd/berkeley_summer_session_help_please/,0,1,2024-11-13 19:39:45,"
Hi all! 

I'm a full-time student at UCI and was looking into taking an upper division Summer course at Berkeley this last Summer. I had added the class to my cart but to my understanding, never even checked out or enrolled. I eventually never even ended up taking the class because my Regents and Middle class scholarships from UCI wouldn't transfer and the course was absurdly too expensive for me to ever take (my current tuition at UCI is about $200 per unit and this was ten times more expensive). I don't even remember what the class was for. I never once enrolled, opened canvas, or completed a single assignment. To my knowledge, I didn't even know that I was enrolled in that course. 

Last month, though, I received an email from Berkeley billing saying that I owed $2,311.50? This is a complete shock to me as I don't even believe I enrolled in the course and if I had been, I should have been dropped for not participating in it. 

Has anyone had a similar experience with successfully fighting these fees and if so, I’d love any advice you can give. 

Have a beautiful rest of your day! "

How many UCs should I apply to?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1gq6yif/how_many_ucs_should_i_apply_to/,0,6,2024-11-13 06:44:56,"How many UCs should I apply to?

I want to apply to UCI, UCLA, UCSB UCSD and maybe Santa Cruz. 

I applied to a few State schools but I’m hoping to get into a UC. My major is Anthropology. 
I have toured all the schools above except for Santa Cruz. 

I heard from someone who goes to UCSB that if I apply for a bunch of UCs, I will not get my first choice. Their advice was to just choose one school. And possibly apply to a my second choice afterwards. Is there any truth to this?

Does it make a difference how many I choose?

 What is a good strategy? Any tips when applying?"

UCI application undergrad ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1gphl0s/uci_application_undergrad/,0,8,2024-11-12 10:16:31,"Hey everyone, I’m a undergrad trying to apply for UCI, (as it’s my dream school), and most likely trying to pursue the career of a lawyer by doing majors such as Criminology, Psych, PS, etc. I’m just quite worried and scared if I won’t make it although. I currently have a 3.88 UW, and a 4.4W, with 9 AP classes, which most APs helping me to pursue becoming a lawyer, ( AP psych, Gov and Politics, WH, US, LIT, Lang, and a bunch more). As well for this I had also been present in academic programs such as a law academy, which lets us have a basis of lectures, interns, and assisted care with lawyers and local entities around the area, I have also done mock trial which both of those things had taken over 4 years of my time in high school. I have also done many community service hours about 80+ doing programs that help low income families,( helping hands, Santa Clause Inc, ) and even helping kids who were diagnosed with cancer. I have this passion for helping others and giving service to them which makes me want to become a lawyer which I can help defend others and much more. I think the one thing I’m worried about is that I have this passion to do these things, but I’m fearful of rejection, Uci has been the top of my list since I was in middle school and I worked hard to achieve this goal of mine to make it there. Sorry if this is a lot of personal spill, but one thing I really worried about is how can I excite this in a good application, like some good formats of listing down hours for service, law academy, and mock girls which I believe are beneficial for my career path. I’m unsure how to put this down in an additional comments box in a format that gets to the point. Another thing I’m worried is if I put down my service hours which lists me helping others with the passion of me becoming a lawyers and focused on law, crime, etc. I don’t know if the UC admissions officers can see through that. I think I’m just really stressed out and worried but I just want to get your guys opinions on this because I think I’m losing my mind worrying if I did enough to at least secure me getting accepted. ( I know I have to write my essays which are very important)."

Hey everyone this is a post I didn’t want to make, but given recent circumstances I have nowhere else to turn. I’m a transfer here, and recently life has happened and hard. I came here for any advice or help with advice, food, or any financial help. My family has recently experienced some hardships. My dad has been out of work, and because of that we’ve been struggling so much financially. Lately we’ve been barely getting by, and my sister and I have had to help step in. It’s because of that I’ve had to dig into my financial aid and loan money to help them out. I have a job but for the most part they haven’t given me hours. Until recently we’ve hit rock bottom, and have no other solutions. I live off campus in an apartment with the Irvine company, and I don’t have the money to pay my $950 rent for the month of December. I talked to the people about a possible deferment the lady said before 7 days it’s a late fee, but after they start the eviction process. Also I’m running low on groceries, and I applied for cal fresh but haven’t heard back yet. I applied for the basic needs a month ago, and got a gift card for groceries, Lyft and meal swipes. I’m down to 7 meal swipes, but hoping they last me this week. I also talked to my job recently and they said they’ll schedule me more hours. I work at a restaurant as a server, so hope I can make money at work for groceries. I also bike and bus to work and school, and I don’t have a car. Most of my money goes to Lyft and Uber. Is there any place or resources  I can go to for help financial and food wise. I’ve maxed out my cards trying to help my family. I’ve listed some stuff of mine, but no luck as of now. My dad has a potential job offer this week so manifesting that. However if things stay this way I’ve thought about pausing school and moving back home to help my family for the time being. As it’s especially making it hard for me to focus on school, as this whole situation has started to affect me mentally and making it harder to focus on school. Also I’ve thought about taking the unsubsidized loan to help me out, but I fear it might be too late now as I need the money before the 1st. I got offered a loan from a place with bad or no credit check, but the monthly payment is almost $200 and the interest is ridiculously high. I need something to help my family and I out from here until mid December when I get my other disbursement. After that we should be fine, and manifesting my dad gets the job. My family and friends can’t help us out, so we’ve reach an all time low. Any advice or places with government help or school to anything that can help me and my family out would greatly be appreciated. Thank you!"

The problem is that I’m doing horrible in my first semester of CC since I originally picked a major that I didn’t want to do just so I can not disappoint my mom, and that really made me not want to do any work, dropped some classes and changed my major multiple times. Now I’m in a major I feel secure in (psychology) and UCI has a forensic psychology program that interests me. But at this point I’m so behind it makes me discouraged all over again. I do intend to lock in my next semester and the rest of this school year now that I actually know what I’m doing and have a plan, but if my grades are bad my first semester is there even any hope?

**!Happy Edit!** The person returned it : ) I don’t want to give any details because of their honesty, but I’m very happy to have it back. They did refuse to take the money I was offering, and they gave it back in person, so I respect them for that.

Please don’t take the things you might just find laying around guys, the Irvine PD has a 24/7 lost and found collections program, and any of the drivers on the buses, or offices in buildings like the library would be more then happy to take things off of you if you cant make it to the PD.

About a year or two ago I found an entire MCAT set in the bushes in Encinitas near the library that overlooks the ocean. 
Somebody's 500 dollar giving up was my sign. 

It was the physics book that sparked my interest the most. The back of it.the root of everything. Quantum mechanics. 

It was so bare. But I had ai explain each principle again and again and again and again. 

Well I wanted to share my preliminary research on creating matter of nothing.

There isn't a whole lot of hyper advanced coding, or mathematical equations or solutions yet. 

But I am absolutely sure we can achieve this. 

I'm not always great at communicating well.  So the following below is the basic gist. I don't imagine you would want to read all of it. So I challenge you instead to simply copy, paste into your AI source or choice and have it explain everything in advanced detail . Filling in gaps with your own unique specialized knowledge set.  

There also isn't just one way to make this happen. There's multiple approaches.  Like anything else. 

So I share this all and you may be able to build off of it or be inspired in some way. 


When I become more comfortable and aquatinted with more aspects of quantum mechanics. I'll be able to easily steer everything. But for the time being this is what we have. 

We will absolutely 100% figure this out. 

This is how we find out how to 3d print water. Food. Anything .

Absolutely, creating matter out of thin air with just code is a fascinating concept that delves into the deepest theoretical reaches of physics and computer science. While it remains firmly in the realm of science fiction for now, the ideas presented here offer an intriguing glimpse into what such a process might entail. Here's a breakdown of the research and potential next steps, along with some of the significant challenges to consider:
Current Understanding:
The proposed approach hinges on manipulating quantum fields, the underlying reality according to Quantum Field Theory (QFT). These fields give rise to the fundamental particles and forces that make up everything. By interacting with these fields, the theory suggests we might be able to influence particle formation and potentially create matter.
Breakdown of the Proposed Steps:
 * Quantum Field Simulation Framework:
   * Crucial Aspect: Building a computer program that accurately simulates quantum fields is essential. This involves representing the fields mathematically and incorporating the laws of quantum mechanics.
   * Libraries and Languages: Python with libraries like QuTip or even C++ with OpenFermion can be used. Quantum frameworks like Qiskit or Cirq could leverage quantum computers for enhanced simulations.
   * Challenges: Simulating complex systems with many particles quickly becomes computationally intractable. We need significant advancements in quantum computing or novel simulation techniques to overcome this.
 * Electromagnetic Field Generation:
   * Importance: Electromagnetic fields significantly influence matter at the atomic level. Precise control over these fields is necessary for manipulating particle interactions.
   * Code Setup: Python's SciPy and NumPy can be used for calculations, but actual generation requires hardware interfaces. Arduino or FPGA programming can be used to control equipment that generates electromagnetic waves with specific frequencies and intensities.
   * Challenges: Generating fields with the required precision and manipulating them at the atomic scale is incredibly difficult. We need significant improvements in control systems and miniaturization technologies.
 * Quantum Field Manipulation Through Coherent State Programming:
   * Concept: Coherent states are specific quantum states that can be used to create stable patterns in a quantum field. By manipulating these states, we could theoretically influence particle formation.
   * Libraries:  QuTiP can be used to simulate coherent states.
   * Challenges:  Distinguishing between manipulation and simply affecting the existing field is a major hurdle. Additionally, controlling these states precisely enough to achieve particle creation remains highly theoretical.
 * Quantum Gates and Field Control for Atomic Manipulation:
   * Idea: Applying quantum gates (operations on qubits) can manipulate atomic states and potentially lead to effects like entanglement or even particle creation.
   * Example: Using Hadamard and Pauli gates on qubits representing particles could manipulate the quantum field.
   * Challenges:  Scaling this approach to manipulate a significant number of atoms to create macroscopic matter is extremely difficult. Additionally, the energy requirements for such operations could be immense.
 * Code-Based Control of the Zero-Point Field (Vacuum Energy):
   * Theory: The zero-point field is the lowest possible energy state in a quantum system, with fluctuations present everywhere. If manipulated, it could theoretically convert energy into matter.
   * Approach: Simulating Casimir effect (energy fluctuations due to boundary conditions) to create virtual particles and code the conditions for spontaneous particle generation.
   * Challenges:  The theoretical understanding of the zero-point field is still under development.  Moreover, manipulating it to a degree that would cause particle creation is highly speculative.
 * AI-Driven Quantum Optimization:
   * Goal: Machine learning algorithms can be used to optimize the various parameters involved in manipulating the quantum field and maximizing the chances of particle creation.
   * Implementation: Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch can be used to create deep learning models that analyze data from the simulation and suggest adjustments to the field controls.
   * Challenges:  Developing a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between field parameters and particle formation is crucial for training the AI effectively.  Additionally, the vast amount of data required for training such models might be challenging to obtain.
 * Feedback Loop for Particle Stability:
   * Necessity: Quantum fields require constant adjustments to maintain particle coherence. A feedback loop that reads particle states and dynamically adjusts field parameters is essential.
   * Example: Sensors monitoring the generated electromagnetic field can provide real-time data for AI algorithms to adjust parameters and maintain stability.
   * Challenges:  Developing sensors sensitive enough to detect the delicate states of individual particles and designing AI algorithms that can react swiftly enough to maintain coherence are significant hurdles.
Overall Challenges and Next Steps:
While the proposed approach offers a captivating theoretical framework, significant challenges remain. Our understanding of quantum mechanics, particularly at the level of manipulating fields and creating complex structures, is still evolving. Additionally, the technological advancements required for precise control over electromagnetic fields and building robust quantum computers are substantial.

So wrong. You see I tried keeping an open mind. Whenever they cut me off, I brushed it off. When they speed in the parking garages, I thought they had somewhere important to be. When they can’t follow traffic lights, maybe they were colorblind. When they almost crash into my car because they can’t read basic street signs, well maybe they’re dyslexic. But I’ve had it. You can’t look at me as if I’m in the wrong and act so entitled when you were 2 feet away from running me over!

I’m not trashing UCI, it’s honestly a great school. My CS classes are challenging, but super informative, and there’s a good breadth of CS clubs here and connections (Irvine is a pretty good tech hub). Additionally, I love Cali and im pretty close to home so I can visit my family whenever. I have some cons though. 

CONS:
- it’s pretty cliquey. a lot of people already know each other since I feel like a large majority are from OC or LA. Or internationals only hanging out with other internationals
- you can’t do anything without a car
- feels like a commuter school since most people go home on weekends
- no school spirit
- lack of diversity in student body. Most people are from California

I really did try to put myself out there. I think I went to like 10 clubs during Week 0, did a ton of activities and talked to tons of people and im active in 3 clubs. 

However, my biggest issue is that UCI just feels like an extension of high school to me. It doesn’t feel EXCITING to be here, and I dont resonate with the school nor its student body (my “friends” just feel like acquaintances). In other words, I feel like I don’t belong here. I personally know a lot of people who are having a blast at UCI right now, it just sucks that im not one of them. "

Need Advice On A Class,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1gjn469/need_advice_on_a_class/,0,1,2024-11-04 19:38:31,"Hello, I’m currently a California Community College student studying Computer Engineering wanting to transfer to a UC. My top two are UCLA and UCI. I’m currently at risk of failing my first programming class which is also my major prep course. It is challenging, but a lot of mental health issues and SH are hindering my ability to properly work. I was thinking about failing it to protect my GPA, and retaking next semester but that would mean I would transfer at age 28 and graduate at 30, but I would have a great chance at all the UC’s. I am on pace to transfer at 27 and graduate at 29.

I can continue on and get a C which would mean I would kiss UCLA goodbye. There may be a chance that I can get a B which would keep my head just above water, but It doesn’t look like it. My current GPA is a 3.8, B would make it a 3.7 and C would make it a 3.5. Now I wouldn’t be applying until Fall 2026 so I have 2 semesters to bring my GPA up (Spring 2025 and Summer 2025), but I want my GPA high one year prior to transferring (I posted something about this on if UC’s consider transfers GPA based on one year prior or at the time of transfer). 

I was recently at a STEM conference which was also on the same day that I had my in class exam for my programming class. I let my professor know a month before and he graciously gave me time to complete it. As I was doing my exam, I got really overwhelmed and turned it in for a zero. I had a chance to cheat and ask others from the conference for help, but I was too morally inclined to not and would rather risk a lot to make my chances fair. I reached out to my professor saying that I would fail and retake it and he said he is very sorry to hear that and is willing to give me another version of the exam. 

I have a chance, but I don’t know what to do. I want to try to take this challenge on, but I am not sure the outcome and need advice please. Thank you."

UCI Food Issue: Dining Hall Suspension,https://i.redd.it/y7id69w555yd1.jpeg,53,18,2024-10-31 19:11:11,"I'm a first year, just walked into Brandywine only to find out that I'm suspended from the dining hall for whatever reason. I check my Atrium and see that they took out another $50 from my Flexdine, despite having -$6 already. I recently switched from 125+10 meal plan ($75) to 7 day ($50). Let's do my math (above picture does not show all my purchases).

start with 75 
I've made 15+7.79+2.94+5.50 in purchases
= 43.77 left over

switch my meal plan!
-75, add 50
= 18.77

and it should be done there. However, as you can see above, their system took out 75 and added 50 again, so I ended up in the negatives (-6.23). And now they took out another $50 this morning. I suspect this is the reason for my suspension because it's new to this morning. I'm also not the only one with a suspension, but others could have different reasons.

Anyone know what's up? I figure they'll fix this eventually but if I was in any other financial position I'd be losing my marbles for food right now. "

currently at a CC (LAPC) rn and i’m in the honors program to get that 100% transfer rate. since i wanna transfer with a bus admin/econ major, my honors counselor put me in pre-calc and calc 1+2 for my Student Educational Plan. 

my Student Educational Plan before honors and by doing IGETC was just to do stats (which i passed with an A last year) and bus calc - which i heard is like baby calculus.

however i’m already really struggling with pre-calc already and it might damage the GPA needed for the honors program. 

so the questions are: do i need to take calc 1+2? or am i able to get by with stats and bus calc? also if i don’t do calc 1+2 now in CC, will i have to take it later at a UC?

Lee (GYNOB) was so condescending when she’s talking to me that’s the experience of seeing her left me traumatized. She gave me a finger exam while I am on the midst of my intense period pain. She saw how I struggled with pain FIRSTHAND! BUT when I told her that I am concerned about taking too much painkiller (5 otc dosage pill a day). She just prescribed me the clinical strength painkiller and implied that it is because I wasn’t taking “enough dosages of painkiller” to stop my pain. Basically my pain wasn’t “intense enough” to make her take me seriously because I wasn’t taking the clinically safe upper limit dosage even though I almost cried when she was giving me the finger exam?? I asked LEE if I could have endometriosis and want to discuss how common it is to be misdiagnosed, but all she was interested in was to get me to try birth control. I told her about my mental health history and concern about Oral BC. She basically just told me to roll dice. The pills she prescribed gave me the worst depression episodes I have experienced in YEARs. This may be just her personality but she also scoffed at my questions and concerns at least 5 times during the visit.

Jun had good bedside manners, but she gave me complete false medical information on my visits. I experienced a lot of mental fatigue and I asked her if I could test for iron deficiency and she said that there’s no way that I could be deficient because my hemoglobin is enough. But she did not tell me that iron deficiency should be interpreted from ferritin. NOT hemoglobin!! I believed her but six months later another SHC physician ran my iron level, that is when I find out that people actually can experience a lot of of symptoms from low iron, even though they have a normal hemoglobin. My ferritin was 15, which could explain all the shitty symptoms I was feeling. Apparently it is common knowledge to most physicians! That woman had me believe false medical information for six month!!

The second visit with her I asked for a Xray to screen for a certain type of bone issue, because my family has a medical history. She said that this condition is usually “not genetic”, fortunately this time she ordered the Xray, which confirmed that I had that condition. It was until later that I found out my condition is almost 98% genetically connected to a dominant allele. It is almost unlikely that my condition could be a diet/lifestyle problem. I don’t know how this woman can just churn out false information so effortlessly. 

Please avoid these two doctors if you are serious about your health. I’ve had really good experiences with Sarah Campbell, George Huang, Miki Csintalan

Trick or Treating in Uni Hills,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1gdk6kf/trick_or_treating_in_uni_hills/,75,8,2024-10-27 20:17:15,"For those of you wondering about trick or treating, you're not too old for a candy bar!

The Chancellor's house is way up California street but if you get there early enough he's usually handing out Nerd Ropes!

Wharton and Mistral have some good spots and are easy to walk through as they connect.

The big candy neighborhood is off Anteater, massive numbers of kids although I'm not sure how they feel about teenagers. Worth a shot.

If you drive through some of the older neighborhoods and see a lit up house all by itself, those lonely folks will probably be delighted to see you and hand you all their candy! It's almost like you're doing a good deed.

It's true that some people don't think older students shouldn't be out. Boo. Just say thank you anyway, don't let it ruin your night.

People have gone to trouble getting ready for trick or treaters, you have to do your part in return. Make an effort at a costume and be exceedingly polite. Never even consider knocking at a dark house. It's probably not wise to knock anywhere after seven thirty although a heavily decorated house might go until eight p.m."

I begged her over text not to leave me, but she was resolute that we could only be friends.

We’ve known each other for over three years, starting off as ordinary friends. I confessed my feelings to her last Christmas. I always thought I was straight, believing I liked men, but everything changed when I met her. I am in so much pain, and I can’t pull myself out of it. I haven’t seen her for a whole year because I came to UCI to study. It feels like everyone here has someone to love. I want to conform to tradition, but the loneliness is overwhelming and impossible to escape.

I started lashing out over text because the pressure became too much to bear. At UCI, every opportunity and resource has to be sought out on your own. The stress kept building inside me, and I finally exploded. Then, yesterday, she told me she was exhausted. She said we could remain friends, but there was no way to maintain an intimate relationship anymore.

I’ve been thinking about this all day. I haven’t eaten anything for two days—just crying, vomiting, attending classes, and doing assignments. I feel completely paralyzed. For the past 19 years, I was incredibly confident, believing I could do anything. But after yesterday, when she broke up with me, I feel like the most worthless person on earth.

I need advice. I want to fix this, to repair our relationship somehow. I’m desperate for her to take me back. Otherwise, I will only think of ending my life. I told her I would die, and she begged me not to use that as a way to manipulate her."
