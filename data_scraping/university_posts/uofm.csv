Please let me know if you see anything that needs to be updated or any new information that can be posted/linked to.

* [Housing Survival Guide](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1A0eZ4UH8XNkFl4yW0yFImyyzAEw5qp-o) by u/fluffymoomin - PDF guide. Essential to avoid being scammed.


**Listings:**

* [Area Facebook Housing Groups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q1JGSRwOZ6BPzsi-fjiSrZwPiKmmGcrKrLmVX1UnUC4/edit#gid=0) - Facebook group list compiled by u/fluffymoomin - Groups are listed with descriptions as well as safety recommendations. Not all groups are moderated well, be careful regardless of the group, moderators are human. Do not pay money to post in any facebook group. It's a scam. The ones that ask for money are no different, or worse than the free ones. Any reply asking you to message or dm them is likely a scam.

* [UofM offical off-campus housing site](https://offcampushousing.umich.edu/) - You can now sort by recently updated listings. You can post listings or as a person looking for housing/roomates.

* [Ann Arbor off-campus housing](https://www.annarboroffcampus.com/) - This was the site that uofm used as their official site until it was replaced with the site above. One of the biggest gripes I had with this version is that commercial properties were updated every day, so sorting by new was tedious to find new listings as a bunch of the same commercial properties would be ""updated"" each day to be at the top.

* [Zillow (ann arbor)](https://www.zillow.com/ann-arbor-mi/rentals) - Zillow

* [ICC Co-ops](https://icc.coop/) - Inter-Cooperative Council page for Co-op housing. 

* [Craigslist Apartment search](https://annarbor.craigslist.org/search/apa) - Usually spammed by the same area complexes over and over, which is what made craigslist so hard to use and forced people to facebook. There are still some listings here though, it just takes some scrolling.

The listed rents are low, at least 2-3 years old, maybe more, but gives a good overview of the entire area. **Most comprehensive listing I've seen in a readable format.** Only reason this isn't under listings is because all of the rents quoted are old and there are no links to the actual websites, just a form for contact email that goes who knows where.

**Remember to exercise caution when looking for housing.** Lots of scammers out there. Check their main profiles if on facebook to see if they match the user who reached out to you. See if you can verify them anywhere else that they actually live in the area. Beware of people pushing you to send deposit money without showing you the place. Please refer to the PDF survival guide located at the top of the post. It can save you money and just as importantly time, not having waste time and effort to interact with scammers. Most instances of people telling you to message them as replies to your posts on facebook are scams. Make sure they have listings on the group, not just replies to people looking as comments like that can't be screened. Most legit people will contact you first and have a listing already in the group.


**Fall sublets will be uncommon.** Most of the Winter sublets you've seen posted are people who failed to find a Fall-only sublet and are trying to recoup some of the un-used lease remaining. Be especially wary when searching for Fall-only sublets. Scammers count on people being desperate to bypass their warning senses. Some apartment complexes like Woodbury Gardens(2-15 and 21 month), and the complexes owned by Village Green(6 and 9 month) may offer shorter lease terms than 12 month. Be aware the shorter term leases will be more expensive per month.
Mckinley Properties don't allow less than 12 month lease but they offer a early termination option which costs 2x monthly rent and requires a 60 day notice. This could be just as good as a shorter lease. I'd confirm it with the leasing office but this should be for all washtenaw county mckinley properties.


The Ann Arbor city bus line can make some affordable locations more practical. Your student ID lets you ride free. A short bus ride can be not too much worse than a medium/long walk. Beware some buses run more commonly than others

I'm so happy it is snowing.,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gwi5bj/im_so_happy_it_is_snowing/,218,16,2024-11-21 14:56:04,I'm from out of state so I have seen snow maybe like 5 times in my life and walking outside today felt so magical.
I hope this reaches you. You lived at 1700 Geddes and found me in the parking lot with a broken spine. You saved my life.,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gvx8qs/i_hope_this_reaches_you_you_lived_at_1700_geddes/,1936,49,2024-11-20 19:02:01,"Peter? I really hope that’s your name. My memory of that night is unsteady, but for some reason I just remember that name. 

It was three years ago on this day, around 2 AM. I can’t imagine what it must have been like for you, to find me, to call 911, and to have no idea what happened before or after. I don’t know if they had to take your statement, or if the paramedics ever contacted you at all. So if you don’t know what happened, let me tell you now. 

I was on my way home from a UMix late night event. I was sober, in a skirt that went down to my shoes. Three of my friends were walking with me, but we split off about a block from my apartment because I didn’t want them to miss their bus. 

I walked home the way I’d done hundreds of times, walked through the lobby of 1700 Geddes, and took the elevator. 

I got to the third floor. I lived at the end of the hall. There was someone there, trying to get into his room. I walked past him, to my door, and started fumbling with my keys to open it. The hall became very quiet. 

Everything gets blurry after that. Everything happened very quickly. He moved so fast. I opened my door and got into my apartment but he was right there, and pushed in after me. I’ve never felt fear like I did in that moment, it was like my brain was shutting down. I saw every possible escape route in my mind but no matter what I was cornered. He was in my apartment. I was right in front of him. I backed away. 

I was passively suicidal long before that night. I had stood on my balcony thinking about it, spent whole evenings there. In that moment my world narrowed down to that balcony. No matter what happened it was an exit. Under the panic and adrenaline it wasn’t the best decision, but it’s the decision I made. 

It took seconds. I stepped onto the balcony’s barrier. I stepped off. 

Then I was lying on my back in the parking lot, and you were talking to me. I have no memory of falling three stories, or of the impact that shattered my ribs, my ankle, and my spine. I remember stepping into open air, and then I remember you. 

I didn’t feel any pain. You asked me if I was alright, and I told you that I needed you to call 911. I think you stayed with me, talking to me, until they arrived. You asked me questions about myself. You told me a little about yourself, too. I really do hope I remember your name, Peter. I don’t like to think about what could’ve happened if you didn’t find me, if I was lying there alone until the sun rose. 

You were with me. The ambulance arrived and they loaded me into it, and I never got to thank you. 

I was in the hospital for 3 months. My ribs and ankle healed completely, but my spinal cord injury paralyzed me from the waist down. I’ll probably be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life. That being said, I’ve made a good amount of progress in the last three years — I’ve gotten some limited muscle motion and feeling back, all the way to my knees, enough that I can kind of shuffle-walk around with a walker. Also my arms are super strong now from wheeling myself everywhere.

I graduated earlier this year with my computer science degree. I adopted a cat and I’m working on my next game development project. I’m alive, and I’m so happy to be alive. The anniversary of this day was pretty rough the last two years, but this year it doesn't hurt as bad to think about. 

I lived. You saved me. Thank you. 

Please try to get this post to Peter, I really hope he sees this. I want him to get the closure that he deserves. If you think you might know him, please send this to him. And if you’re him… I hope you’re doing well. I’d love to talk to you again.

EDIT: WE FOUND HIM! Peter is actually Stephen — I was a few consonants off. u/DisplacedCoasty reached out to me thanks to this post, and after talking to him I can confirm he's the angel who found me, three years ago today. I still can't believe this hail mary found its audience, I love every single one of you."
Looking for advice from law school students! (But any advice is welcome!) :),https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gwn8y4/looking_for_advice_from_law_school_students_but/,17,6,2024-11-21 19:00:14,"Hi everyone! My (22F) boyfriend (25M) is a UMich law student in his last year of studies. We’ve only been dating for a little over a month now, but I really like him and enjoy spending time with him. Though I am an A2 native, I am not a student at UMich or at all, I’m just working right now. He’s told me that this month will be “cursed” as he really has to grind to study for midterms.

I just want to hear from law students about what would be the most helpful gifts to receive during your study grind? I have some ideas of what drinks/snacks to get him, but I basically want to put together a little “self care” basket for him and give it to him as a surprise.

Also, any advice on how to best support him during this period would be much appreciated! We see each other once every weekend, but we talk throughout the week via text. I care about and appreciate him very much, he’s a great boyfriend and I just want to support him as much as he supports me! :,)

We're always curious to hear more about which artists students are actively interested in. We want to know: if you could bring anyone to perform at the University of Michigan (musicians only, please!), who would they be?

If you're interested in the process of producing concerts and coordinating with your favorite artists, bands, comedians, and performers, feel free to follow us @/bigticketumich on Instagram. We regularly give out free tickets to local concerts as well! We'll be recruiting in the winter semester, keep an eye out for us at Winterfest. <3

BREAKING: CSG Elections Data and Voter Information - POLLS CLOSE AT 10 PM TONIGHT,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gwg42b/breaking_csg_elections_data_and_voter_information/,9,12,2024-11-21 13:21:07,"Here is a [link to the Michigan Review Election rundown](https://www.michiganreview.com/november-20th-21st-student-government-elections-everything-you-need-to-know/) I posted before voting opened. [Click here to vote!](http://vote.umich.edu)

The Elections' Team provided a turnout update to the Michigan Review and, as of 7:45 AM today, this is the current results:

All Campus votes: 3,824

LSA: 2,269

Ross: 599

Rackham: 577

Social Work: 91

Dentistry: 43

LSA Student Government: 1,360 votes

Rackham Student Government: 130/221/133/28 (1st-4th years, divided accordingly)

This is significantly lower than last year, after the infamous cancelation of AR 13-025 and 13-026 by the Board of Regents.

Out of the single-seat races (and potentially all races), **the Ross seat** has higher turnout than normal and a 3-way race amongst the three major parties (KEEP IT RUNNING, SHUT IT DOWN, eMpower Michigan).  There are also 6 other independent candidates in the race; none are expected to win but their vote shares and ranked choices further complicate things (no independent uploaded a platform). [Click here to see the full sample ballot.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KUA3oW0ncd1_QVHdYY3y3UrLbkRPMP-e/view)

**KEEP IT RUNNING candidate for Ross, Jason Nuridjanian**, uploaded the most comprehensive platform out of the three candidates:

""Greetings,...

I'm running for the Ross position in the Central Student Government to address pressing issues affecting our student community. As a finance major from Las Vegas, Nevada, I'm actively involved in various faith-based and political organizations here at the University of Michigan, such as the BBA Council. My experiences as a student advocate motivate me to represent our diverse community with transparency and dedication. My platform includes three primary initiatives that aim to foster unity, enhance safety, and ensure freedom of expression on campus.

**1. Safeguarding Student Rights and Free Speech**

Promoting Open Dialogue and Protecting Diverse Perspectives

To nurture a culture of respectful discourse and intellectual diversity, I am committed to advancing policies that protect students' rights to freely express their views. This includes:

● Formation of a Free Speech Council (FSC): This council, composed of faculty, students, and legal experts, will uphold students' free expression rights, review policies, and ensure open dialogue is valued on campus.

● Support for Diverse Student Groups: The FSC will enforce non-discrimination policies to ensure student organizations representing varied perspectives have equal access to resources, free from ideological bias.

● Transparency and Accountability: Clear reporting structures and resolutions for expression rights will ensure that all students feel secure and valued when sharing their perspectives. An annual event celebrating free expression will underscore \[UM’s\] commitment to intellectual inclusivity.

● Constitutional Amendment for Minimum Funding Protection: Establishing a guaranteed minimum funding level for student organizations will protect these groups from arbitrary budget cuts, preserving their ability to thrive and contribute to campus diversity.

**2. Combatting Misinformation and Promoting Inclusive Education**

\-Addressing the Spread of Misinformation and Combating Hate on Campus

Recent studies show that 1 in 5 Gen Z members deny the Holocaust, an alarming trend that threatens historical awareness and understanding of human rights violations. To tackle misinformation and foster an inclusive educational environment, I propose:

● Academic Resource Database on Gaza Conflict and Holocaust Education:

Collaborating with \[UM’s\] library and research departments, this database will provide verified information on the Holocaust and contemporary conflicts, enabling students to critically assess complex topics and counter misinformation with factual, balanced perspectives.

● Strengthened Support and Reporting Mechanisms: Improving \[UM’s\] bias reporting system will allow for more accessible, confidential reporting of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and discrimination, paired with enhanced support services for those affected.

● Monthly Dialogue Panels for Open Discussion: Partnering with communication departments and The Michigan Daily, CSG will host monthly panels on pressing issues.

These events will allow diverse groups to share perspectives, reduce polarization, and foster empathy, promoting a more inclusive campus culture.

**3. Enhancing Campus Safety and Accountability**

\-Creating a Safer, More Secure Campus for All Students

Recent incidents, including vandalism of fraternity houses with hate symbols and aggressive behavior during CSG meetings, highlight the urgent need for improved campus safety. This proposal outlines measures to deter hostile acts and restore a sense of security within our community:

● Increased Security Patrols and 24/7 Presence: Additional security personnel will be deployed around high-risk areas, including fraternity houses, student centers, and CSG meetings, to prevent disruptions and ensure a safer environment.

● Student Safety Program: A student-led watch program, in collaboration with campus police, will enhance surveillance in off-campus student areas, offering rapid response and safety for students.

● Rapid Response Task Force and Immediate Support Services: A specialized task force will respond immediately to hate crimes and harassment reports, enforcing zero-tolerance policies. On-site support hubs will provide immediate counseling and legal guidance following incidents.

● Expanded Mental Health and Crisis Counseling: Increased funding for trauma counseling and personalized safety planning will ensure that affected students have priority access to essential mental health services and safety support.

These initiatives aim to create a safer, more informed, and inclusive campus, ensuring that every student feels respected, supported, and heard. Together, we can build a campus community that values unity, celebrates diversity, and upholds the rights of all.""

**SHUT IT DOWN candidate Sara Ahmed** reposted the identical statement that was also uploaded as a platform by dozens of other SHUT IT DOWN candidates which reads as follows:

""For over a year, Palestinians have endured one of history’s most heavily documented genocides, with countless homes, schools, and hospitals destroyed, and lives shattered. The University’s financial entanglement with Israel’s military-industrial complex is abhorrent. More than $6 billion of the endowment is tied to private equity firms and military contractors profiting from the occupation and surveillance of Palestinians. We call for the University to divest from genocide and to reinvest in communities destroyed by its imperialist agenda.

SHUT IT DOWN will continue fighting for justice and accountability, reparations for Palestine, and liberation. We propose diverting $440,000 of the CSG budget to Birzeit University’s Rebuilding Hope campaign to rebuild Gaza’s educational infrastructure.\*

To those who argue that these funds are needed elsewhere: our university’s $17.9 billion endowment is more than enough to fund student organizations without $440,000 reserved to “loan” back into student life. This fund is an opportunity to align our budget with our values by investing in the education and freedom of students in Gaza.

For too long, CSG has stood as a buffer, placating student demands while serving the interests of the administration. The SHUT IT DOWN Party exists to disrupt that status quo. Until the University divests from companies complicit in violence against Palestinians and begins reinvesting in communities harmed by these crimes, we refuse to let CSG operate as usual.

EVERY DOLLAR PROFITING OFF OCCUPATION IS BLOOD MONEY. EVERY STUDENT GOVERNMENT MEETING, EVERY ROUTINE AGENDA, EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON “BUSINESS AS USUAL” IS A TACIT ENDORSEMENT OF GENOCIDE. WE CALL ON ALL WHO STAND FOR JUSTICE TO JOIN US IN OUR FIGHT TO DIVEST, TO REINVEST, AND TO DEMAND REPARATIONS FOR THOSE OUR INSTITUTION HAS HARMED.

In solidarity with Birzeit University, with Palestine, and with all oppressed peoples around the world, 

THE SHUT IT DOWN PARTY""

(\*Editor's note: The ""Rebuilding Education in Gaza Act"" was ruled out of order in CSG, which proposed donating $440,000 to Birzeit University. CSG, being registered with SOAS, cannot donate these funds overseas as it is against the rules).

eMpower Michigan candidate Elliot Saye did not upload a platform but is expected to be boosted by CSG's long-running establishment, according to multiple sources.

It is unclear who has the upper hand but, publicly on Instagram, the only candidate actively campaigning is Jason Nuridjanian. SHUT IT DOWN has not promoted their candidates whatsoever this election, following their recent mass-resignation and public statement indicating they will be leaving CSG in regards to their activism.

**The LSA race** is a complete unknown, with KEEP IT RUNNING and eMpower Michigan each heavily campaigning for their 9 LSA representatives. About half of each slate uploaded platforms, with candidates Alex Richmond (KEEP IT RUNNING), Isaac Gardner (KEEP IT RUNNING), Wade Velky (KEEP IT RUNNING), Riley Kina (eMpower Michigan), Tyler Hart (eMpower Michigan), Jessica Rehberg (eMpower Michigan), Keshava Demerath-Shanti (Independent) have the most detailed platforms (which can be viewed on the voting page at vote.umich.edu). With 83 candidates for 9 seats, the proportional voting system will likely distribute seats based on total vote share, with no outright majority for any party being a likely scenario.

**The Rackham race** has a lower turnout than expected, which a source said to the Review could be due to SHUT IT DOWN's withdrawal and heavily GEO (Graduate Employee's Organization) voting demographic. KEEP IT RUNNING was the only party to field candidates for all 4 seats, followed by SHUT IT DOWN with 3 and eMpower Michigan with 2 seats.  Devin Woodruff (eMpower Michigan), Lisa Vaiman (KEEP IT RUNNING), and Catreen Marji (Independent) have the [most detailed platforms of the 15 candidates running](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-9YHMf8hHjhMeY05VfBztPVpkPJOobLc/view).

**The Social Work** race is a 3-way push for one seat between SHUT IT DOWN's Farah Huq, an independent that affiliates with both KEEP IT RUNNING and eMpower (Reyhaneh Najafi Koupaei), and another independent named Hana Kisswani. Only Reyhaneh Najafi Koupaei and Hana Kisswani uploaded unique platforms, with the [full list available at this link.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pdj0NoOPMPBKAaIC3aJwjyqINeRwt8Aa/view) With barely any voters for Social Work, this seat could quite literally be determined by this subreddit.

**Dentistry** has 1 candidate running unopposed with the KEEP IT RUNNING party (Jonah Attia) who is expected to win easily.

One last note: [KEEP IT RUNNING is the only party also running candidates in the **LSA SG election**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arXbzv3T3C1bouMOqzMXVi3KphU2f7RbFijnKUZt3bc/edit?gid=1471791197#gid=1471791197), running 7 and endorsing 1.

The 3 Constitutional amendments on the ballot are also widely expected to pass, with both KEEP IT RUNNING and eMpower Michigan signaling their support for all 3, while SHUT IT DOWN endorsed 13-002 (Disability Advocacy Position Creation).

Please distribute this information and the [voting link](http://vote.umich.edu) as wide as possible! This election will literally be determined by dozens of votes and student org funding is the talk of the campaign! Feel free to also AMA about other candidates, procedures and the impending impeachment trial beginning this Friday. Be nice too, please!"

First Semester Transfer Student,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gwlkps/first_semester_transfer_student/,0,1,2024-11-21 17:55:26,Hey all! This is my first semester as a transfer and it has been a wake up call in many ways. I’m doing fine in all of my classes except my psychology class after I just bombed this most recent exam. It’s been quite an adjustment with how I’m supposed to academically approach everything. My question is: I have to get an 85% on my third exam to get a c- and a 97 to even get a solid C. Am I able to take a W at this point or should I just aim for the C-? I feel so out of my depth and I’ve never gotten below a 3.5 in anything so I’m just really freaking out about what I should do.

Advice on argue EECS 370 Honor Code Violation False Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gw5tsb/advice_on_argue_eecs_370_honor_code_violation/,14,1,2024-11-21 02:40:01,"This evening I received an email saying that I have violated the honor code in terms of p1s and already being reported to the committee, which I found confusing.

  
I passed all the projects before linker with one single time of submission (sometimes with few more submission for test cases, which might seems suspicious, but I can easily pass all the test and get all green even in EECS 281 with few times of submission cuz I always check everything carefully before I start to code). In p1s, I was reusing the test case in previous projects so I don't even need the second submission for test cases. I checked my git log for p1s, but because it was too easy I don't even have to make a git for it (I can write out my code in this projects on paper with my eyes folded). 

  
I checked my social media history seeing that I post something like ""generate 24GB of trash txt with buggy p1m solution"" in the same day I finished p1s and p1m, which can only prove I was writing p1m by myself. I also have a double check of the project logic with my friend before I start, we did not see each other's code so he does not have an honor code violation (I have the chat history of go to his desk in the library to find him discuss about the project logic), and after I passed with only one submission, I rushed to his seat with my laptop to show him off. He says he can prove for me in front of the committee, but I believe it is not good evidence.



I have to say this was a personal blow to me because I had always thought I was doing well ini EECS370, I had reached the upper quarter of the midterms score and wanted to apply for a TA position, I attends office hour every week, and I think many TA's were already familiar with me (I always discussed my code logic with them in great detail, but it starts from p2 because previous projects are too easy). I heard that the case was reported to the Honor Committee if and only if the staff had already mastered enough evidence, which made me even more confused. At the same time, I wanted to know what kind of evidence to provide to prove my innocence.



It was the first time for me to experience this kind of thing, which made a lot of negative effect on my state of study, to be honest I'm pissed off right now. Meanwhile, it should be noted that my post is not intended to mislead anyone, because my own words can never be regarded as truth, but I do want to ask you guys what good evidence I can provide to the committee and whether being reported reported to the honor Committee means a high probability of being sentenced."

402 is just **Cravino** (1.8/5), but Zamulin (3.3/5) might do winter of 2025? Not sure. They also both do cumulative finals, unfortunately.

How bad is 251? Should I wait for a chance at Asenova?

Transfer Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gul0fj/transfer_advice/,0,1,2024-11-19 01:04:20,"Hi everyone. I’m currently a CC student planning on transferring to umich for CS but something came up that I would love input on.

I’m currently in the LSA transfer to the humanities program, and my school has had a 70%-80% acceptance rate for students in the program. I’ve also been told that all CS students got approved to the major if they were accepted. I have still kept my grades high regardless because I know that umich is a hard school to get into.

For the Winter 25 transfer admissions apparently all of the CS students got rejected and it seems like umich isn’t really taking CS transfers. I might have to change majors to go there. Here are the options I’m considering:

Go to LSA for DS. DS is similar but I fear it may limit my opportunities because it’s more of a focused field.

Change to CoE for computer engineering. I think I would like it but my acceptance rate would go down because the transfer program applies to LSA only

Give up on umich and go to MSU for CS

I could still apply for CS but it seems like all people who did advance selection got rejected completely and didn’t have an opportunity to pick a different major. 

If anyone has insights that would be great. I would love to hear input on the programs or advice anyone has on transferring. Thanks!"

SI 649 vs Biostat/Stats 449,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gu96xz/si_649_vs_biostatstats_449/,1,0,2024-11-18 16:47:50,"Can anyone give some thoughts on either one of these classes? I'm a senior studying Data Science but I'm a double major so I have a fair amount of classes to take next semester. From what I can see, SI 649 has a median grade of an A, but looks to be higher workload (and I'm not even sure I'll get the override for that class). Biostat is A- median but lower workload? But then I've also seen that if you have a stats background, biostats isn't too bad. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? I'm looking for something that is not too hard and not really high in workload. I don't mind putting in the effort at all, but as a second semester senior I'm going to be (and already am) burnt out.

485 + 481 + 492 combo?,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gu7odw/485_481_492_combo/,0,10,2024-11-18 15:44:56,"hi, looking at this potential combo for the upcoming semester. Wonder how doable this is? Thank you."
Professional Fraternities ,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gtk27x/professional_fraternities/,36,10,2024-11-17 18:27:33,"Professional fraternities have become a big thing on campus, but I want people to remember this about them:

As someone in a frat, I promise you, getting rejected is not a reflection of your worth and don’t let it defeat you. After being on the other side of rush, I know that getting cut is more of a reflection of how many people you talked to, not on your experience in the profession. 

Sometimes people get cut for saying problematic things or being mean to another rushee, but most people don’t do that. The goal is to get to know as many members as you can so they can get to know you and you can decide if you think you vibe with people you meet. Remember that it is a two way street, even if there is an imbalance in power, you have as much choice to not join a frat if you dont like it. Don’t be in one just because you think it’d look good on a resume. Be in it if it lifts your confidence. 

If someone ever tells you that their professional frat is better than yours or the one you are rushing, ignore them. Each one is full of regular students like you and me and that statement is a reflection of insecurity. I’ve met awesome people and questionable people in every frat, sorority, organization, club, etc. 

It’s easy to fall into group think and believe that the one you’re in is the best, but that’s incredibly subjective. If someone makes a point to prove they are “better”, they definitely are not because secure people don’t try and prove their eliteness. 

Remember, each frat is just a bunch of undergraduate students looking for direction, they are not better than you or anyone else. We are all students who are trying to figure ourselves out. 

Keep putting yourself out there and don’t let competition defeat you. Be yourself and you’ll find your people. "
New/Transfer Students Advice & Resources ,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gtnl6w/newtransfer_students_advice_resources/,11,1,2024-11-17 21:02:45,"Hi! I’ll attach some advice for new/transfer students below: 

A lot of new/transfer students have told me they can have a rly hard time when it comes to knowing what is going on at campus and what resources there are. There’s a lot so it can seem very overwhelming and hard to navigate. 

I’m sure transfer students know about the transfer student center, so I’ll skip over that info. (If you don’t know about it, look up transfer student center at umich)

Link to browse general campus resources - https://campusinfo.umich.edu/article/academic-resources 

****Academics 

1. Atlas 
    1. https://atlas.ai.umich.edu/ 
    2. Atlas, displays current and historic data about the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor campus curriculum to inform U-M students, instructors, and staff in decision-making. It is a great way to see how students feel about a class’s work load , their passion for the class after taking it, and feedback about the professors who have taught the class. You can also build a schedule in Atlas to make registering for classes much easier. 
    3. People also use https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ to read about professors 

1. Services for Students with Disabilities Office (SSD) 
    1. https://ssd.umich.edu/ 
    2. The SSD office is a great resources for anyone who needs academic or health accomodations. If you need any physical, mental, or academic accomodations, reach out to the office, they are super friendly and always want to help. 
    3. Some popular accomodations are testing accomodations, attendance accomodations, priority registration, or transportation accomodations. I have accomodations, so I have direct experience with them, and I recommend utilizing this resource.  

1. optiMize 
    1. https://www.optimizemi.org/
    2. Optimize is an organization at the University of Michigan that offers programs, courses, mentorship, and funding for students of all ages and majors to work on self-directed projects.
    3. They have an application for funding for any students interested in starting an org, but they also have transfer student specifc funding which is a great resource for transfer students looking to create something. 

1. Transfer Credit Equivalency Site 
    1. https://transfercredit.ugadmiss.umich.edu/ 
    2. This website is great if you need to check if you can transfer credits from another college to UofM
    3. You can also search a class at Umich and see what other colleges have this class if you want to take a class at a community college during the school year or in the summer. For example, I can look up ECON 101 and see what community colleges also teach the class in case you don’t want to take the class at UofM. A lot of people do this for mandatory classes that are notoriously hard at UofM like math or econ classes so they can protect their GPA. I personally take all my classes at UofM but I know a lot of people who do this. 

1. Looking at old an old syllabus
    1. https://webapps.lsa.umich.edu/cg/ 
    2. If you want to look at prior syllabi for a course, visit the LSA course guide (above) and search the class. Once you search the class, click on one of the courses and scroll to the bottom and click “visit historical syllabi” 

1. Office Hours 
    1. GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    2. It is the easiest way to raise your grade in almost any class, GSI’s and professors will literally give you the answer and check your work so if you are stuck on something, GO! 
    3. Going to a GSI’s office hours to look over your paper (not professor’s unless they are the ones grading it) is the best way to raise your grade. I’ve had multiple GSIs give me WAY higher grades after attending office hours even for like 10 minutes 



****Opportunities

1. Internships 
    1. https://careercenter.umich.edu/ 
    2. The Student Career Center is a great place to start an internship or job search. You can view their resources and listings on the website, and you can make an appointment with them for any reason. They do a lot fo resume help and often have workshops or sessions you can go to. I highly recommend browsing through their wesbite. 
    3. https://umich.joinhandshake.com/login - Handshake is a platform Michigan uses for internship listings, and I got an internship through Handshake (more info on it can be found on the CC website). 
    4. There are also multiple internship, job, and study abroad fairs, so keep a look out for those events! 

1. Campus Jobs 
    1. https://studentemployment.umich.edu/ 
    2. The Student Employment Office is a great resource for finding on-campus and off-campus job listings. Many students find jobs this way, but make sure you look into how you should apply to the job because sometimes you need to email the employer to get a response. Sometimes people apply through the website and get no response because that isn’t where all employers check for applications apparently. 

****Organizations 

1. Finding Organizations/Clubs to join 
    1. During the fall semester, festifall is a great way to find clubs. The event takes place at the beginning of the semester, so keep an eye out for flyers and announcements around campus. However, know that this event can be very overwhelming for people because there are so many clubs that the entire diag is full of booths. Find a map for festifall and you can see what types of clubs are where because they are organized spatially by type of org/club/frat/sorority. 
    2. During the winter, the same event happens again but in the Union because it is cold. The event itself is the same as festifall so don’t worry if you missed festifall or are transfering during the winter semester. 
    3. For those who cannot make it to either, visit https://maizepages.umich.edu/ to research the different clubs/orgs on campus. 
    4. Every org/club is different when it comes to getting in as some require an application/rush process while others are open to anyone and have no application. So if you don’t want to go through applications, there are plenty of orgs/clubs that are open to all. This can be a great way for people to get experience before applying for competitive clubs, but many applications for competitive clubs do not require any experience, they just want to see commitment. 

1. Social Greek Life 
    1. This is a very controversial topic, so I’ll give my honest opinion, but many people will probably disagree with me, so take this with a grain of salt. Social greek sororities have a rough process and environment. Most of the demographic is white and wealthy and exclude people of color or those in lower classes. Whether they say this or deny it, they base getting into a sorority on your attractiveness and connections rather than your kindness or experience. I have many friends in greek life but my opinion on it will not change. I’m talking about the majority, not every single person. Personally, I would avoid it, and the whole system itself is losing popularity because people are fed up with it. Girls rush during the winter semester which is good in my opinion because then you have to make friends outside of greek life before rushing. This change was actually made because greek life got shut down in 2017 because UofM was pissed off with the disgusting nature of ranking people so inhumanely so they made it where everyone has to wait and make friends. A lot of people make friends and realize they don’t need greek life so they don’t end up rushing. The fraternities rush during both semesters but I would highly recommend not joining a frat if you don’t want to be hazed and have your grades be terrible. Pledges are treated horribly, the only one I know doesn’t haze is DTD, and most guys in it are actually very normal and friendly. Again, I have friends in fraternities, but after hearing their experiences… stay away tbh. There’s a lot of messed up stuff happening behind the scenes. Look at the website GreekRank if you want to see how dumb it really is. 

1. Professional Fraternities/Sororities  
    1. In my opinion, professional fraternities is a great way to do the fun parts of social greek life like formals or social events without having to spend thousands of dollars in dues. They are also usually much more diverse and offer the professional help as well. However, know that people can be really hard on themselves if they don’t get into a professional frat because it is a competitive process, but just be yourself and be kind and you’ll be okay. You don’t need them to be successful and remember most people get cut because of the sheer number of rushees, not because you did anything wrong. Try and talk to as many people you can during rush, that’s the best advice I can give (but don’t be mean to another rushee so you can talk, that is a common way people get cut, it comes off as rude and inconsiderate). 

1. Multicultural Greek Life 
    1. This is different than the Panhellic Greek Life system. Multicultural fraternities and sororities serve racial, ethnic, and cultural communities but still have the social aspects of panhellic greek life. I have many friends in these fraternities and sororities and they speak very highly of it. It makes me sad that there has to be an entire new greek life system for people of color because they are so excluded from panhellic greek life, but obviously that is now the sole reason for their creation. It is a great space to find communitiy in your culture and helps a lot of people understand their own identity. To learn more visit: https://fsl.umich.edu/topic/multicultural-greek-council

I noticed they stated cats must be fixed and declawed. Does anyone know if they actually enforce it? My cat is a registered esa if that makes a difference.
 My cat is fixed but me and my family are very against declawing cats because it’s inhumane; it’s basically if we were to cut our fingers off at the last knuckle. I’d be willing to put claw caps on him but I could never put him through declawing. My vet refuses declaws bc it’s inhumane and said since my cat is a senior cat putting him under anesthesia especially for a pointless procedure wouldn’t be worth the risk. "

We are a student organization on campus supported by UM's Speech Neurophysiology Lab, and in an effort to bring more awareness to stuttering, we splurged to host a screening of one of the most famous movies of all time free for you to attend. We will also be offering **free popcorn and sodas**!

The King's Speech is a movie about King George VI's ascension to the throne and how he navigated his stutter to give his first radio broadcast upon Britain's declaration of war on Germany. Stuttering is a frequently overlooked disorder that remains under-recognized even amidst recent efforts to raise awareness about mental health issues, so we'd like to bring this movie to the forefront of Ann Arbor's attention this weekend. We hope you can join us in this effort!

To participate, just show up to the State Theatre (233 S State St) at around 3:30-4 pm and mention A2STAR. We will be doing a stuttering Q&A for the first section, so bring any and all questions you may have about stuttering! I'm looking forward to meeting y'all.

I have this **bad** habit of never going to lecture and also getting lazy on watching the lecture recordings.

I realized if there was a way I could more efficiently get the content out of the lectures that would save me a lot of time.

That's why I built Talk Tuah Lecture.

It's designed *exclusively* for U-M lecture captures.

It lets you ask questions about your lecture and skip to where the professor talks about certain topics.

Say you're taking a calculus class and you're confused about u-subsitution.

You can tell TTL, ""Go to where u-sub is discussed"" then it will skip to that part of the lecture, saving you the trouble of finding it.

Or

You can paste in content from your lecture slides and ask TTL, ""What does the professor say in the lecture that's not on the slides?""

Since it costs me to run the service, I'm charging $4.99/mo for it with a 1-week free trial - I hope that's affordable enough.

I also need to do a capstone at some point, but I think it's recommended to take your capstone after having gotten some more experience with ULCS courses? 

I'm hoping to get some recommendations on ULCS courses (and maybe capstone courses too) to take! For reference, I liked the projects in 280,281 and did/have done pretty well on them, but I did not really enjoy 203/376, so I'd like to avoid courses of that nature from now on if at all possible.

I don't really have any specific direction I'm interested in going in, so I'm open to different kinds of courses! If anyone has any strong recommendations (and maybe a brief description of the course, because I'm struggling to get an actual understanding of what the ULCS classes are like without visiting the course pages which is a bit time-consuming) that would be great!!

Also if anyone actually thinks taking a capstone next semester could be a good idea, lmk!! I don't know anyone else that is ahead of me on the CS track so I don't really have any students to go to for advice/recommendations.

Tech and App. Elective for DS majors, open to all majors

[**Practical Data Science**](https://practicaldsc.org/), offered as EECS 398-002 and 398-003 in Winter 2025, will train students to use industry-standard tools to solve real-world problems, while giving them an understanding of how these tools work under the hood. Students will learn how to work with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, and Jupyter Notebooks, and also learn the math behind loss functions, gradient descent, linear and logistic regression, and other key ideas in machine learning. Watch this [**overview video**](https://youtu.be/Z75-_YK5_XM?si=lyDVHfXMgHi4ytBY) for more details.

The course is being offered for the first time in Fall 2024. You can access all current course materials, including lectures and homework assignments, at [**practicaldsc.org**](http://practicaldsc.org). Here’s what one current student said (anonymously):

>I couldn’t recommend this class enough! I’m a second year CS-LSA student and I’m taking this class as my first ULCS class with EECS 281. Despite not having the strongest foundation in linear algebra coming in, I’ve found the material very accessible with a bit of extra effort. The lectures, led by Suraj, are both engaging and informative; he has a talent in presenting complex ideas in a clear and interesting way that keeps you interested. The homework assignments are particularly cool—they push you to think creatively while applying what you’ve learned in class. The course is manageable with consistent effort, and I’ve found the resources provided by the staff to be helpful for filling in any gaps. If you’re interested in diving deeper into data science and machine learning concepts, I’d definitely recommend taking this course.

The prerequisites are discrete math (EECS 203), programming (EECS 280), and linear algebra, or consent of the instructor. If you’re interested in the course but don’t meet the prerequisites, reach out to me (the instructor, Suraj Rampure) at **rampure@umich.edu** to chat further – we’re happy to support interested students from all majors. (In particular, we’ve made a [**Linear Algebra Review**](http://practicaldsc.org/lin-alg) guide specifically for this class.)

See [**practicaldsc.org/next**](http://practicaldsc.org/next) with more logistical information if you’re interested in enrolling. Hope to see you in the winter!

However, I’ve hit a snag with course prerequisites and could really use some advice.

The main challenge is that some of the courses I’ve taken (or am planning to take) at UW don’t fully align with UMich’s prerequisite requirements. Specifically, I’m worried about Calculus-based Physics and General College Chemistry, which seem to be crucial for transferring but don’t match up perfectly with UW’s offerings or course sequence.

I’m also concerned that these course discrepancies might prevent me from being able to transfer in time for Fall 2025. This has been causing me a lot of stress, as I really want to make sure I’m on track and meet all the requirements.

I’d really appreciate any insights on:

1. How strict UMich is about having these exact courses completed before transferring.
2. If there are any options for making up these courses over the summer or taking them online.
3. Any tips from students who have successfully transferred to UMich COE, especially if they had to deal with similar course mismatches.

This winter will be the inaugural offering of **EECS 479: Introduction to Quantum Computing**. Well actually, it's the third offering, but before it had the temporary number EECS 498-001. I wanted to make sure folks were aware of the availability.

  
This is a lab-oriented class exploring the potential ways quantum computing may (and may not) change the computing stack, all the way from the logic level up through the algorithm and application layers. We’ll have weekly labs and programming assignments throughout the semester. The workload has been ranked as ""moderate"" from previous students. If you are unfamiliar with quantum computing and want a non-technical overview, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28) is one of the better pop-science explanations.

The class has been approved to count for 4 credits of ""upper-level CS"" and ""upper-level CE"" elective requirements for undergrads and 4 credits of ""graduate level credit"" for grad students. No physics or linear algebra background is needed, but we’ll assume you are comfortable with logic and datapath design à la EECS 370. If you don’t meet the prerequisites but are still interested, feel free to shoot me an email and we can discuss if it makes sense for you to take the class this semester. I’m also happy to take any questions here. ([Course website from last year](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs498.001/) – keep in mind there will be changes for the current offering)

lsa/bba dual degree help!!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gra3ym/lsabba_dual_degree_help/,2,2,2024-11-14 17:27:48,"hello!

i'm currently a lsa 1st year interested in a lsa/bba dual degree (ppe at lsa), so i'd need to apply for the dual degree this winter.

but, i'm not sure if i should because i don't know if i'll be able to graduate in 4 years (my advisor said that a lot of people take an extra sem) + i want to study abroad (i know lots of ross students study abroad, but i want to do an oxford nonbusiness-related study abroad).

also, i'm not sure if my reasons justify a dual degree—i want to do ppe because i love how interdisciplinary it is (still undecided tho), but i mainly just want to do ross for the better job prospects (end goal is law school). my questions for anyone with any experience:

1. how was the workload (and how big were your outside time commitments) + in how many years did you graduate?

2. why did you want to pursue a lsa/ross dual degree?

3. this is an aside, but i'm pretty introverted, and i know that shouldn't keep me from applying to ross, but i'm afraid i won't fit in.

THANKS SO MUCH!!!"

I tried reaching out to professors to get an override for the 2nd half term classes, but they denied me saying it was too late.

Right now, it’s a 3 way race between SHUT IT DOWN, KEEP IT RUNNING and Empower.

All 3 have near complete slates, per sources, other than Empower missing 2 Rackham candidates. Also, Empower and KEEP IT RUNNING are both de facto endorsing the same Social Work candidate.

SHUT IT DOWN virtually needs no introduction but, to be concise, they tried to shut down all government funding and, after 3 months of success, the University stepped in and restored funding. Due to missing meetings and outright resigning, SHUT IT DOWN went from 22/45 seats to 7/45, as it currently stands. Eventually, these procedural shortcomings led to CSG restoring funding to their programs too on 10/23 for the rest of the year (essentially). Many are former reps or candidates trying to get their seats back.

KEEP IT RUNNING has an Instagram with their platform to enshrine student orgs in the constitution. I will also be asking them for their other plans soon.

Empower Michigan just created an Instagram and I will be editing this post with that info.

Meet the Candidates will be hosted at the Michigan Union in the Wolverine Room on the 3rd floor (officially 6-7:15 PM but I’ll be there early and stay late). I want some of y’all to give me good reader submitted questions to ask candidates from all parties! I will report back with my results! Thank you!"

We were heading to our parked car on church across from the parking structure, but we started getting shouted at from an apartment building's rooftop from a group of three obviously inebriated hooligans. ""HEY YOU TWO! GIVE US YOUR NUMBER"", they kept slurring that repeatedly. We were startled but we tried to laugh it off in good faith. My friend made the mistake of entertaining them, shouting back a fake number. We asked them how old they were, to which they replied 18. Obviously much older, we laughed it off saying ""too young, have fun though"", at this point they kept shouting at us trying to illicit a response and our discomfort was apparent as we scrambled for our keys so we could just get the fuck out of there. They started dialing the number she gave them and when they realized it was fake, they starting shouting cusses at us. At this point, we just jumped into the car and hit the engine but to our shock they threw a beer can at our car from the roof then hid like the cowardly juvenille pricks they are.

I've got lots of flexibility time-wise.  I prefer to meet on/near central campus, but I can do north campus too if needed.  Send me a chat on here to discuss availability.  You've still got time to learn the material before finals!

  
edit: I know the NMR components of 211 and 216 can be really tough.  I've taught dozens of undergrads NMR, and I know I can make this the easy part for you!!"

I also have to do MATH 214/217 and EECS 281 at some point too, and would not want to stack those either on top of each other and/or 451/452.

I made a social app to create quicker hangouts with college friends at UMich and I just released it on the App Store!,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gnol9t/i_made_a_social_app_to_create_quicker_hangouts/,36,9,2024-11-10 00:47:50,"Hey everyone!

I'm currently a senior at Michigan studying Business. I realized that there's a serious problem within organizing spontaneous hangouts on campus with your friends. Texting a bunch of people (especially across different friend groups) is super inconvenient, and I think we're missing tons of opportunities to be more social throughout our days. Those little moments make up our college experience and instead we're just doing stuff alone because texting is so annoying 

I recently developed a mobile app called Push to try and replicate that freshman dorm experience, where you could instantly have friends instantly join you on campus through creating a quick ""push"" (hangout). 

For example, if you just finished a class, you could instantly send a ""push"" to eat lunch at South Quad to all your friends without having to text a bunch of people. Then, the app creates an in-app group chat with all the people who accept for you guys to coordinate details. Our UI makes this whole process literally takes less than 5 seconds.

I would absolutely love it if you guys could download and try the app out ! For social apps, those network effects are extremely important, so would love if you could share with your friends, group chats, and GroupMe's 

 I'm looking for constructive feedback on how we can change the UI/UX and also get more adoption on campus. It's really hard to market student-made apps on campus, so anything you do to help out would be super appreciated :) 

  
Here's the App Store link: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/push-friends-umich/id6502925758?platform=iphone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/push-friends-umich/id6502925758?platform=iphone)

You can also search ""push umich"" to find it 

We will build an Android version if we see enough positive feedback on the iOS version. 

If you have feedback, there's a ""text a founder"" button in the profile page so you can directly contact me and my co-founder. We'd love to hear from you!! If you find the app useful or cool, it would be amazing if you could leave a great review.

Thanks for reading all this! Hope you guys enjoy Push!!!!!"

I don't plan on majoring in creative writing but I want a school that has a robust program for it and bonus points if they have a debate or MOCO team.

I'm fairly extroverted and I went to a really toxic and hyper-competitive high school where I didn't have the chance to have fun or branch out (for reference, you will get stares if you participate in spirit week, barely half of us dress up for halloween, and we don't even have a football team).

I'm not a party animal or anything by any means, but I DO want to at least attend a few good parties, branch out, get to know people, see what real school spirit is like, and have some fun for once, though I don't want to join greek life at all.

I haven't really been able to find much anecdotal information online for how english and creative writing is at UMichigan. Are the programs good? Are there any weeder classes or ones with bad GSIs for english or Polisci? How competitive are those majors? Law school acceptance rates? Humanities research opportunites for undergrad?

UX Major in School of Information,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gmvnfa/ux_major_in_school_of_information/,1,0,2024-11-08 22:58:46,"Hi everybody! 

I'm interested in the UX major in the School of Information. I've heard a variety of things about the program, both positive and negative, and would love to gather some more information. 

Firstly, is the program worth it? If I were to go this route, I would potentially double major in Cognitive Science and minor in Computer Science (also does anyone know if you have to apply to get into the Computer Science minor?) I have some prior experience in UX and am involved in some academic related projects. 

Secondly, does the UX major provide ample opportunity to get involved with projects? 

Thirdly, what are the career prospects like for this major? I know that UX itself is a bit of a challenging field at the moment to get into but was wondering if UMSI helps land positions at all or provides good network opportunities? I've reviewed the career outcomes page UMSI has but know that some of that data may be skewed due to dual students from Ross or other programs. 

And finally, are the courses in this major ""too easy""? That may sound weird, but I'm a person who likes to be constantly challenged with their schoolwork and have heard from previous posts that the classes are too easy. 

Thank you all for any information you can provide!"

STATS 250 - Suggestions for Help with Learning Concepts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1glbon1/stats_250_suggestions_for_help_with_learning/,7,5,2024-11-06 22:56:02,"Hi, I'm in Stats 250 rn, and I'm struggling a lot with actually like retaining the information from lecture.

Beneath this paragraph I'm mostly complaining about the class structure and explaining why I'm having such a hard time, but the gist is basically that I would like to find a (free) resource that can help me learn the concepts in 250 that's mostly text-based maybe with short audiovisual elements, but that is generally digestible for people who already have some idea of what is going on and just need a little extra reinforcement of the main topics and reminders on what certain things (like t-tests is a big one I'm struggling with) mean functionally and the calculations we can use to find them. If you have any suggestions for anything like this that could be helpful, I'd really appreciate it!!!

I'm trying really hard to do well in this class and to understand the concepts, but I'm really frustrated with the lack of options for different learning strategies in the course. The professor whose lectures I attend (and I go to all lectures, only have missed a handful, because I'm taking the 'active approach' for lectures which means I need to attend lectures and complete short assignments during lecture that contribute toward my grade) doesn't have her lectures recorded, which is a little bit frustrating. The main issue I'm having with the class though is that lecture/lecture recordings is genuinely the only way to learn the material in the class -- like they don't publish the annotated slides after lecture, they don't have a page of course notes that has completed explanations of course concepts, like nothing. All of the assignments are just questions you have to do on your own (which yeah it's an assignment so that makes sense), but you're expected to just go based on your notes from lecture to help you complete the assignments because the only other thing there is to go off of is the lecture recordings. They go through the slides pretty quickly in class, and all of the slides posted to Canvas have all of these blanks and like mostly-empty slides with an unanswered question at the top, so I literally have to go back and watch lecture recordings if I missed adding anything to my notes during class. BUT like I mentioned before, the professor whose section I'm registered for doesn't have her lectures recorded and posted for some reason. So, I have to watch the lectures from some other professor who has a wildly different teaching style that doesn't work as well for me if I need to go back and review concepts. Which is like ok fine, BUT when I'm just trying to check for clarification on a topic and I know exactly where the professor I watch in person talked about it (like which lecture and which slide), I can't just go to her recording bc it doesn't exist, SO I have to search through a lecture I haven't watched before which takes a lot of time especially when I have to go back multiple times for every assignment.

And if someone who is in the course/taken the course is thinking ab asking if I'm using the 'course notes' (which is like a PDF they release for every lecture that is taken from the slides and is supposed to help you take notes more quickly in lecture -- but it is mostly filled with blanks or the answerless questions), the answer is no. And yeah ik that makes it seem a little bit like it's my fault that I'm struggling, but I'm not trying to print that many pages of paper and have to carry them every time I have stats, and I don't have an ipad which seems to be what most ppl who are around me in lecture are using for that, so it's lowkey not that simple and I think it's a bit silly that they made those notes so inaccessible considering most students tend to use laptops for note-taking anyway. 

I feel like they saw that ""lecture attendance = good"" and ""hand-taken notes = good"" and ran with it when planning their course out, and I'm just really frustrated with this course and the way it's structured. I'm paying a lot to be at this school, and the fact that they've made it so difficult to access the information I need to complete their assignments, learn, and pass their class is really disappointing. I've taken courses in both humanities and natural sciences here and I'm in my fourth year, and this is easily the worst-structured course I've taken yet. 

I think the setup of the course might work for some people (and probably does), but as someone who really needs to sit and read something to make it make sense, the forced audiovisual lessons just aren't cutting it, and I need help finding an alternative at this point. Thanks for reading if you got this far, sorry for being long-winded"

i hate financial aid,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gkjr3i/i_hate_financial_aid/,44,10,2024-11-05 22:50:19,"This is long one, so settle in

A brief about-me: I am an external transfer to Ross from UM-Flint. Main reason why I transferred was that I felt there was something more out there, and Flint wasn’t really cutting it for me. I really liked Ross’s hands on approach to business, and i’ve always been interested in business bc my parents owned a restaurant. I wanted to challenge myself, and as a kid I’ve always wanted to go to the real UM (no offense to Flint). Another reason is im first gen, i’ve grown up lower-ish middle class, and I wanted to have a comfortable life i.e. making lots of money. ANYWAY…

So I applied for Ross, and my acceptance letter came at the end of June (wahoo!). The school emails me and asks me to submit my CSS (remember this for later), and i do that. Finding housing was kind of rough, but i situated myself in a place off Packard. All is well, im really enjoying my classes, making lots of friends, etc.

I got an email one morning about there being a balance on my student account. I thought that was weird, since at Flint i was on the pell grant, and i had the go blue. So I look and I have a charge. I thought it was bc my scholarships hadnt come through, so i gave it a week. 

When they still hadn’t come through by the middle of September (i’m writing this from memory, so im just approximating the dates), I go to the financial aid building and talk to someone. They said that i wasn’t eligible for the pell, probably bc the government changed how they calculated it the pell grant. (Okay, that’s not something the school controls, im not holding it against them.) I also wasn’t eligible for the go blue because our assets were above 75k. I was disappointed, my advisor in flint told me my pell grant would follow me, but it shouldn’t be too bad as long as i get *something*. 

I was eligible for my Michigan Achievement Scholarship though. Cool! Why am i not getting it? Oh, they need my high school transcript, and I would need to go talk to undergraduate admissions. Ok, say less. I go downstairs and talk to undergrad and they say that my transcript hasn’t finished processing. They told me to come back in a few weeks. I wonder how they admitted me without processing my transcript, and I also remembered that they had given me two different emails to send my transcript to (i get it bc bureaucracy, but still). But i just go with it. At this point i was having a pretty terrible day, and in my misery i got joe’s pizza (which made me even more depressed). 

So a few weeks pass, and its the middle of october. I’ve been emailing them for updates but its been slow, i get that they’re busy and stuff. I also left it on the side to bc i got involved in a club and homework and stuff, but one day i decided that enough was enough, i was going to get this thing figured out before i left campus. 

I began my session by locking myself in the fishbowl side classroom and started by calling financial aid. They told me that the same thing: they don’t see my transcript on their end, so off i went to undergrad admissions. This time undergrad told me that since i was a Ross student, i needed to call *Ross Undergrad* to look up my transcript. 

So I called ross undergrad. After a while, they also couldn’t find it and told me to reach out to [transcripts@umich.edu](mailto:transcripts@umich.edu) (they had no phone number). So I email them, and i got a response back the next day. i have screenshots of all of this, but this is basically what they said:

*“Hi InterceptU2,*

*Thank you for contacting Undergraduate Admissions. We received and processed your high school transcript. Ross should also be able to see your file.”*

I wrote back asking if financial aid could see my file too. 

*“Yes the office of financial aid would have access to your application file.”*

Okok cool. So i should be able to get my financial aid. Yippee! I call financial aid as soon as it opened the next day.

me: “Hi, my name is InterceptU2, i’ve been having some problems with my financial aid, I think i got the issue with my high school transcript sorted out.”

financial aid: “Yeah, so it seems like there wasn’t an issue with your high school transcript, but the reason why you’re not getting your aid is bc your CSS submission was submitted late.” 

Ohhhhhhh, so basically i wasted two months trying to diagnose a problem that didn’t exist in the first place AND now i can’t get my aid. Oh, and no one told me what my actual problem was. Excellent. 

Yes, i did submit my CSS late. Thats because i had no idea if i’d actually be getting into Ross in March. Added onto my false sense of security was that email telling me to fill out my CSS. i suppose in their defense, the email didn’t explicitly say that my submission would be CONSIDERED, just that they wanted me to submit it. So i guess i was supposed to interpret it as “you should submit your documents, but we won’t look at them because it's past the due date.”

So i submit an appeal to financial aid asking them to review my CSS submission. I basically told them whats in here plus i attached screenshots of the actual emails. They just told me today my appeal was rejected, and if i want to appeal again, i would need to provide some new documentation. I love AA, but sometimes i wish i stayed in flint.

So i suppose i could go look through my emails and look for new stuff, but pretty much all i gave was all i had. I’m writing this in hopes that someone else has gone through a similar situation and had some advice, but tbh at this point im exhausted. I have the option of taking out loans, but i just don’t think i’d be comfortable with that burden hanging over my head. Luckily my parents are helping me, but i wish i didn’t have to put them through this. We’re not dirt poor, but we’re not rich either. I remember calling them right after i got out of the financial aid office, and after i told them, my dad was quiet for a few seconds before saying, “i’ll figure this out, don’t worry.” i cried so much that day.

Thank you so much for reading this. I really do appreciate it, and i’ll update this post as i learn new things. 

EDIT: I got an approval from the director! Apparently you have to make an incredibly detailed timeline and accept EVERY single email or related evidence. I’ll keep u guys posted!"

ERS and fixit has done NOTHING to help. they are in our BATHROOMS. they are in our DORMS. and it takes fix it a week to arrive just to slap glue traps and not even address possible sources of the spiders. i called them today when i submitted a request days ago and they were like ""oh yeah we're scheduled to come... sometime this week"" as my hallway is getting slowly infested with these spiders.

the showers are probably older than me and are rusty with miscellaneous stains on the curtains and barely any space to move around so u don't touch any of the nasty shower stall walls. the grout of the tiles and the floor and the walls are stained with orange algae/mold. there's so much crusty water stain on the actual shower parts it starts to look concerning. worst part is, there's something wrong with pretty much every single stall.

i know this is just how dorm life is, but i have so many friends living in couzens and mojo and alice lloyd. i have been there and seen their living spaces and bathrooms. TELL ME HOW WE'RE PAYING THE SAME ROOM AND BOARD??? i guess comparison is the thief of joy. getting ripped off of my room and boarding costs. smaller rooms, two outlets per room (one per roommate) which causes major problems with electricity management, old buildings, spiders, everything.

every time i tell people i live in markley, they give me the ""ohh..."" and the pity face. if they're gonna make us live here, at least make us pay a proportional amount of room and board. cause like tell me how alice lloyd or couzens is paying the same room and board as us.

- A C++ course (transfers as ENGR 101)
- Physics 2
- Differential Equations


My reasoning:
- C++ would prep me for Umich EECS courses since I heard that that’s language commonly used, 

-Physics 2 just to get it out of the way, even though the professor I have to choose from all suck 

-Diffeq to knock out the Calc sequence at Umich and either count it as a technical elective for CS or as a requirement for CE. 


Is this a reasonable plan or should I do something swap Diffeq for discrete which would transfer as EECS 203 given all the Reddit posts from this recent midterm 😅

I recently got accepted into LSA as a transfer student for the winter semester from a community college where I have an associate’s degree (did early college in hs). I’m interested in going into biomedical engineering, and multiple people told me to apply to LSA and then transfer to the CoE. 

I haven’t taken any classes very specific to my major, so if I get into it and end up hating it my second “major of interest” would probably be pre-dental. I live in Michigan and plan on commuting to campus. 

I’m currently taking Calc III and Calc-Based Physics I. I’m doing pretty well in both of those classes rn, but I have exams coming up for physics and am worried about the class. The worst case scenario is that I fail, and I’m wondering if that happens what are the chances that I get my acceptance revoked. I’ve never got below a 3.5 in any college class. If I end up doing bad and had to retake the class I know I would do a lot better. My physics professor says our class is MIT level and it’s hard so we can be able to transfer it to any college.

I’m very into music, I play bass guitar and percussion but most enjoy playing in jazz ensembles. My other most significant hobby is arts and crafts, specifically sewing and crochet. I also roller skate and am consumed by fashion. Some hobbies I want to dive deeper into are reading, running, learning different instruments, language learning, and shuffle dance.

Is Michigan Stadium actually sinking? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1ghq17g/is_michigan_stadium_actually_sinking/,121,26,2024-11-02 05:59:10,"Last spring I heard the wildest thing from a friend in civil engineering: Supposedly, Michigan Stadium has been slowly sinking into the ground over the past few years. It’s like half an inch every year, but apparently there’s been enough of a shift that some kind of “ground stability project” is underway to keep it level.

Initially I didn't think much of it.  However, I moved into an apartment near the stadium this year and have noticed GroundProbe vans parked outside pretty frequently (usually on the S. Main St side) They'll set up what looks like measuring equipment every now and then, some of which goes into the ground. The workers are usually in white hard hats with plaid button-ups and jeans, taking readings with iPads. The whole thing seems a bit concerning, but maybe the school dosen't want to alarm anyone or make it a bigger issue than it is.

Just my experience living on and off campus for four semesters during the onset of COVID with a non-standard brain. This is for everyone else on campus struggling with their mental health. I remember hearing the train going thru AA every morning wondering if another student had been lost to it, and when my time would come. Not ashamed of the fact I “flunked out,” I’m happy to simply be alive. 


Thank you for your email. I’m not certain if it was sent in error, as I haven’t been able to return to campus since being placed on Mandatory Leave. However, if you do remember me, I’d like to express my gratitude to each of you for the support you provided during my time at UofM.

With the dedicated help of several doctors, my family, and my care team, I am finally in a place of recovery. I now have a better understanding of why I was struggling so much and why I always seemed to need a bit of extra support.

I’m currently in the process of being diagnosed with Sensory Processing Disorder and Autism. I somehow managed to go 19 years without knowing this, even while attending one of the top schools in the state. I spent so much time comparing myself to others in this highly competitive environment, which led me to a state of despair—at times, even questioning my own survival. It turns out that taking things at my own pace was always what I needed.

While I recognize that it’s not the University’s direct responsibility to manage students’ health, I’d like to encourage you to consider ways to support those who might not “fit the mold,” whether mentally, physically, or otherwise. Students like me—who have also earned a place in this university—sometimes just need a bit more time, support, or a slightly different approach to learning. When I had more space to work at my own pace during COVID, I maintained a cumulative 3.35 GPA. While there were several factors in play, this experience suggests that a bit of additional support can make a big difference. 

With all that said, I do not intend to return to the University of Michigan for my undergraduate studies, in any capacity. Aside from my talent, passion, technical knowledge, and real-life experience doing nearly all things “music,” I’m not confident that UofM could fully accommodate my non-standard learning needs, even with specific adjustments for my sensory challenges. With the full blessing of my family, I plan to pursue my degree and musical studies abroad or in the great city of Detroit.

Thank you again for your efforts to support me through my struggle. Even if we didn’t meet in person, I deeply appreciate your help during my time at the University.

Best regards,

I don't know what major to choose help lol,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gi2ou7/i_dont_know_what_major_to_choose_help_lol/,2,1,2024-11-02 18:16:23,"Hi, I am planning to transfer to LSA in the fall of 2025.

One problem, I do not know what to major in or even what job i want in the future. Noteable classes I've enjoyed in the past have been: cultural anthropology, sociology race and ethnicity, spanish, and art classes.

I am leaning towards the international studies major with either the CCI or ISNC subplan. I like learning about culture, sociology, psycology, anthro, and spanish. The issues with this is that I don't know what job/internship route I would go. Plus, I am a pretty socially anxious and introverted person, and from what I've heard this major can be pretty strenuous in that way. For this reason I am really unsure about this major.

I also might enjoy majoring in anthropology with the sociocultural subplan. Maybe using this degree I could eventually become an archivist which is pretty solitude work which I like.

Other majors I may like are: sociology, linguistics,  arts and the ideas in the humanities, spanish. But again, job prospects are like ?? so idk.

Honestly the best financial option would be doing an economics major. I'm good at math and have taken up to calc 2. It's a social science so it might be interesting to me.  The job prospects are good.

All we really have is the present, and I would really like to spend my next few college years learning things that I enjoy at least for the most part. I am still worried about the future though lol so I would appreciate any advice, guidance, or things to look into?"

update:

Thanks to all commentators caring about the election. What I'm gonna say has little to do with the election, but feel free to continue.

I'm a Chinese international student actually. I posted this because I witnessed a comment saying that Chinese students are stealing US technology.

I wanted to contradict that, but failed to add new comments.

Look, let me speak my mind here. I just cannot imagine how prejudiced that guy is against China and Chinese students, so that he can link these two unrelated issues forcibly.

AND, if you want to talk about spy, let's treat China and the US equally, and I can give you a bunch of evidences indicating that both countries are stealing something from each other.

If you target students, the fact is we students study here legally, and we are free to make use of what we are allowed to learn here. We comply with the laws and regulations. We don't steal.

If you like us Chinese guys, let's communicate and contribute to a better world; if not, compete with us like a man of honor."

Dear Friends,

My team and I at Ross School of Business, UMICH are working on our MBA project for the State of Michigan's Office of Future Mobility & Electrification (OFME) on EV charging infrastructure in multi-dwelling units (MDUs) like condos, apartments, and townhomes. The lack of charging access in these types of housing could prevent broader EV adoption. The findings from this project may impact state policy and be shared with key decision-makers, including the Governor.

If you're a resident, landlord/property manager, developer, or city planner involved with condos, townhomes, or apartments, can you please take one of the short surveys below (about 15-20 minutes). You do not need to be an EV owner to participate — your input is invaluable!

Overall it is a win-win all around. It appears that businesses in the AA area are not really active in this program. It is so disappointing because in other cities I have been able to get some wicked deals. Like over a dozen donuts for just a couple of bucks!

Georgia Tech vs Umich for Civil Engineering Spring Trasnfer,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1ggjm6t/georgia_tech_vs_umich_for_civil_engineering/,5,27,2024-10-31 17:10:08,"Hey everyone! I got accepted to UMich and Georgia Tech for Spring 2025 transfer, with a deposit deadline of December 1 for both. They’re both out-of-state schools, so tuition costs will likely be similar. Currently, I’m at a decent 4-year university, but the engineering program isn’t “top-tier.”

**Major:** Civil Engineering  
**Reason for Transferring:** I want to study public transportation, but my current engineering courses are very automobile-focused. I know UMich has classes on transit, so I’d love to hear more from anyone who’s taken them or knows what the program is like.

**What I’m Looking For:**

* **Location:** I’m looking for a city with solid transit options and a lot going on. My college town has an okay bus system, but it’s unreliable on weekends and only really goes to the mall or downtown. I want to be in a large city with things to do and, more importantly, near engineering firms. Traveling back to NYC for job interviews and conferences every few weeks isn’t easy on my bank account, so being close to these opportunities is important. Ik Atlanta is a big city but idk much about Ann Arbor in terms of size, transit options, or access to engineering firms and events.
* **Environment:** I thrive around motivated students. I went to a competitive high school where students ran food banks, led clubs, tutored, directed teams, etc. I was heavily involved myself because I enjoyed the energy and motivation that environment brought. I assume both UMich and GT have similar student bodies, but any insight into how motivated and engaged UMich students are would be helpful.I also enjoy meeting people in a range of fields and learning about different areas. I’m wondering if UMich’s larger range of programs offers more of that? I’m also thinking about a minor in policy or political science, but not sure if I’ll have the time. My current school has a strong humanities focus, and I love the discussions I have with those students.
* **Food:** This isn’t a huge factor, but what’s the dining hall food like? Are there options for vegetarian/pescetarian/Halal/Kosher diets?
* **Education:** I know every school has its share of good and bad professors, but any general thoughts on the civil engineering department at UMich? My prerequisites are done, so I won’t need math or physics professors, but I’d love any feedback on the department overall.

I have about a month to decide, so any insights would be really helpful! I know everyone’s experience is different, so I’m just curious to hear people’s perspectives. Thanks so much!"

All in all 17 credits. I’m premed and I wasn’t able to sign up for any science/stem classes last year so I feel like I’m behind and need to catch up. 

However, all of the classes I’m taking require an insane amount of attention that I don’t feel like I have. I have an exam basically every other week, which results in me focusing on that one subject more and neglecting the others. And I know that’s a bad method because I’m constantly falling behind.

All that to say, the last drop deadline is tomorrow and I don’t know if I should drop physics to maintain my gpa and scholarship (full tuition) or try to tough it out. I know that if I applied myself I could figure it out and pass, but I don’t see what time I have to do that. Is it worth dropping the class and going down to 12 credits even if it could set me back?

"Feel Uncomfortable and Awkward on/Near Campus, Will It Get Better?",https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gfqp9t/feel_uncomfortable_and_awkward_onnear_campus_will/,24,31,2024-10-30 16:28:49,"edit: I've found a new therapist

About 2 weeks ago I got my acceptance letter to transfer to LSA (CS) for winter 2025. Honestly I was pretty surprised and was expecting rejection, but no, got it on the first try ig. consider this my attentionwhoring ""omg i got in"" post.

Ive lived in Ann Arbor my whole life. Im not going to list every meaningless connection i have with the city university or downtown area. But I went to AAPS then WCC and I work downtown. For as long as i remember ive treated the campuses and downtown areas surrounding the central campus as an off limits area (like north of hill st, east of blake, south of plymouth), needing my friends and family to basically chaperone me to feel somewhat comfortable. Even then a lot of them often wanted to avoid it too. Like I remember when i was like 14 and with my friend, and she said we shouldnt hang out on game days to like avoid harassment.

When i was like 10 my mom dragged me to the union building (or some place similar) a few times for some social events she was participating in. I remember i would cry and refuse to enter because i was wearing my backpack and felt like i was imitating the students. I knew it was illogical to feel that way but i just couldnt stop feeling self conscious about looking like i was pretending to be someone i wasnt.

Yesterday my mom took me on a tour of central campus because she went in the early 90s and wants me to be more comfortable with navigating. Even though i know the area better, work nearby, am the same age as many of the students, and (i think) am technically a student now, it was still incredibly uncomfortable walking around like the diag or going into one of the libraries. I mean it was almost night and there were barely any students out but I constantly just wanted to run away and not been seen and sometimes getting kinda teary and tense.

will this get better? I want to tell myself that once i actually do orientation or enroll in classes or starting going to classes or whatever that ill finally be more comfortable being there. But will i? I dont really ever see anyone else feel this way. Few months ago some boy visiting from MSU took me on a date to the arb (bad idea i know) and other areas downtown and he didnt seem to mind any of it like it was natural to him. Even that friend i had when i 14 that didnt want to go during game days would still drag me around downtown and she was way more comfortable than any girl that age really ought to be, like. Idk when i was a kid i just thought most students were like just older versions of me and my classmates but now im actually college aged and witnessing some of the behaviors of university students (particularly men tbh) i realize that a lot of uni students are kinda terrifying me.

I really need friends and socialization and im scared that ill miss out on opportunities to make them if im always too scared to get near any of them. I really want to get started on getting involved socially asap because i am just incredibly lonely and im not sure what im able to even do rn.

I’m a freshman at U-M and currently in the middle of my first semester. I am currently taking an architecture class because I came into freshman year thinking I would most likely pursue architecture, instead of psychology (I was deciding between the two majors) 

However, not only am I 100% sure that I’m not pursuing a major in architecture, I absolutely hate the architecture class that I’m in. Not only is it miserable for me, but I currently have a C in the class. I cannot stand the three hour lectures and I don’t have the motivation to complete the assignments. I am currently deciding if I should drop the class, or take it as a pass/fail option. 

For context, I want to go to a prestigious college, preferably an Ivy League, for a PhD or graduate program in psychology. Additionally, if I drop this class, I would have 13 credits for this semester. My question is, which option would be better for me given my current situation. Also, which option would look worse to grad schools/phd programs. How badly will my chances of getting into top grad/phd programs be affected with both options?

Any insight would be appreciated. Thank you! "

We are a team of University of Michigan researchers who study dating and relationships. We’re launching a dating app at U-M in Winter 2025 and we are inviting a small group of students to get an inside look and beta test this brand-new app this fall.

[Revel](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/revel/) is a free dating app built by Michigan scientists for Michigan students. Revel isn’t just about swipes or matches, although there is that too. It’s a way to discover new connections on campus while learning more about your motivations and habits. 

**Why Revel?** 

**Campus Connections:** Ever wanted to expand your pool of dating options? Only see a pool of other Michigan students? Or discover more Wolverines who share your passions and interests? Revel connects you with people from all over campus. 

**Exclusive to U-M Students:** This app is exclusive to U-M! No other university has a dating app built by relationship scientists just for their students. Only registered undergraduates and graduates at U-M, who are 18 years or older, can use Revel. 

**For Science, Not Profit:** Revel was developed for science. We want to answer questions about what makes people click and use that knowledge to improve online dating experiences. Always free, no ads.  

**Insights for Curious Minds:** Ever wonder why you “click” with some people but not others? Or what qualities make a relationship truly happy? Revel picks up on the stuff you miss and delivers it back to you in personalized insights. 

**Why be a Revel Beta Tester?** Not only will you get a sneak peek at the app before it goes live and an early chance to use it, you’ll also have the option to give us feedback that will shape Revel’s development and priorities for the future.  

**Ready to test out Revel and help make it a success?** Join our beta testing list[ here](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/revel/beta-tester/). We’ll send out invitations throughout the fall semester.

 

For more information, visit [www.reveldating.com](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/revel/) or email reveldating@umich.edu with any questions.

Thank you for considering Revel. We hope you’ll join us!

I’m **Leslie Wilkins**, a proud U of M graduate (’94, Music and Psychology) and current candidate for the Ann Arbor School Board. As a longtime AAPS parent, I’ve spent many years advocating for students, families, and teachers, and now I’m running to bring fiscal accountability and transparency to our public schools. I want to explain why this school board election matters to **you** as UM students.

**1. Public Schools Shape Better Citizens for Democracy**  
A strong public school system is the foundation of a healthy democracy. Ann Arbor’s schools educate future leaders who will uphold democratic values and protect the rights of those who have been historically excluded. By ensuring that our schools provide equitable, high-quality education, we foster responsible citizens who are better equipped to protect the values we all cherish.

**2. Strong Public Schools = A Thriving Ann Arbor**  
Great schools don’t just benefit K-12 students—they attract investment, strengthen the local economy, and make Ann Arbor a more desirable place to live. That translates to more opportunities for jobs, research, art, and collaboration for everyone, including UM students and graduates who stay in the area after completing their degrees.

**Addressing the AAPS Budget Crisis**  
Right now, the Ann Arbor Public Schools are facing a serious budget deficit, and we need new leadership to tackle it. As a business school graduate with financial analyst experience, I’m committed to providing stronger financial oversight to avoid overspending and make sure we’re investing wisely in students’ futures. My focus is on transparency, accountability, and ensuring that our schools are run with care and diligence.

I’d love to hear from you! If you have any thoughts, concerns, or questions about my candidacy and how the Ann Arbor School Board impacts you as students, please feel free to share them below!

Go Blue!

“To resign is to take responsibility for one’s actions. Ever since SHUT IT DOWN took power in CSG in April 2024, its leadership has mixed incompetency with actual malice toward the U-M community.”

“Chowdhury and Atkinson rarely provide reports to the Assembly and skip their long-sought opportunities to address the Board of Regents. They have put on zero events for the student body. They have intentionally not filed CSG as a Sponsored Student Organization, jeopardizing its potential to disburse student funds and use U-M spaces in the future. They rarely meet with administrators and don’t let the Assembly know when they do so.”

As for the Op-Ed, I fact-checked the above statements and confirmed with multiple sources that, as far as they have seen and the paper records kept by CSG, the previous paragraph (other than the outright opinions expressed about event frequency) is 100% accurate. The information surrounding the ‘07 and ‘20 incidents were also well-sourced.

The Michigan Review still has yet to receive video from the October 8th meeting but, per source, those investigations are ongoing.

Also, does only 1 person's name go on the bills & rent, and if so, does that cause complications with school paperwork (proof of residency and all that)?

I would appreciate any advice from people who have gone through this already.

A little confused about the physics sequence and some of the math requirements,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1gdt2ki/a_little_confused_about_the_physics_sequence_and/,0,1,2024-10-28 03:38:05,"I'm currently applying to be an Physics+Math double major and I'm quite confused about what exactly I need to do for the physics major:

I see AP Physics C tests me out of 139 and 239...but what exactly are those? They're not on the course catalog, do I still have to take 140 and 240? Can I test out of those? I've self-studied physics on my own well beyond the level of AP Physics, so I'd really rather not have to spend my first year learning nothing, since it seems like there's not really any classes I can take until I take those except 351, which seems more like a math course than a physics course.

Also, a lot of the physics courses require one of the differential equations courses, and since I'm going to also be majoring in math, and I have a pretty good background in math, I feel like it would be most logical for me to take 316. Though I'm planning to do (assuming I get in) 295-296-395-396, and it seems like 316 is sort of disjoint from that? Like in the list of prereqs for 316 it doesn't even mention the possibility of taking it after 295? It also says you need 217 to take 316, which is covered by 296+395, but that means I wouldn't fulfill the 217 requirement until after sophomore year semester 1, so should I take 217 along with 295 first semester frosh year to get it out of the way even though its essentially redundant? Also, I'm currently self-studying linear algebra using Axler's book, so knowledge-wise I'll have the prereqs to 316, can I just take it even though I don't technically have the prereqs?

Sorry if this whole thing is worded very confusingly"

I am currently applying to PhD programs and Michigan is both my top choice and the program where it seems most likely I will be accepted into. Everything seems to be aligning, and I am stoked at the (increasingly real) idea of getting my PhD from Michigan!

However, I am nonbinary and one of the main concerns I have in grad school is finally getting access to insurance that can make getting gender affirming care a tangible possibility. Specifically, I am planning to get top surgery (double mastectomy), and potentially a hysterectomy and go on low-dose T. 

This may be a long shot, but I was wondering if anyone on this sub has first-hand experience in receiving this type of care while being insured by GradCare? For instance, the ease of finding a provider in network, satisfaction of results, out of pocket cost, overall vibe of providers, etc. I have read all of the information available on the website, but I don’t want to commit to a place for the next 5-7 years of my life if the care I am needing will be hard to receive through their insurance. I feel like the best way to ensure that I will get what I need is by asking people with first hand experience. Obviously, if I get accepted and am able to go to the admitted students day, I will ask more pointed questions and try to meet with someone who can walk me through the insurance side of things, but I just want to get other perspectives as well since this is a huge thing to take into consideration.

i hate it here ,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1galk0r/i_hate_it_here/,241,134,2024-10-23 21:13:19,"hiii, posting here is very new to me but i just have to let my frustrations out somewhere. that being said, sorry if this is meant to be posted someplace else, i really am clueless!! 

i’m a first gen freshman here and i came from a pretty weak high school where i didn’t learn a lot of key concepts for subjects i thought i was really strong in. like a lot of people, i never had to study or really try in hs, so i came into college thinking i could handle 18 credits and i was SO wrong. i’ve been spending 6+ hours minimum a day every day of the week on homework / studying and i feel like nothings coming out of it. my first chem midterm i studied for days and was so proud of myself, but i still got a bit below average while almost everyone i know scored in the high 90s, so that high was short lived. im super stressed about doing well in my classes because i won a $20k scholarship, but i lose it if my gpa drops below a 3.0. no matter how hard i work, i don’t feel like im good enough at anything, and i’m scared im setting myself up for failure. 

because of how much im studying, ive had such little time to try to socialize, so ive made genuinely 0 friends here. there’s a group i go to parties / games with sometimes, but they’re all really close and im just kinda There and ive realized lately they seem to intentionally leave me out of things (ex ill text asking when we’re leaving and they’ll all leave me on seen and leave together without me- things like this have happened 10+ times at LEAST and it’s only been 2 months, they also all openly text in a separate groupchat that i’m not in right in front of me and once even left me alone drunk at 2am on a street id never been on). i have no clue how to balance my academic / social life when im struggling so much in my classes and have no real friends in the first place. the only person i really talk to is my mom and i refuse to tell her im struggling because she was so hurt and worried when i first told her i haven’t met anyone great yet two months ago- if she knew the same now, it’d break her heart. 

im just so miserable here and i dont even know where to go or who to talk to about any of it. i dont know how to go about attending office hours or talking to a counselor (?) or anything like that and at this point it feels too late to ask. i just feel like i have no redeeming qualities anymore and it’s really tearing me apart- i don’t feel smart anymore, im barely managing to take care of myself, i don’t have anyone here to spend time with, the whole nine yards. 

in hs i was super extroverted and optimistic, but a lot of stuff happened my junior and senior year that caused me to really dial it down and i just feel like a shell of my old self. the one thing i was sure of coming into this was that i wanted to go premed, but considering i can’t even handle a day of introductory chem without crying, that’s a no go now. im pretty decent with english (ignore my grammar etc here lol) and that’s about all, but i don’t know what i could even do with that, or if i enjoy it enough to pursue it. 

i’m just at a loss in all aspects of my life right now and i have no clue how to help myself. i know everyone struggles, but i don’t think ive met anyone who feels as stupid and invalid and alone as i do. i think ill take less credits next semester, but idk what classes to take considering im clueless on what i want to do now. that being said, i also have to get a job next semester, so idek if a few credits less will save me time. i know things won’t just magically fix themselves, though, so i could really use some advice from you guys 

tldr i feel like im the dumbest, loneliest person in every room im in. i have no goals/aspirations/friends/positive things to say about myself anymore and its really taking a toll on me, but i also have no idea where to go. any advice on any aspect of anything at all is appreciated 

***HIIII i’ve been reading every reply as they come in and you’ve all made my night/week/month/semester/year/undergrad/college experience- i appreciate every little piece of advice and all of the words of encouragement and i will absolutely be trying to put some of this into use, thank you all so so much!!! as implied i don’t have a lot of free time on my hands lol so i may take a hot minute to get back to most of you, but i appreciate it all so much!! thank you guys again for all of your wisdom:)"

If it's relevant, I've searched my university database and found that I've taken the equivalent of ACC471 and found it really fun and not too difficult (however, even though its accredited, it might not be the similar?).

I would love you to recommend classes for me to take or advise me to avoid. It doesn't necessarily have to be related to my major could also be psychology, international business Chinese, Business Law, etc. It'll be amazing if you could share particular classes that you have really enjoyed or that you think would be valuable to learn.

I am a 23-year old, graduated from undergrad with a degree in information management systems & business analytics & philosophy. Been working about a year, first at a startup promoting financial equity and now at a Big4 doing some IT consulting + sustainability work. 

I have always loved writing and am passionate about it - have written multiple anthologies of short stories, nothing published. Have attended various conferences and won scholarships to attend through submitting my writing, post-college. I want to apply to UMich’s MFA program in creative writing, but not sure how to go about “letters of recommendation” in the admissions process. My undergrad degree was not related to writing, so those professors really can’t speak to my writing ability. I have a couple high school teachers that I’m still in contact with who have more exposure to my writing, and maybe a few folks from conferences (but those are usually very brief, e.g. a weekend.) 

My question is: What should I do to strengthen my case about wanting to pursue an MFA to folks who can write me a letter of recommendation? Is there a path I can take to apply to an MFA in Creative Writing if I majored in a completely unrelated area?

I was recently admitted to the LSA college as an OOS transfer student. I know Michigan is stingy about credits it takes, but do really only 6 of my credits transfer into Michigan as credits that actually count towards the requirement of my degree, rather than empty electives?

It seems pretty freakin hard to socialize regularly at Umich which is strange, perhapse I'm doing this wrong. **I joined more than 12 clubs but two months in it still feels like I get barely any socialization outside of doing hw in office hours !!!** It is so fkin depressing working my ass of during the weekdays to get all my hw done then getting home and realizing I have literally nothing to look forward to. The weekends... dam I don't even want to talk about the weekends. 

**Most clubs only meet bi-weekly**, some clubs never reached back, and often times bi-weekly clubs get canceled at the last minute turning bi-weekly meets to monthly meets, which is F&@king ridiculous!

Idk about you but I kinda doubt it's reasonable for someone to make friends by meeting once a month. Especially if those clubs arn't even social meets!

So does anyone have a big list of recommendations for clubs that consistently meet multiple times a week, especially on the weekends???? Thanks!

**Proof of Effort (and probably a severly factually incorrect rant of clubs I've tried to join):**  
- **V1 michigan** -> First off, every meeting is basically just listening to a lecture or doing private work. Second, ship it sundays apparently isn't every sunday, more like every month. WTF?  
- **ENTR Power Hour** -> This one's pretty dope actually, unfortunate it meets once every two weeks  
- **Marketing Michigan** -> Rejected, ????  
- **Chinese Entreprenurship Club** -> Rejected ?????? Probably my fault, made too many guomingdang jokes in the application  
- **College Dems** -> Not bad, not great, meets semi-regularly which is great, but still don't understand what the exact schedule is besides getting random notifiactions in my gmail the day of that something is going down. Then these turn out to just be lecutures given by politicians? How da fuck am I supposed to socialize? Though the door knocking for Kamala harris ain't to bad.  
- **College Republicans** -> Honestly, this one's not to bad either, a little more interesting than the college dem's bc pretty much every meeting I know of is a discussion on differing ideas. Just got no freakin idea when they are meeting.   
- **M-Fly** -> Too many guys in a tiny room without ac. How da fuck is it always 20 degrees warmer in the room than surrounding areas? Have CS people just adapted to metabolize calories at a faster rate than normal people to compensate for the lack of exercise???? Jkjk, main reason I quit was just too many guys no girls  
- **Panel For your thoughts** -> Signed up on Maize pages, turns out hasn't been active since March 2024  
- **PolySci club** -> Last meeting was in late september, which was the only meeting this year so far from looks of it  
- **Umich Rifle club** -> Litterally havent heard a word back since August 28th. No insta posts either, seemed cool tho  
- **Squirrel Club** -> This one's my fault, they meet once a week, I just keep missing the meetings  
- **Mbuild** -> No word back

TL;DR interested in DS/ML, best CSE stats class to take??

Freshman CSE here looking at Stats options for the Winter 2025 semester.

The CSE advising guide lists off a plethora of classes that satisfy the stats requirement (i.e. STATS 250/280, STATS 412, DATASCI 101, STATS 426, EECS 301, etc.) I don't want to take a class just to satisfy the grad requirements, but since stats is the core of data science and ML, which of the following listed above would be the best to take to get a mathematically-rigorous and application-enlightening view on stats. 

I heard STATS 250 is just a rehash of AP stats (or maybe the other way around?) and have heard mixed feelings on STATS 412 (given Fink as the professor).

I'm leaning towards EECS 301 but heard (granted from Reddit threads like 8 years old) that it's damn hard. Granted, damn hard is ok so long as it's a useful class in the grand scheme of things.

Oh also, the schedule I have penciled in for next semester:
- EECS 281
- ROB 204 (I want to explore robotics and it's a flex tech so I'll take those)
- Language class (language minor)
- Stats class

I've been thinking about options like marketing, which seems like it could tap into my creativity, which I would like considering that the Nursing program doesn't really do that. Something that triggered this feeling is that I just recently watched my mom go through hospice care, and It was really tough and it made me question if I could handle being a nurse. I know treating patients might be different from my experience with my mom, but I can't shake the feeling that this path might not be for me.

All of my classes have been great, except for bio 172. Due to some personal reasons, i wasn’t able to properly study for the first exam and tanked it, which is quite obvious. But I made it my goal to study hard for the next exam. I know Bio 172 is a difficult class, esp when avg for exams is 73%. I studied really hard for exam 2, understood the content, and did well on the problem roulette questions. I took the practice exam without a cheat sheet and notes and got a 57%. After leaving exam 2, with 10 questions I wasn’t sure about, I feel that maybe I’m just not meant to be a doctor. I know there’s people that get A’s in this class, why can’t I just also do that. I know that I understand this material because while studying, I was explaining the slides to myself on a white board. I spoke to chapman and he himself said that He makes the exams extremely difficult on purpose, so his students can do well on other courses. But Like if the exam questions are like this for the MCAT, maybe I’m just not meant for it. Maybe I should consider a different career, even though I want to be a surgeon so bad one day. I work as a MA and I’ve shadowed a surgeon, and I absolutely love doing hands on procedures and one day doing surgical procedures. But is this class really going to be the reason I don’t get into medical school. But if I can’t even do well on a basic bio class, I should just leave the pre med route. Idk.

Hamlin pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of animal cruelty brought against him and four of his fraternity brothers in 1980, when he was an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. The charge was brought against Hamlin under a local Ann Arbor ordinance. All five members of Alpha Delta Phi were later expelled from the fraternity.

The details of the case, described in local media reports at the time, are gruesome. The house cat was captured, its paws were cut off, and was then strung up and set on fire. The killing, which occurred in December 1979, was allegedly prompted by anger that the cat was not using its litterbox.”"

October CSG News and SHUT IT DOWN Fallout,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1g1ymxv/october_csg_news_and_shut_it_down_fallout/,134,112,2024-10-12 12:05:10,"TL:DR: Nearly Half of CSG Members call for SHUT IT DOWN Pres/VP to resign, University investigation, criminal allegations and November Elections (20th-21st).

Brief recap of the already public discussion after [10/08 Student Government meeting](https://www.michigandaily.com/news/student-government/csg-passes-wolverines-budget-act-fails-to-pass-rebuilding-education-in-gaza-act/)**:**

* Before the [10/08 CSG meeting](https://www.csg.umich.edu/post/recap-for-assembly-meeting-october-8-2024) on North Campus, the SHUT IT DOWN (SID) Instagram account, repeatedly used by President Alifa Chowdury and the SID campaign, [urged their supporters](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAygxeZRcyJ/) to ""Pack CSG,"" which it has done on multiple occasions before. During the meeting, sources say that multiple individual members were named in the protest group chats, for those who allegedly voted against their [Rebuilding Education in Gaza petition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fw7CO3W1KGqC_2C4yn_CgLXCQPCajUt0XupQ3tIz4TQ/edit) (vote was by secret ballot).
* After the meeting ended with a de facto end to the budget wars, with the [Wolverines Budget Act](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KdNRhuAlhakygecsZfcPMvmmYAKy0mgUdHgxeMFxShY/edit) succeeding, the meeting immediately broke out into chaos, with multiple members reporting threats, one non-member allegedly being spit on, and multiple members locking themselves in a room after being pursued by protestors. Some of the reported intimidation that can be only slightly heard on camera included ""Fuck CSG, this is not democracy"" after a democratic vote confirmed by the University's software confirmed the results of the vote. No other business was discussed after immediate evacuation (including two [Disability Advocacy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GpU0rSBCtjXkWmwNbE1-Lt4PnachvXMeZqPw_tAX5Ss/edit) bills, [Trans protection act](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17abxS-Tb6k7pQJNklJadKNnNAm7ZQx4xLDVBuwHs_eY/edit), the creation of a [Psychology Minor in LSA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16d78nWx4RX3EUJ_HlbeeDTjW2QGiqHPI4xVPsx9gZMM/edit), and other minor bills.) **\*\*NOTE: Some of these bills are soliciting endorsements and are in Comment Mode if you would like to add your name\*\***
* In the early hours of 10/09, [CSG's Instagram account reposted](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1fzwpo3/did_one_of_safes_admins_accidentally_post_on_the/) the same post that was cross-posted by the SID, Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), Tahrir Coalition, and Students Allied for Freedom & Equality (SAFE). Sources familiar with the matter confirmed that members of CSG mass-reported the account after discovering that the login information was changed by President Alifa Chowdury, who tacitly confirmed in the comment section that she was responsible for the post. The account was then deactivated for most of the day before being reinstated with the post, with multiple CSG members from both CSG factions publicly criticizing each other and protest leaders. Both the CSG and SID accounts appear to have deleted multiple comments that were critical of the post and SID's actions, including the deletion of multiple active CSG members. As of 10/12, the post has been removed and the CSG account is active.

**News:**

* The [active Reddit poll (PLEASE VOTE if you haven't already)](https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1g0gk8a/poll_do_you_approve_of_the_shut_it_down/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) conducted has a current approval rate for the SHUT IT DOWN administration of **15.66% approval rating** (not including 108 ""No Opinion"" responses) from the community. By comparison, SID's executive branch was elected with \~47% of the vote after a competitive ""Ranked Choice"" vote (with their Assembly taking 22/45 seats). LIVE UPDATES.
* One additional SID Representative has resigned since the 10/08 meeting, reducing the SID membership to 10 + Executive Branch (and 5 non-SID members who voted on their side for their promoted petition).
* During the closed debate, a member of CSG allegedly on the SID side recorded and distributed information that was privileged, which is a violation of CSG rules if true. The vast majority of CSG, including SID members, voted to debate privately for around a half hour. Sources cannot confirm which individual distributed the information, only that information was distributed in violation of CSG rules.
* On 10/10, [SID amended its Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DA5wT_qRfHQ/) that called Student Org supporters ""CSG Zionists."" Multiple inaccurate and outright false claims were made in the caption, including referring to secret ballot as a ""closed vote,"" falsely saying ""Zionists refused to allow people to speak during public comment,"" and ""cut off microphones mid-speech."" (The secret ballot was not a ""closed vote"" and had been used numerous times throughout the year, with the vast majority of SID members repeatedly consenting to the voting method. As for community members not being allowed to speak, this is an outright falsehood, as CSG let over 30 speakers voice their perspectives and opinions on the bills for nearly 2 straight hours. And for cutting off microphones mid-speech, this is built-in to the procedure of CSG; each member has 3 minutes to speak and an opportunity to answer questions from members on a per-question basis. No unusual tactics were used to silence speakers and, on many occasions, CSG members make motions to extend time for speakers, typically for prepared presentations). The post ended by alluding to the ""fight being far from over"" with ""statement and updates coming soon.""
* Multiple sources familiar with the matter have indicated that the University will be stepping in on some level to intervene in the situation. It is unclear what type of role they will have in CSG going forward and following an independent investigation into the allegations that occurred in and around the 10/08 meeting.
* Multiple CSG members and non-members in attendance of the 10/08 meeting (all not affiliated with SID) have sought counseling and other mental health treatments for what they allegedly experienced. As of 10/12, not one public nor private statement from SID or its membership has acknowledged the veracity allegations in a direct capacity.
* 17 Current Members of CSG and 38 Total Representatives (Past/Present/Non-CSG from the last decade) have signed\* [a statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HBEvxK4LgxNBiWmuPh6v4gf_2SeDNBvqxxg30o_ogPI/edit?usp=sharing) that calls for the immediate resignation of SID President Chowdury and Vice President Atkinson (including one member appointed by SID) The statement also alleged that multiple members were told ""We know where you \[specific representatives\] live,"" ""We'll be seeing you after class,"" and their ""day of atonement was near,"" on top of other curses, names, and other forms of jeers. Lastly, the statement encourages participation in the November special elections, which are set to take place the week before Thanksgiving on [vote.umich.edu](http://vote.umich.edu/).
* The [special elections](https://www.csg.umich.edu/elections) are officially going to have the most seats up for grabs in the history of Student Government, with 9 LSA, 4 Rackham seats, 1 Ross, and the single-seat Social Work and Dentistry up for election (on top of the UMPD bi-annual race and the few Constitutional amendments expected to reach the ballot. **16/45 Assembly Seats+1**) It is highly possible that these numbers will grow if more members resign or face recall and, as of today, no one has applied to fill the Dentistry vacancy through the DSG (Dental Student Government). The filing period has opened for all of these seats, with a handful of candidates already filing.
* Per source, the Ross vacancy will be filled via BBA Council (like a smaller CSG specifically for Ross undergraduate students) appointee at the 10/22 CSG meeting. There are no meeting nor committees during Fall Break. This seat, like all filled vacancies, will still be subject to the November special election. It is unclear how the new appointee will vote, although the source familiar with the matter indicates the appointee has institutional backing from the ""Saving CSG"" crowd.
* The special election filing deadline is 10/30. Follow the instructions on the CSG website if you are interested in learning more."

I have been having some issues with her since we moved in. Keep in mind that this is a partial vent so not all of these problems are actionable and some are just annoying. Long rant incoming.

The first week, she basically didn't really want to make friends at all because she found out her acquaintance from high school lived down the hall. Her acquaintance was nice but very quiet and the acquaintance's roommate seemed nice but was also kind of harsh and genuinely mean. I said we should go meet people so we went to a welcome week event. I met people and kept hanging out with them and became a small friend group while she stuck with her one acquaintance and her friend from high school's ex who lived across the hall. All good. Roommates can have different friends. Not a crime.

But even at this point when I was still friends with my roommate, she was kind of mean about my friends. She kind of insinuated that two of them were trashy because they seemed like the kind of people to go to frat parties (which in my opinion isn't some kind of sin and they don't even go to frat parties so it doesn't matter?).

During this point, she tells me a lot of personal stuff and gets really upset about this and I try and comfort her as best as I can because she genuinely seems like a nice person.

Continuing on, this first week she meets a guy who flirts with her and she likes him. This leads to her leaving her friends alone in our dorm room with the door open while she goes away for an hour with this guy and I had been out the whole day. They're still in there when I want to go to bed at 10:45pm and I ask if she can keep people out after 9pm-ish. She says yes.

Then I get COVID and am home for a week. I come back and she tells me first that she made out with the guy in our room and then eventually it comes out that they are friends with benefits and had sex when I wasn't there. It really weirds me out but I kind of froze up and just didn't say anything about that. The weeks go on and she has an on and off relationship with this guy and tells me about it late at night so I stay up talking to her about it and feel sick in the morning because I'm not sleeping but she seems nice and I want to be nice. Then he is mean to her and she comes back crying and I comfort her and don't sleep that night either.

We now have completely separate friend groups and I notice now that she and her friends treat me weird. They talk to me as if I'm stupid and vapid, and she makes slightly rude comments about my friends if I mention things that they do (like going to the frats on the weekends). I try to be as friendly as I can anyways because I could be imagining things.

I go home every weekend. I come back to find that she's used my fan over the weekend without asking and used my paper towels and left her friend's dirty dishes on my desk. But she is a nice girl and I'm sure there are things about me that she doesn't like and keeps to herself.

Then the worst thing out of everything happens. I am working on an essay and exhausted because I’ve had three back to back important essays over the past few weeks and have finally hit a writer’s block wall. I come back to the room after crying and she asks what is wrong. I say something along the lines of “I’m so tired, I wish I had a longer break after IB because I feel like we barely got time off and I’m still exhausted” because I really did work hard at school and I really am tired. She tells me something along the lines of how it’s a privilege to be here and I brush it off as her trying to be comforting and say that I need to pee and will be right back. I come back to the room and I walk in on her friend saying “You can’t come to college with that kind of mindset”, clearly talking about me. It’s 12am and I just hold back tears and sleep in my friend’s room for the rest of the week.

Since then, I’ve been angry. How many sleepless nights did I waste? How many times did I hold my tongue about things she did? And she just turned around and clearly talked shit about me with her friend when I was at my lowest.

She apparently wants to be an RA so now all of a sudden she wants a roommate contract. I told her I didn’t want to talk about it until I finished a midterm I was stressed about. She tracked me down to my friend’s room and insisted that I talked to her about it last night and I was just so tired that I let her push me over once again and signed a contract I didn’t actually agree to. The whole conversation really bothered me, especially the way she acted as if she was allowing me to stay at my friends’ room overnight sometimes when the only reason I do it is because she makes me so miserable that I can’t fall asleep in our room.

But I’m done. I’m exhausted and tired and she causes me so much extra stress when I really do have a good life at this college. I’ve been miserable for months and it’s all because of the weight of her behavior on me because I’m too much of a pushover to bring it up. But I’m done. I filed a room switch request and I am going to text her tonight and tell her that I did not agree with what she put in the roommate contract and will not talk to her about it until after my midterm. I’ve been half living out of my friends’ room and will maybe keep doing that until the midterm is done and then sit down and at least hammer out a roommate contract that I can live under until I get a room switch. My parents don’t know about the room switch because they say my roommate is a nice girl despite all of this. I know it could be worse, but the relief completely outweighed the guilt I felt filling out that room swap form.

Does anyone have any other advice beyond this? I have already talked to the RA about this but she likes my roommate better and generally takes her side no matter what."

POLL: Do you approve of the SHUT IT DOWN administration?,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1g0gk8a/poll_do_you_approve_of_the_shut_it_down/,0,19,2024-10-10 11:25:56,"BACKGROUND: SHUT IT DOWN was elected in the Winter 2024 semester and has blocked 2 different budgets, followed by a failed attempt to block a third budget this last Tuesday.  They began the semester by de facto blocking all legislation by staging walkouts of multiple CSG meetings.

The president of CSG has left numerous seats in the Executive cabinet vacant, along with every ex-officio position in the Assembly (including representatives for transfer and international students). Additionally, the SHUT IT DOWN executive has published about half the typical “Executive Reports” which are to be delivered at each public meeting, on their progress of their actions.

SHUT IT DOWN has co-sponsored a few acts, all entirely at the Assembly level including reforms to various rules and declaratory resolutions that condemn specific actions but do not have subsequent operative clauses to make changes. Some others include Disability advocacy, an examination of how student org funding is utilized, and condemnation of police brutality on campus.

Over half of SHUT IT DOWN’s members have either resigned or been recalled due to excessive absences at CSG meetings, including the former Ethics Chair.

The SHUT IT DOWN administration has used Instagram to call for its supporters to “pack CSG” at multiple meetings, including the most recent CSG meeting where multiple CSG members reported being threatened on campus, followed outside of the meeting, and one non-member being allegedly spat on. Every SHUT IT DOWN member I spoke to denies these accusations.

For more information about CSG and the legislation that has passed this year, please visit https://csg.umich.edu/

FYI: I tried to stick to the facts and on the record allegations by CSG members. If there is anything you believe I am missing, as long as it is supported by the facts, please let me know and I will edit the post. I am not trying to be excessively negative, just documenting the reality of the last 7 months in CSG, which I have covered extensively here. Also, if you are directly involved as a speaker, CSG member or former CSG member, please let me know. I’d really love to put people’s firsthand knowledge on display to increase the transparency of what is currently occurring in CSG.

Also, please do not engage in ad hominem attacks in these comments. Attack the issues, the platforms and do so with critical thought. Please downvote anyone just regurgitating tired talking points and generally being unproductive. Thank you.

EDIT: It appears the CSG website is not fully up-to-date on the legislation tab. So far this year, over 2 dozen bills have passed, half of them without any operative clauses that make changes (either communication or declaratory resolutions only). They are listed on the agendas but the Master List on the “legislation” tab is outdated.

It's nice to know this subreddit exists. I guess I just needed to get this out so someone here knew there was a student in their ranks who is struggling and at the end of a long and very tired rope. A lot of you have probably seen me walk by you and don't even know it. I'm all over North and Central Campus.

I am a transfer student and in several organizations. I also work at a large company when I'm not here. I'm an older student. Every day, every week, I am surrounded by coeds and colleagues who are almost half my age. People my age seem to be in all the areas I'm not, and vice versa.

Never in my life have I felt more alone than I do now. How can I be surrounded by thousands of other people and feel like I don't belong at all, like I have no place anywhere in my life? I feel so isolated, so cut off from everything and everyone. Even my therapist has nothing to say except offering her condolences for feeling so disconnected from everyone. She suggested finding a support group outside of the university that has people my age, but where is the time for that? Life is a packed schedule of lean nonsense with little fat to clip.

Where did I go so wrong, to be at school so much later in life, to be working at a company full of people younger than me, and unable to find anyone I can relate to? How did such a seemingly-happy childhood devolve into an existence where if I were to disappear tomorrow, not a soul would notice?

I come home to a tiny apartment and try to pretend it's just another fine day in the books, but there comes the inevitable staring at the wall, feeling like I'm looking into the void of my soul that is missing such a fundamental connection and purpose in life. Not even a friend. No family to call. Just another day to come of walking as another face in the crowd, on the outside looking in.

For any of you who are quietly struggling on campus, you're not alone. I'm right there with you and struggling to keep on keeping on. 

Thanks for reading. Surely I'll be flamed for exposing my vulnerability; as such, I'm sorry to trouble you with my woes, whomever you are."

The meeting starts Tuesday at 7:30 PM!
Numerous members of the community are slated to speak on these issues. Both are set to be voted on towards the end of the meeting tomorrow night!

There is still a chance that both fail and are sent to the ballot box. Another outcome is that the Rebuilding Education in Gaza Act is ruled out of order per appropriations considerations in the All-Campus Constitution (see csg.umich.edu).  

A ton of other pieces of legislation are set for introduction, including multiple Disability Advocacy acts, a Scholarship Study Act, a Trans Protection act, and a bill to initiate the creation of a Psychology Minor in LSA.

LING 137,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1fxviqm/ling_137/,45,7,2024-10-07 00:49:29,"Warning because I’m about to be a mega hater but I have talked to many other people in the class this semester who all also feel this way. I have never seen a worse organized class before. I am a computer science major but have taken 2 linguistics classes in the past because I find the area of study interesting. The subject of LING 137 is pretty interesting, it’s basically about language standardization, and how no way of speaking is truly “incorrect”, and who decides what language is considered “correct” and “incorrect”.

The class is organized to be basically a “choose your adventure” kind of thing, where there’s a tonnnn of different assignments you can choose to do, and no late assignments are accepted since there's so many to choose from. However, in order to get an A in the class, you need to reach 1.2 MILLION POINTS. 1.2 million???? Out of a possible 2.9 million points. This grading scale is so absurd that the professor has to spend the first 15 minutes of each 50-minute lecture re-explaining how the grading system works. The smallest assignments are worth 5,000 points which is also ridiculous, I just don’t understand why everything needs to be in the thousands because it makes it feel way more overwhelming. We use GradeCraft so that you can hypothetically plot out which assignments you want to do, but there are so many goddamn assignments, most of which are 50,000 points or less, so it's just ridiculous to expect each student to go through and spend like an hour plotting this out. Plus, they grade the assignments really hard so you can’t actually plan out what you’ll need to do. Many of the assignments are multiple page essays, which is usually not expected of a 100-level linguistics course. In my other 100-level linguistics course, we had a simple worksheet to do every week or every other week. The instructors have to know that the vast majority of the people in this class were planning on taking it as an easy class to balance out their schedule.

I understand the idea behind this grading system - it’s to allow students wiggle room if they get sick or have a busy week so they don’t have to do assignments that week, and so students can pick and choose which assignments are actually interesting to them. But since there are so many assignments, many of them barely make sense. The past several weeks, 35 minutes out of the 50-minute discussion have been spent going over the instructions for upcoming assignments because the entire class is so confused over them. It really sucks because the course content is actually pretty interesting, but we move sooooo slowly through the lecture everyday, and it feels like we’re barely learning anything new. I could go on and on about all the things that frustrate me about this class, but I just needed to get this off my chest because every time I go to do an assignment for the class, I get so annoyed. I'm guessing that I and most people will still end up with an A in the class, but there is just so much unnecessary stress and confusion for a grading system that the class hates."

I have a spreadsheet of all the meal plans/dorm choices/whatever else I need to pick out for individual universities picked out so that I just have to fill out the paperwork and I’ll be done.

Into the question. What is the general opinion on the Betsy Barbour dorm? It’s in central campus, which I like, and it’s an all women’s dorm, which I feel most comfortable with. I’m just wondering in if there are some more niche things that only someone who lives on campus would know? Maybe about the general environment or quality of living there.

This class is unengaging for all students, all students in my lab session finish in the first thirty minutes and sit around wasting time. Lectures are too slow and repetitive. The amount of learning I gained from this class is so absurdly little, and this class does not even possess value as an ""easy class"" due to the amount of attendance required.
