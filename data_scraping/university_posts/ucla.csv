I could tell you were quite enjoying your meal, but... do you REALLY have to eat it in the study room while people are trying to actually get work done in here? If this slurping and slopping noises weren't enough, you turned on your phone and began watching annoying anime at FULL VOLUME. To top it off you didn't even throw away your Panda trash when you were done so there's still a plastic bag and plate of leftovers on the table.

My GPA is too high. Every time I mention it to a prof, they faint from hearing it. MyUcla crashes every time I load my transcript.

Then there's my body. I'm too handsome. I'm forced to wear full clothing and shades all the time becacuse whenever girls see my eyes or my forearms or my legs, they instantly abandon their boyfriends and ask me to father their children.

Then there's my bank account. Every day, I have to fly over to Federal Reserve to ensure that the economy doesn't crash because of the size of my account. The Secretary of Treasury has to be warned every time I use Apple Pay.

At last there's my brain. It's so dazzingly fast and powerful that I know every skill better than everyone who ever lived. Companies have been battling each other to let me work for them. They are taking loans 12 times their revenue to hire me.

Ugh. Life sucks so much!

Why are classes so polarizing in difficulty?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1gvvhnt/why_are_classes_so_polarizing_in_difficulty/,64,8,2024-11-20 17:51:04,"
Seriously, why is there no middle ground when it comes to class difficulty in college? I’ll have one class that’s basically a free pass—minimal assignments, straightforward material, and almost no stress. Then there’s another class that feels like it’s trying to crush my soul. It’s like taking four easy classes at once, except you don’t get the extra units to show for it.

I made life way more difficult by adding the Data Science Engineering minor to my Cognitive Science major. If I had just done only Cognitive Science, I could have graduated in less than four years with less than 10 hour work weeks. The psychology classes and upper division electives actually hold your hand. Adding DSE absolutely destroyed my mentality by having me compete with some of the highest level math and computer science students who completely destroyed me in classes on the curve with minimal effort.

The hardest part? Professors in the hard classes don’t seem to care that we’re juggling other courses, jobs, and, you know, a life. Meanwhile, the easy class makes me feel like I’m wasting my time and tuition.

Why can’t they balance things out? Spread the effort across the board instead of having this feast-or-famine approach to workload. Does anyone else feel this way, or am I just bad at picking classes?"

Gratitude post: EPICURIA worker,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1gvhcov/gratitude_post_epicuria_worker/,357,9,2024-11-20 04:28:26,"Went to Epic today to pick up some pasta. Apparently my order was spilled somehow and I was a little frustrated considering I had class in 15 minutes. Obviously I never want to cause a scene, but there was a tinge of anger building up with each passing minute I stood next to the line, seeing everyone else get their food normally. Eventually, I was called over by a different cashier and was relieved that my order was finally ready, however, they were only there to apologize-- it was the one who dropped it and he just wanted to be honest about what happened and let me know the order was coming in 5 minutes. My class started in 5, and it had attendance, so I couldn't miss it. The other cashier wouldn't let me redo the order for an hour later, but the man who dropped it insisted that he will pay for another one to be ready after my class at 1. I was honestly astonished that a worker, who would face no repercussions for just walking away and continuing his job, was willing to spend an hour of his pay to buy me a meal later, let alone stand face to face with someone who could've had their day ruined by such a random, unfortunate mistake.

On my way to class, I walked through campus and thought about how everyone is built for their own survival, essentially, that selfishness is more advantageous than selflessness, but my mind had just been twisted. The worker's gratitude gave me happiness, and it was a rare scene of compassion that I found in LA. I was buzzing the whole day after I picked up my meal after class. I wanted to insist on paying it for myself, but the loop of ""insisting"" would have just kept going. At the end of all this, it was me who felt guilty. I decided to swipe in two of my off campus friends for dinner that night, but even then still felt guilty. I had gone so long being selfish that I had forgot how advantageous it was to the soul to share. 

This post is embarrassing as hell, and I probably look like an asshole, but idc as long as I am being honest. Check yourself and make sure there is no hypocrisy within your own soul, make sure you understand who each action you make benefits, and be sure to share that benefit with others. It is obvious that our economic society functions off of selfishness, but money is a false representation of success.

Sincerely,

Leasing date would be 12/19/24-3/19/25 but flexible to suggestions! Rent is $1100/month including utilities, comes fully furnished (I have a full sized bed), wood flooring, and heating/ac. I share the master bedroom with one of my besties (she's a 4th year Comm major!) who is very sweet and tidy. In the other room are my two other besties (4th year physci and CSE).

Overall, my roommates and I are pretty chill, drink on the occasion, don't throw, and enjoy spending time together. House chores are divided so we all take responsibility and love having guests over as well. This spot is perfect for anyone studying abroad, in the Westwood area, or commuter students looking to experience the ""college life,"" even for a couple months!

DM for inquiries and I'm happy to give out more info, pictures, and a tour.

I just bought the Den pass for the UCLA vs. USC football game this Saturday, and I was wondering if I have to reserve a specific ticket/seat in addition to having the Den pass? I saw this mentioned on previous Reddit threads, but it doesn’t mention it anywhere on their website. 

Additionally, I wanted to buy a guest ticket, but I don’t see them available. I believe they were for the student section, so does that mean my guest would be seated in a separate area from me?

My daughter, who is an international student, recently moved into on-campus housing after living off-campus for a while. Her birthday is coming up next week, and I'd love to surprise her with a special gift. I plan to send her a few pictures and small booklets from when she was younger as a birthday present. She has already given us her on-campus housing mail address, some weeks ago.

However, I’m a bit concerned since the envelope and its contents are thicker than a regular one but its still standard sized envelope letter sized. My main worry is how she’ll know it’s there, as she doesn’t really use physical mail often. I don’t want to spoil the surprise by telling her something is coming.

Since this is our first time sending international mail from Ireland, can anyone let me know if she’ll receive a notification about the mail (like a notice for a thick envelope letter)I want to make sure she gets it and opens it without any clues beforehand! It just includes some letters, photos and some of her favourite trinkets and earings that are small sized.

I figured I’d make this post since those of us living on the Hill are trying to figure out where to eat during the upcoming strike. Here’s a couple places I know of where you can get a sizable, healthy meal for well under $10:

-Krishna Lunch: This is a food truck on the Le Conte/Broxton parking lot that runs on weekdays from 11-2. It’s all fresh vegan food and you can get a full meal for a suggested donation of $5. The meals typically consist of some sort of curry with rice, beans, and/or chickpeas, a mishmash of vegetables, corn chips, halava (a small dessert), and lemonade. The guy who runs it is super kind and has been vegetarian for over 50 years. He essentially does this as his retirement project.

-Falafel Inc: This place is on Broxton just across the street from Diddy Riese and is open from 12-9 tomorrow and Thursday. It’s $5 for a falafel sandwich on pita, $6 for a falafel bowl, and $7 for a vegan “shawarma” sandwich on pita. There’s also a number of sides for $3. I’ve personally always enjoyed the food here and it’s much more affordable than most places in Westwood.

I heard it’s assigned based on units but still kids random and idk if that’s true cause I took 4 classes this first quarter so I should have more units than most people so I should get any earlier time? Couldn’t get any of my 5 alternates for the two 2nd pass classes I wanted and even my cluster had only 5 spots left in the Lecture so although a spot is guaranteed I had to take it with the worst TA and worst time. First pass time was also one of the latest so I’m wondering if I’m just unlucky?

The very next day, when I was supposed to head home, I turned on my big ass, gas-guzzlin’ truck, and that hoe was EMPTY. Not like low on gas empty—like EMPTY EMPTY, sittin’ pretty at E.

I was like, “Hold the hell up, who TF stole my gas?!” So, I turned the car off, hopped out, and started inspectin’ that shit. Everything looked cool until I saw that my baby was LEAKING. GAS. EVERYWHERE. Come to find out, some triflin’, dusty-ass bum DRILLED A WHOLE HOLE in my gas tank to steal my gas. Bro, I was HEATED. Had to get my truck towed home, and lemme tell you, it turned into a whole damn event. The fire department pulled up as well.

This all went down between the night of 11/15 and the morning of 11/16. BEWARE, PEOPLE. I park my mamalona in a UCLA lot—not sayin’ WHICH one, ‘cause I don't need more broke, crusty, hater bums to know that information. But let me tell you: if you park at any UCLA lot, watch your damn gas tanks. There are some triflin’, raggedy, dusty-ass losers out here STEALIN’ GAS and DRILLING HOLES.

And to the bum-ass hoe who took MY gas: I hope you step out in traffic and get clipped by a big ass bus just like Regina George. And if I ever catch one of y’all tryin’ to steal from me again, I promise, you WILL be handled accordingly. On my soul. Dead homies."

Ronald Reagan Survival Guide (Psychiatry),https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1gujria/ronald_reagan_survival_guide_psychiatry/,14,12,2024-11-19 00:06:21,"So you’ve been admitted to the psychiatric ward at the reputed Ronald Reagan Medical Center at UCLA. You are now among the ranks of Kanye West, congratulations! You can look forward to good food and good company. The environment is really relaxing at night too, almost like the birth of the cosmos.

You’ll make it out fine, but here’s a guide on how to make things go as smoothly as possible:

1. Maintain composure and you’ll be let out quickly. Take a deep breath, hold it for a bit and slowly let it out. Much better! Avoid talking too fast since this scares the nurses. If you’re lucky they might let you out in a few days. If you follow this successfully you need not read any further. Congrats on your release and get some rest!

2. Oh shit. You’re still here. You didn’t listen to me did you? Maybe you freaked out and everyone thinks you have a disorder? Try to get some rest until you can follow step 1. Take whatever meds they offer you. They will insist like their lives depend on it!

3. Oh no, you’re still here. You didn’t take the meds did you? And now they have put you on a psychiatric hold, which can be a few weeks. You don’t seem to take good advice. Whatever. At least the food is amazing so it makes up for it. What you do from here will determine whether you stay for a few weeks or a few years so listen up carefully.

4. Take your meds ASAP. Regardless of your conscientious objections to medication, they will likely keep you there until you take them. If you don’t take them orally, they will find other ways of getting them in there lol. Don’t worry, they’re professionals.

5. Play along with the nurses and doctors. All staff believe you have a mental illness. If you don’t play along they will view it as you denying your mental illness, which will justify them keeping you in the hospital for longer since they view you as a danger to the public…which you might be, I don’t know you.

6. During a psychiatric hold, your family is allowed to visit you but they might not be able to take you home because of the legal hold. Now, don’t even bother fighting it in court. UCLA’s lawyers are mightier than your state appointed representative. No matter how smart you are, you are a psychiatric patient trying to prove sanity, an oxymoronically downhill battle.

7. Oof, things are really turning sour huh? Looks like you’re really desperate to get out and are trying a few pranks or singing opera really loudly. Well, don’t piss off the big MALE nurses. Just trust me on that one.

8. Attend the art sessions. They’re really therapeutic! Play some table tennis. Interact with other patients but only if they seem calm. You don’t want to be associated with loud or violent patients.  Be the good apple.

9. Try to connect with the nurses there. Believe me, none of them like working there. They’re in an environment where everyone is going out of their minds every day. Be nice to them, ask them about their day and you might make a few friends and get extra yogurt at night! Be nice to the inmat…I mean patients. But remember to do whatever you do in a a very quiet and calm manner. Things get explosive really fast and you don’t want to start a riot. Not fun for anyone involved.

10. Do introverted things like reading, sketching or writing and keep your head down. This will keep you occupied and will also convince staff that you’re approaching sanity, which is often a huge relief for them because they’re anxious to see you leave even if they’ve become friends with you. You might even write better rap than Mr.West.

11. Oof, finally outside! That big yellow thing in the sky is the sun, get used to it! You might be tempted to post your experience on social media. Well, be very careful. UCLA lawyers are like hawks.

12. Lastly don’t hold grudges against staff or inmates, including the hawk-eyed lawyers! Everyone’s just trying to do their job, pay their debts and financially maintain the lifestyle they’re used to! Whatever, at least you’re free now. Get some ice cream.

I'm a senior and applying for jobs/internships, so obviously this doesn't look good if I just use my UC's gpa. Would it be acceptable if when they asked for my gpa I did some sort of conversion to calculate the combined gpa? It doesn't feel right that all those points I got in CC don't count anymore.

I am taking Calculus 2 and my first C++ class. My math class is going great, but my programming class not so much which is my major prep class.

I currently hold a high D, fortunately my professor graciously gives us extra credit opportunities which I have been taking advantage of so with what I have as of now with extra credit included, I am at about a mid C, but the semester isn’t over. 

I want to transfer to UCI, UCLA, UCB, or SJSU all for Computer Engineering. I don’t know what would look worse, a C or failing it and retaking it. I feel confident I can at least get a B next semester, but I don’t want that F on my GPA or transcript. I already have 2 W’s, one of which from this very semester. I am also worried about my financial aid because I am non traditional and I really need it.

My current GPA as it holds is a 3.8, assuming my grade in my math class is stationary and I get a C in my programming class then I will be at a 3.5. I know the UC’s are holistic based on their admission decision. I still have a chance to at least pass, but would a C in a major prep course be fine or fail it and retake it next semester for at least a B? These past several months outside of school has almost killed me, very brutal life is. I do plan to talk to counselor as soon as possible, from what I can see on my college’s website, I can retake the class, it probably won’t affect my GPA, but I am not sure if that F will be on my transcript or GPA. Any advice please?"

Felt hyperwired afterwards so I remembered how last weekend some asshole outside my apartment started yelling at 3am. And then my neighbor like fucking..mgot all freaked out yelling too while naked in his robe and it grossed me out.

So I got into my robe and kept it classy wearing my boxers beneath because I don't give shows for free I staggered like a drunk person to my neighbor's door with my pony tail bumping up and down...I knocked on my neighbor's door. Sure enough he came by and asked me what's up. 


For context, my neighbor once knocked on my door while drunk asking if he could piss on my carpet before I slammer the door shut at his face. Then I heard him slam his body on tbe ground passing out in the hallway. Then the next morning there were shit stains and piss on the ground where he laid. 

Back to tonight...I told him my name is Boozer and that I've come to piss and fart on his face! He looked at me weird. My nuts were getting cold as the heater in our apartment doesn't work so I staggered back and my neighbor was just standing there staring. It took me a while to realize his reaction was delayed because he was high! I could smell his weed. I staggered back inside my apartment and cooked in my robe and underwear.

I see a lot of international students who have started their own startups here in the US. As someone who is planning to do the same in the near future, I was wondering if you guys knew how said students have managed to do so considering the visa implications of working on your own venture. Do they go down the International Entrepreneur Parole route? If they mostly, if not solely, go down the O-1 route instead, what are the requirements that the startup must fulfill in order for their case to be considered strongly irrespective of the other criteria of an O-1? Are there any other non-O-1/EB1-A routes that they take?

So about UCLA football...,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1gsgg7v/so_about_ucla_football/,7,0,2024-11-16 05:36:14,"As the game clock ticks down, a lot has been said of UCLA's performance over the last 4 games. Coming into today's game, UCLA has slowly improved since the beginning ( especially rungame against Iowa ), but their penalties have also increased as well. You could say there's flaws in the teams coaching, players or management but penalties have costed the Bruins an interception and missed scoring opportunities ( though that call in the start of the game for the 1st down was BS by the refs ). I can't even number how much false starts we have had gotten which has limited the explosive plays UCLA has had this season. UCLA has a lot of room to improve but, they have showed us that they have some fight in their BIG10 debut. Preseason talks would always include the typical Bruins being a ""weak link"" compared to other powerhouses but they aren't necessarily a bad or good team, just a enough to get the job done sort of team. But with any other sports team, us as fans have to keep on having faith for OUR school and team at the end of the day."

The sun had set, no dew forming on the grass yet. A perfect in-between. Night was on its way, forcing the day out. As I took my seat under Bunche, on the pedestal that is a few feet above those walking excited for Friday, a peculiar laugh hit me; there I was, fully knowing that I had just wasted a shit ton of my parents money on a failed class, but laughing. There was a tinge of hope, a relaxation only understood by those at the bottom of their class, but still seeing that there was something to be above, something to conquer, even if that was just the short physical presence watching people pass by. 

As much as we like to feel doomed, feel under the weight of powerful people in suits, bosses and their bosses, we are always above something. In fact, we are always above many, many things, and that is what we must be thankful for. There is food on our table and youtube to watch.

i've heard that comm 105 has just a midterm and a final while info studies m137 has weekly tasks. i know i'm going to have a busy quarter so i'm debating which style of class is better, on one hand comm 105 will be less work to do weekly but on the other hand the weekly tasks for info studies will help to keep me on track so i don't fall behind.

my other thought process is the class time. i have my major capstone starting at 6:30pm on the day these classes would be, and week 5-7 it'll start even earlier at 6pm. info studies is from 4-5:50pm, so i won't have much time to get dinner and reset before my capstone class. comm 105 also starts at 4, but ends at 5:15 which lowkey might be better for my minimal attention span.

To the person that called the cops on me at the University Village Apartments,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1gq7bo8/to_the_person_that_called_the_cops_on_me_at_the/,1413,105,2024-11-13 07:10:52,"To the person who called the cops on me for knocking on your door at the university village apartments: please introduce yourself next time you see me in the complex. I don’t know what you look like, but I’m pretty sure I saw you looking through the peephole, so you know what I look like. Maybe if you talk to me, you won’t find me so scary that you feel the need to call the cops.

I tried to introduce myself because I could hear you in your apartment. I mean, we always hear you because you’re so loud. It sounds like you’re dropping weights on the floor or moving furniture throughout the night. Since you didn’t open the door, I left a note stating that I’m your downstairs neighbor and that I had called maintenance because water was overflowing into our kitchen sink every time you used yours. Maintenance asked me to go up and request that you not use your sink while they sent someone out for an emergency maintenance request.

I was hesitant to knock because I know what I look like: a big Hispanic guy who maybe doesn’t seem like he belongs at UCLA. I get looks that say as much on South Campus all the time. I figured this might be your response, but I thought I’d give you the benefit of the doubt. As soon as I came back in, I told my wife, “You know what? I think they’re going to call the cops on me.”

Some might ask why my wife didn’t go instead. Maybe she would seem less threatening. But why should we have to live like that? My first instinct was to say a big FU to you, but I know that’s not the best response. Just know that calling the cops could have ended badly for me.

You didn’t have to open the door. You could’ve just asked what I wanted. I understand not wanting to open the door to a stranger—I might not, either. But jumping straight to calling the cops? Luckily, UCPD contacted after-hours maintenance, and they called me to let me know you’d called them. They asked me not to go up anymore because you were really scared. The maintenance dispatch staff said it was the first time someone had called the cops for something like this. They were shocked. The sad thing is, I wasn’t."

I was fired because I was not able to keep up with the fast paced work environment that they wanted me to and we mutually parted, but I was given a dismissal letter on my last day. 

I got fired about a month ago and since then I have been trying to get answers as to whether I am eligible for unemployment for a while. I reached out to my HR department who then said they couldn't give me guidance and gave me a contact for the whole schoolwide system, then I emailed them and was transferred to 2 different people, waiting almost a week between responses and as of right now I am still waiting to even KNOW if I am eligible for unemployment.

My questions are:

\- Do I need to wait for approval to apply for unemployment from my old job? I have searched online and gotten a wide plethora of answers and they are rarely talking about student jobs so i'm not sure if they apply to me. This was my first job and I have no clue about any of this stuff. If i can apply for unemployment where would I do it in the state of California?

\- Am i eligible for backpay for unemployment since i've been bounced around between departments for 1 month now and haven't applied yet? Or does unemployment payments begin the day that I am approved for it and so I would not get paid for the last month I have been out of a job?"

Hi all! 

I'm a full-time student at UCI and was looking into taking an upper division Summer course at Berkeley this last Summer. I had added the class to my cart but to my understanding, never even checked out or enrolled. I eventually never even ended up taking the class because my Regents and Middle class scholarships from UCI wouldn't transfer and the course was absurdly too expensive for me to ever take (my current tuition at UCI is about $200 per unit and this was ten times more expensive). I don't even remember what the class was for. I never once enrolled, opened canvas, or completed a single assignment. To my knowledge, I didn't even know that I was enrolled in that course. 

Last month, though, I received an email from Berkeley billing saying that I owed $2,311.50? This is a complete shock to me as I don't even believe I enrolled in the course and if I had been, I should have been dropped for not participating in it. 

Has anyone had a similar experience with successfully fighting these fees and if so, I’d love any advice you can give. 

If anyone has done summer sessions at another UC I’d love your input. 

Have a beautiful rest of your day! "

I took a Dance 101 class for IGETC and it looks like im going to end up having a B in it since this was the only class I didn't use rate my professor for and I frankly know nothing about dance. If I get a B in this class but I continue with all As is that okay? How flexible is it?   
  
My sister goes to UCLA and she makes a big deal saying I HAVE to get all As since CS is a competitive field.   
  
Any thoughts? Could any CS majors share the school and GPA they transfered from? I've been stressing about it recently and need to know if its a valid thing to worry about. Thanks."

1. I understand a series must be taken at the same place, like all bios classes must be done in the same school for example. However, does it matter if I do my bio series at UCLA and then my physics series at WestLA for example?
2. Some schools have fewer pre-requisites for the pre-med classes. For example, at UCLA, I need to do a bunch of math classes (3A, B, & C or Lifesci 30A & B) before I can even take Physics, whereas at WestLA there are no pre-recs to take physics. Does it matter which school my premed classes are done at, given that the number of classes needed can ultimately vary? How does this look to med schools if I choose to take the shortest path to complete the classes?
3. UCLA's premed class list is longer than something like westLA's, for example, the bio series at UCLA is 3 classes (7A, B, & C) and at westLA it's 2 classes (6 & 7). Is this undesirable by top med schools like UCLA, or even other med schools more broadly? Again, are more classes better than less?
4. Can I graduate UCLA, get my Psych BA degree, and take my premeds at a community college while I prepare for the MCAT and apply to med schools? Does it not matter that my premed classes are done after I graduate?

Im a biochem freshman looking to switch into chemE (yes i know chemE is not very chem related its more about fluids and thermo) but i was wondering if i can have a three year plan to graduate ChemE, I'm taking 32b, 1b+4al, and 20b winter quarter. I already preemptively planned out a double major schedule too, but it needs some work and optimization if anyone knows the best route. I am willing to do all 4 GEs in a summer session and maybe take on more summer sessions if necessary 

also, I don't get declaring the major. I believe its 90 required units at ucla before you can declare, but are you allowed to take upper div classes before that mark? Do you need to request for a councilor to manually enroll you? My biggest fear is that I have to ""waste"" a quarter by not being able to take upper divs because im only missing one class to fulfill all of my prereqs. Obviously this would mean graduating in three years is practically impossible, can someone explain upper div enrollment?"

Since the beginning I had someone that had previously been an instructor teach me the backhand and forehand technique but that's mainly all we've practiced up til now. I can usually clear the net if I get fed easy hits but still not good enough to hit it across when the ball is really quick or coming from weird angles.

They're super busy now with school (understandable) but now that I know that I enjoy Tennis I was looking to get someone who's experienced to play with and give me tips and coaching. (PM me and I can talk about pay in cash or swipes, not allowed to put it in this post).

Anyone interested shoot me a DM and we can work something out o7

prospective stem club ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1goeztz/prospective_stem_club/,13,4,2024-11-11 00:08:17,"hello!

if ur like me, ur interested in pursuing a stem-related field, but you’re not ready to buckle down on a specific subject. whether it’s because ur indecisive, feel like u haven’t really had to opportunity to explore all of ur options, or downright just have commitment issues, then i am speaking to u!

in addition, it’s even more overwhelming as most stem clubs have extremely specific mission statements and/or expect u to already be cracked af with tons of experience. 

with this in mind, i am looking to start a club that gives members opportunities to explore a variety of different stem subjects/projects. through workshops, socials, and club x stem club collaborations, we can cultivate an environment that allows peeps to gain a better perspective on various fields, and how these fields overlap with one another. this club can help students make more informed decisions about pursing certain stem majors, and develop a well-rounded understanding of the vast stem fields.

would love to hear from y’all; whether this is a flippity-fantastic, a totally copy cat of something that is already being done, or should be euthanized on the spot right here right now!! anything is appreciated!!

also if u are interested in helping this project come to fruition lmk!

sincerely, a second year applied math student who has no idea what they want to do with their life :D"

So, here’s my question: Should I keep cold emailing? Or would it be better to wait until sophomore year, after taking more chemistry classes, before reaching out again? Or should I consider applying for the biomedical research minor to get matched with a lab?"
