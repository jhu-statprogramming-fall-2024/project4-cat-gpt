Change of Major Petition to CoE (Computer Engineering) Worth it? ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1gwo6km/change_of_major_petition_to_coe_computer/,4,4,2024-11-21 19:38:20,"For context, I'm currently a first year who was admitted into the college of letters for Sociology and before the year started, I decided I wanted to pursue a major change into Computer Engineering (which was my first choice when I applied to colleges). I've been interested in this field since middle school and I've found a pleasure in building and taking apart computers, learning how circuits work, and even playing around with Arduino on my free time.   

However, I was admitted to UCD for Computer Engineering and decided to come to UCSB simply because it was more selective and the opinion all around was that UCSB is a better school.  I also committed here because I thought UCD wasn't as good for Computer Engineering considering they're an agriculture school and whatnot. 

But now as I'm basically gambling whether or not I'll be getting the classes I need to actually switch into the major (which apparently isn't guaranteed regardless of academic performance), I'm starting to feel like I'm fighting more wars than needed.

My financial aid at UCSB was a big reason for why I committed (especially with the promise scholars scholarship), but I'm still paying out-of-pocket money regardless and I'm really starting to feel like pursuing a major my heart feels committed to at a school where 1. I don't have the major, 2. Getting the major is highly unlikely, and 3. If you don't have the major, you don't get the priority to the classes, is not worth the money and time had I gone to another school, like UCD, where I had the major guaranteed. This would've let me re-direct my stress to finding involvement on campus, getting hands-on, work, internships, etc.

At the end of the day, I was just a high schooler who thought that the school you went to determined how successful you would be, or that a CE degree from Davis wasn't as ""competent"". Anyway, I've been trying to evaluate the situation maturely and I'm not sure if I'd be better off going to CC then transferring, or re-applying to Davis (or other UC's) and hope I get admitted for the same major again. Either way, I guess it's still good I'm going through this to grow and learn from mistakes. 

I'll definitely talk to academic advising, but I wanted to see what other students might think.

The weather is horrible compared to Santa Barbara, there is no beach anywhere nearby, and the job opportunities seem pretty limited.

chances at transferring as comms major?!,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1gvf4x2/chances_at_transferring_as_comms_major/,0,10,2024-11-20 02:31:13,"i’m a currently a 3rd year at cc in socal! i’m nervous as to my chances at transfer due to an extremely rough start at cc due to a traumatic event that occurred on campus! I went from a 1.4gpa my first semester to getting straight A’s earlier this year (4.0 for the entire semester). So there is an upward trend!

i was able to raise my up to a 3.3-3.4 gpa and could possibly get a few points higher after my winter and spring courses! I am applying this fall/right now! I am applying to all the UCs like UCSB, UCSD, UCSC and etc! I am also applying to other privates like USC etc and possibly CSUs! I am a communications major! I have also been working two jobs my entire duration at cc.

some thoughts on career path from a TA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1gsrzhl/some_thoughts_on_career_path_from_a_ta/,79,4,2024-11-16 17:16:13,"I'm a TA, and I've received several students that have asked me about career paths post-graduation. I figured I'd write down some thoughts on a few things I think are underrated when it comes to finding a career. This is a long post and may not be relevant for many. 

What should you do with your life? While I don’t have definitive answers, I can offer a few heuristics. These aren’t prescriptions but rather thoughts I’ve found useful for figuring out what actually matters.

Firstly, I think it’s underrated to consider the people you’ll work with every day. It's obvious, but if you work a 9-to-5 and spend 5-10 pm with your family, you’re spending more time with your coworkers than your family. Your coworkers' personalities, values, and habits will influence you, for better or worse.

Are these people (in this field, this area of work) ones you’d want as friends? Do you genuinely enjoy being around them? Do your coworkers share your curiosity about the world? Do they care about solving the same types of problems you do? Do they approach challenges with a mindset you admire? Sometimes—and this is really unfortunate, but the truth—compatibility comes down to factors like whether you feel welcome and accepted, especially if you're an outsider demographic to this field. Compatibility doesn’t mean you have to be the same, but if, after a couple of years, you still feel like an outsider—struggling to connect—it might be a sign something’s off, either with this particular job, or perhaps with this entire field. At that point, you have to choose whether you can be the flag-bearing outsider (which is admittedly a more courageous but challenging path), or whether you should switch paths. 

Talk to 10 people working in Seattle's big tech, 10 in Silicon Valley's startup scene, and 10 on New York’s Wall Street, and you’ll notice how different are the way they communicate, the topic of their conversation, and the content of their daily thoughts. You will become more and more like your coworkers. If the way they comport themselves irritates you, avoid them. So that’s the first heuristics: follow people you could be friends with.

Another way to make decisions less overwhelming is to work backward from where you want to end up. Who are the people you envy, the ones whose lives make you think, ""I wish I could do that""? Maybe it’s a scientist, an entrepreneur, or someone in your extended family whose life feels like a quiet success. Maybe it's someone that just seems extremely happy and content with their life. Trace their path. What degrees did they pursue? What early jobs and experiences shaped their trajectory? Did they regret any of those steps? This isn’t a perfect strategy, of course—the world changes, and paths that worked in the past may not work now. But we often ignore this simple approach. One example I’m always amazed by is how FDR rose to political prominence by mirroring the trajectory of his cousin, Theodore Roosevelt. Both began in New York politics, served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, became Governor of New York, and eventually president. So, once you’ve decided on an end goal, doggedly pursue it by imitating people that have already achieved that goal. 

In imitating people, one of the best ways to learn about these paths is to talk to people. LinkedIn isn’t just for recruiters—it’s for you. Cold message someone whose career you admire and ask if they’d be willing to chat. Most people are generous when it comes to sharing their stories, especially if you approach them with genuine curiosity as a younger professional. Asking for a 15-minute conversation can shift your perspective.

Risk analysis is also an important method for thinking about your career. Charlie Munger had a morbid but useful saying: ""All I want to know is where I’m going to die so I’ll never go there."" Applied to careers, this is incredibly practical. Figure out the most likely ways your career could go wrong, and then avoid those scenarios like the plague. If you’re prone to depression, moving to a dreary town with no sunlight could be terrible. If you’re prone to alcoholism, and your job requires regular dining and happy hours, that could be a problem. I'm not saying it has to be a problem, but you should at least be aware of the problem. You don’t need perfect foresight, but you should take time to write down potential pitfalls.

Besides looking out for pitfalls, you should consider the outcome distribution. Some careers offer predictable outcomes. Becoming an accountant comes with a fairly tight band of expected salaries and job stability. This can be great—or terrible! If you’re used to working hard and seeing rewards, it can be disconcerting when you’re not recognized for your work. Careers where there’s a clear link between your contribution and the end result often offer greater rewards for high achievers. Other careers are wildly different. They have ""right-tailed distributions,"" where a tiny fraction of people reap enormous rewards. Think about actors, musicians, or entrepreneurs. In these fields, the median outcome might be modest—or even dismal—but top performers become household names.

How do you feel about chasing long odds? If you consistently outperform, maybe you should aim for a right-tailed field. But know the stakes: there’s a good chance you’ll land near the middle, and you have to be okay with that. Most baseball players never make it to the major leagues. Most academics don’t land tenure-track jobs at Harvard. Most musicians don’t get a million listens. But these paths aren’t failures. Many people in these fields live deeply fulfilling lives because they love the work, regardless of where they land. Some fields heavily reward exceptional talent, while others don’t differentiate much between the great and the good. Choose accordingly. Are you content with the process—the grind, the craft, the relationships—and find it meaningful enough even if you don’t hit the jackpot?

You should try your best to work on big problems that excite you. It is generally the case that a stupid person with obsession can achieve greater things than an genius that doesn't obsess. Think of it like playing videogames. I guarantee you the most intelligent person on the planet, if forced to play a videogame that the least intelligent person on the planet has been playing for 20 years, would lose. In fact, they would lose repeatedly. It's like those studies that find that the best indicator for how good you are at chess is actually just the amount of time you've spent playing and studying chess. Same here--deliberate practice matters, but your skill at a certain field will depend on the amount of obsession and time you put into it. Obsession will lead to finding a group of like-minded people, which leads to more deliberate practice. Begin with trying to solve problems that you can obsess over. 

Luck plays an outsized role in many careers, but luck isn’t purely random. You can increase your odds by putting yourself in environments where opportunities are more likely to emerge. Surround yourself with ambitious, curious, and motivated people. If you’re around people who constantly tinker with new ideas or pursue interesting projects, some of that energy will rub off on you. Geography matters for luck. Certain cities or industries concentrate talent and ideas, accelerating serendipity. Breaking into film? LA is better than a random suburb. Want to work in tech? The Bay Area has its perks.

Finally, your personal life. The timing and trajectory of your income can shape family plans in ways you might overlook. Careers with delayed financial rewards, like medicine, might cause you to delay starting a family. Careers with steep early salaries like banking might offer more financial flexibility in your 20s but sacrifice work-life balance. Think about when you want certain milestones—kids, a house, financial independence—and how your career aligns with those goals. Money isn’t everything, but it determines when you can afford stability, and stability matters when building a life with others.

The heuristics I’ve outlined are just tools to help you reflect. When in doubt, seek advice from those who’ve walked the path before you, try the job out (get an internship or even just take the job and quit after one year!), and remain open to life’s serendipity. "

Worried about making friends?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1gs86qf/worried_about_making_friends/,64,1,2024-11-15 22:10:51,"Alumni here. I’m seeing so many posts about 1st years who are worried about the fact that it’s almost winter quarter and they haven’t made a single friend. 
In my freshman year between starting a relationship and being the third wheeler in my triple, I thought for sure I was doomed. The relationship didn’t work out and my roommates were becoming increasingly hostile. So I actively started putting myself out there, going to the dorm events put on by the RA, looking at people who took similar classes with me and whether they might be in the same dorm. With time you’ll notice that there are people in your major that you continuously see every quarter. Y’all are so lucky to have Shoreline! 10 years when I started in 2014 everything was word of mouth and flyers. Scroll down that list and see if anything perks your interest. 
Sometimes it only takes one person to connect you with a whole group of people. I would say that by the end of winter quarter, beginning of spring I had established a reliable group of people to hang out with. 

Also get comfortable with being the initiator! I had a friend that would start a group chat and everytime he went to dinner, he’d let the group know and sometimes he’d go alone and sometimes we had a squad. Everytime he went to go watch a sunset, group chat. Going on a trip downtown, group chat. 

Eventually by sophomore year, the group had expanded to absorb with another friend group from a different dorm. And at the end of four years, we were all still close and even if we had our own things going on sometimes, it was still so nice to be able to have that support system.

Good luck, you’ll genuinely never be surrounded by this many people that are similar in age, make the most of it! "

No clue what to do in the future and need advice (PolSci),https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1gsaasy/no_clue_what_to_do_in_the_future_and_need_advice/,6,14,2024-11-15 23:49:13,"So I’m currently a CC student, however I’m on track to finish early w/a great GPA (I’m not trying to be arrogant or anything just trying to layout the fact admissions/TAG isn’t a worry). 

Anyways, I’ve always known what I wanted to major in (Poli Sci) however now that I’m finally in college, realization hit that I really have no clue what to do career wise. And now I’m questioning for the first time my academic career as well.

I always thought that I needed to purse grad school and achieve at least an MBA. Poli Sci isn’t really a money making field if you’re trying to be ethical (I.e not instantly going into lobbying for Raytheon or Lockheed Martin). 

Thus, I always assumed in order to be able to make around 6 figures or close I would need at least an MBA. However — even if I did I’m questioning what I want to do. If I did pursue a MBA I’d want it to be something concerning Political Theory / Domestic Policy. Do I go to UCSB for grad?? Do I go to Georgetown for grad??

It’s between becoming a professor (which I’d then pursue a PhD) but my concerns with this is that getting a position secured (let alone being published) is not guaranteed. I could possibly make virtually little money being an assistant/adjunct professor to have no fruition. 

Or I could pursue domestic policy, with the ultimate goal(s) being a Chief of Staff for a federal offical (or gov.); campaign manager etc., But would I need a MBA for this? 

I would love to work in D.C., ultimately however I love California so much. 

However to work in D.C., don’t I need to start establishing a name for myself in D.C. by living in D.C.? E.g. going to grad school (GW/Georgetown) and pursuing internships. 

I don’t know. I’m young but scared. I don’t want to end up paycheck to paycheck because I’m deciding to choose my major of interest rather than pursuing a major which would guarantee me a comfortable job that I’d probably be indifferent too at best. 

I’m spewing rn, and I just hope for some advice from alumni or upperclassmen "

Experience with Berkeley summer sessions ,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1gqlmza/experience_with_berkeley_summer_sessions/,0,3,2024-11-13 19:45:03,"Summer Session Fee, help please! 


Hi all! 

I'm a full-time student at UCI and was looking into taking an upper division Summer course at Berkeley this last Summer. I had added the class to my cart but to my understanding, never even checked out or enrolled. I eventually never even ended up taking the class because my Regents and Middle class scholarships from UCI wouldn't transfer and the course was absurdly too expensive for me to ever take (my current tuition at UCI is about $200 per unit and this was ten times more expensive). I don't even remember what the class was for. I never once enrolled, opened canvas, or completed a single assignment. To my knowledge, I didn't even know that I was enrolled in that course. 

Last month, though, I received an email from Berkeley billing saying that I owed $2,311.50? This is a complete shock to me as I don't even believe I enrolled in the course and if I had been, I should have been dropped for not participating in it. 

Has anyone had a similar experience with successfully fighting these fees and if so, I’d love any advice you can give. 

If anyone has done summer sessions at another UC I’d love your input. 

Have a beautiful rest of your day! "

But I graduated a zillion years ago and don't know what's useful these days. What would you recommend? Great if you can give a direct link, but also useful if you just share the name of a place or how to find it.

I'd like to also include tips about avoiding housing scams, so if you have any specific tips that you always recommend, include those here and I'll work them into the copy-paste.

Thanks all!"

Division is not the answer (in response to the election),https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1gme6d9/division_is_not_the_answer_in_response_to_the/,7,38,2024-11-08 08:47:37,"With the results coming out that trump won, many of us are devastated. Others, maybe glad. 

Personally I am devastated. 
However i notice there’s been a rise of polarizing media from both trump supporters and democrats. Trump supporters are posting videos immaturely mocking democrats, and democrats are posting content saying that they will not be friends with anyone who voted trump. 
I understand the anger, and the pain, and the frustration. 

But I don’t think villainizing each other for the vote is the answer. No matter who someone voted they believe they did the “right” thing, I assume nobody wants to be a bad person. We do what we do because we think it is “right”, but our versions of what is “right” is different. Hating on eachother is not going to help at all, it’s just going to pull everyone further and further away until it looks like a figurative civil war. 

Listen to each other, try to understand eachother and find connection within chaos. I know that when you show respect to someone, they are more likely to hear out your side too.

That’s really the only way to get through anything at all. 

At the end of the day, we gotta aim for peace. There is no world where everyone will agree, there is no family where everyone will agree. Our country is like one big and diverse family. We have to try to understand eachother, to try to have compassion for each-other.  Just like how we can get angry at our own siblings or friends, it’s okay to get can angry at eachother too when we have been wronged, but if healthy, will always come back together through a sense of kinship.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia were two ideological opposites, but stayed friends throughout their lives. They shared a love for opera, and that’s what brought them together. It’s their similarities that connected them, not their differences that separated them. That’s just really beautiful, and something we can learn from. 

We are all victims to the same system, and higher powers. We can still unite despite our differences.

I clearly underestimated the deep rooted misogyny and racism this country holds by a long shot. The democrats planned Kamala’s campaign terribly, she entered the race way to late and she isn’t exactly the most charismatic leader, but when you look at political issues from an objective standpoint, she was better than Trump in every way imaginable.

"Trump won, need a local guy to explain why it matters",https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1gl4hab/trump_won_need_a_local_guy_to_explain_why_it/,0,39,2024-11-06 17:52:22,"So, I'm international, and I don't see why Trump winning have an impact at all: Those states that are red will continue to be red and the states that are blue will remain blue. Economically speaking, it's not like anybody would make a difference anyways, Trump might go around signing a few billion dollar grants and impose tarriffs that will raise Cost of living, but that's about it, on the flip side, if Trump is serious about developing US oil reserves, we might see a decrease in oil price. So to me, it seems like 50-50. Which means basically, I don't see anything Trump offers being worse than Harris other than the ideological part, which seems unimportant.

I also read their ""great plans""(basically the PDFs) and I think any econ major graduate could drink alphabet soup and sh\*t out better plans to revive the economy than they have. I find Trump's plan especially funny as he had to make EVERYTHING CAPITALIZED AND BOLD. I thought he was yelling the whole way. The way the plan was written actually sounded like Trump, which was amusing.

To sum up, to me as a foreigner, it seems like Kamala and Donald isn't really that different as the changes they can bring cannot fundamentally change America. IDK, any thoughts?

Edit 1: I'm talking about US domestic, not foreign, I'm more than aware of Trump's stupid foreign policies, which is almost laugable when it comes to tarriffs. It's Trump's domestic policies I'm really curious about.

Edit 2: Now, from my observations, it seems as if everyone is anti-Trump. I guess maybe it's because we're in a blue state, but I'm seeing nothing good about Trump in comments, how did he get elected then? Perhaps it's the Churchill moment: ""The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the *average voter""?*

Edit 3:   
From the comments below, it seems that Trump is

1. Is anti-enviromental protectionalism

2. Gutted title IX

3. Gutted the Educational department(or wants to)

4. ban abortions

5. Decreasing tax on the rich

6. Ukraine

7. Being Anti foreign

8. Tarriffs

From a foreigner's perspective, I'll comment on them.

a) I don't think that enviroment protection is an issue in the states, not because it isn't important, but simply because there are no factories around to cause enough pollution to a point where the government needs to put it in as an issue it needs to tackle primarily. Yeah sure, du-pont and the others aren't exactly helping, but the lack of huge quantities of chemical-factories determines that pollution in the USA won't go off the charts like it did in other countries with lots of factories. I don't think it's a terrible policy to loosen enviromental protection regulations here, I give a 70%

b) Unable to make a comment, I'll pass that

c) same above

d) Yeah, banning abortion might've been the dumbest policies I've seen in a while. Not exactly unheard off, but as a world leader, yikes. -1000%

e) Not the first to do it, would it work? IDK, sounds like trickle down economy to me, very skeptical. 40%

f) I personally believe Ukraine isn't going to win no matter what, at the very least Russia isn't going to lose, it's just going to look ugly for the Russians, in the end, it might end up like the Soviet-Finish war, where the soviets won with a heavy cost. I do think it's a good idea to gradually stop, 80%

g) I believe his anti-foreign attitudes is mostly directed towards illegal immigrants people, and not legal ones. I really don't get why everyone is against the policy of border control and deporting illegal immigrants. If everyone cared so much about the illegal immigrants' well-being, we should be giving them work-visas instead of letting them stay here working in some sweatshop. We should opt to create new visas and loosen regulations on the green card instead of not deporting them. It feels kinda hypocritical to me that certain people dislike the policy of deporting illegal immigrants yet doesn't want to hand out green cards to those illegal immigrants. 

But what needs to be said is Trump needs to be careful with human rights issue along the way(such as not seperating families). I also think the policy along is going to suck the USA of it's work force, hence this policy needs to be accompanied by loosening of green card regulations and other forms of work-visas. We'll see how this is executed. ratings: T.B.A.

h) Tarriffs are absolutely neccessary IF Trump is serious about reviving the US manufacturing capabilites. He will need to implement like 200% tarriffs or something(An econ major can do the calculation here). But I do not think that even with such insane protection of local factories, US cannot compete with China in the industrial sector. But hey, it might solve a bit of unemployment. I give it a 50%."

I know that most people would just tell me its normal to have doubts like this as a first year and that I just need to adjust and give it time but in my gut I just know that its not right. I don't see myself living here for the next 3 years and I *know* I would be more happy back home at community or a csu like I initially planned. 



I was admitted off the waitlist and with my financial aid it was a ridiculous opportunity to turn down, and now I feel like the decision was somewhat impulsive. the school in itself is great--the academics are fine, the beach is pretty--but I still just don't feel right here, and I don't think I could ever call iv or sb home for that matter.

it also sucks that with the credits I came in with i'm on track to graduate in 3 years, and that's with two minors planned out too. so I feel like transferring would be a loss of the progress I have here and if I wait any longer there would be no point. if I do transfer im adding back the usual 4th year regardless because of the need to take ges or major requirements that are different at other universities.

Paranormal Activity at Santa Ynez?,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1gj7hoi/paranormal_activity_at_santa_ynez/,22,39,2024-11-04 05:50:03,"I'm a transfer student that started this school year so I've only been living in the Santa Ynez Apartments for a little over a month. I live in the 200s on the first floor, so I hear the usual foot steps from my upstairs neighbors, or feel my bed shaking whenever someone closes a door too hard. The furniture here is pretty unstable at times since its held together with a couple screws and its cheap quality.

Anyways, I would consider myself to be a believer in the paranormal, but I don't go out of my way to conjure up any spirits or whatever. I would also consider myself to be very aware of my surrounds at all times, and don't like to jump to conclusions.

However, when something happens that I can't explain, it creeps me out big time. Since I've been living here, I've experienced two separate events that I don't have an explanation for.

The first experience occurred around mid-October. For context, I live in a triple, and I sleep on the top bunk of my bunkbed, and my desk is right below, no one sleeps below me. It was around 2am and I, and the rest of my roommates were sound asleep. Then, I was woken up by the feeling of my bed shaking. The shaking had to have lasted for around a minute, and it was very calm shaking, like something was gently shaking the frame of my bunkbed. I peeked through my curtains to look outside to see if I could see anything, but saw nothing going on. I was convinced it was a mini-earthquake so I searched on my phone to see if there were any, but no results showed, so I just shut my eyes and when back to sleep, still feeling a gentle shake.

It couldn't have been my upstairs neighbors moving stuff around and causing a vibration, as I didn't hear any footstep and they're never awake that late. Nevertheless, I chucked it off as being my imagination.

My perspective of this event changed however when around an hour ago, I experience another strange occurrence. Today's November 3rd, so about two weeks after I felt my bed shaking. I was doing some studying at my desk with my air pods in, and my door was slightly cracked open (I never close it all the way). I was alone in my room, and two of my roommates were in the kitchen. No one else in the house (believe me, I checked). I suddenly hear my door shut, as if someone from outside my room pulled it closed. This already seemed weird to me, so I got up and opened my door, expecting to see someone on the other side using the sink that's right outside my room. No one was there. I went over to my two roommates in the kitchen and asked if they closed any doors anywhere in the house or heard any close. They didn't (they also had air pods in). My roommates wouldn't lie to me either, we've never talked about the paranormal or anything before so this wouldn't have been a prank.

Today however has been pretty windy, so doors have a possibility to close on their own as a result. The window in my room was only slightly open (I felt no wind coming through when the door closed), and our bathroom window was open but if there was a sudden gush of wind it would've blown the opposite direction of the way my door closed.

And I tested my door numerous times to see if it would close on its own when its open just a little bit, but it didn't close on its own. Plus, it sounded like there was some force involved when it closed as I could hear it even with my air pods in.

So, now I'm curious if anyone else has had any weird experiences here that they can't explain, please let me know! I've heard rumors that this place is built on past Native American territory which some have claimed causes weird things to happen."

Since the program is getting more competitive every year I'm panicking what to do stand out. I read on their website that they primarily care about college experience (not high school) and I only have a little more than 1.5 years left until I have to submit my application, so that really isn't much time. I was wondering what I should do to stand out.

1. I was thinking about doing undergrad research and emailed three professors, but one of them said there are no openings and the other two ghosted me. I'll continue emailing professors, but since I had no success with the three professors I emailed so far I'm afraid if I'll ever be able to find a professor who lets me do research with them. Furthermore, if I want to do research to stand out in the application, I need to get that position by Fall 2025 the latest for the professor to have enough time to write me a letter of recommendation.

2. I am minoring in statistical science, and I will perhaps even double major in it if I have time (If I take classes over the summer I'll be able to do the double major in three years), will that make made me stand out?

3. I was also thinking about doing internships over the summer, but the market is very bad now and so far I've just gotten rejections.

4. Will joining robotics or programming clubs help?

5. Will doing personal programming projects on GitHub help?

Any advice on what I should I do to stand appreciated!

Format: post the event in the gc, ask if anyone’s down, and yeah :) I’m legit just looking to meet more people cause it’s kind of discouraging when it feels like everyone has their established friend groups already after people got lucky with roommates or flatmates

EDIT: i want this to be pretty structured and organized that this won’t just fall out to be another “instagram exchange” thing—like let’s build connections with who you really are and let’s do that by doing things you’re genuinely interested in, not just going to events for the sake of “needing to go out”, but because you have an interest in it :))

EDIT 2: legit I’m welcoming everyone—college can be so lonely, so I want to reach out to a different crowd (you :\] )

**DETAILS**: I’m gonna make an Instagram and a Discord server.

Instagram for people who prefer this platform ofc—will most likely be more casual but might be chaotic (more for last minute plans and such :))

Discord will be more structured—we’ll start in a general chat for now but can branch into diff channels etc etc.. (ex: only get a ping for certain types of events once we see the trend of what people tend to want to do)—I’ll get it started but someone who’s more knowledgeable in this can get this sorted too !

Insta: pm me with your Instagram and I’ll add you to the group chat tomorrow (expect late afternoon, I have hw tonight yall lol)

Discord: pm me with interest and I’ll send you a link to join tmrw (expect it in the afternoon)

Both: Just tell me, “hey I wanna be in both!” lol

Thanks and love to you all (only if ur cool and ur realest self)

**EDIT 3:** I just finished making an Instagram and Discord server. It's easier to congregate to one area than me trying to piece everyone together individually, so...

Instagram: u/imdownucsb (courtesy of fatuous4 for the idea!) follow/msg and i'll make a groupchat :)

I took midterm 1 for econ 10A, did horrible, and decided to drop the class and switch my major to sociology. I'm planning to apply to law school so I felt that econ/accounting didn't play to my strengths and also didn't make sense for my future career plans. Personally, it makes more sense to prioritize a high GPA and LSAT prep rather than devoting so much time to a major that wasn't working for me. 

During class registration for this quarter, I signed up for both Econ 10A and Econ 5, and I dropped 10A last week before the deadline. After that, I'm only enrolled in two classes, 5 and an upper division elective. I want to submit a request to withdraw from 5 since I don't need the class anymore as I am in the process of switching majors, and again, I don't want to get a bad grade for literally no reason.  However, since I am already not at the 12 unit requirement to be considered a full time student (I am 9 currently), and if approved, I would be only taking one class (which is pretty bad). I am not very confident in the possibility that I would be allowed to withdraw from 5 but I want to get out of the class."
Housing for Transfers after the 1st year,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1gecwp8/housing_for_transfers_after_the_1st_year/,10,1,2024-10-28 20:54:03,"Hey all, basically, I'm a transfer student (junior) and I'm living in an off campus university owned apartment this year. 

I recognize that after the 1st year, housing is no longer guaranteed by the university. Furthermore, I've been told that people start looking for next year's housing as early as November? So, now I'm worried about looking for housing next year. 

Basically, what I'm wondering two things: 

1) how unlikely is it to get university housing after your 1st year guantee is over, because I'm pretty reliant on financial aid? 

2) where do I start with looking for housing for next year? ant recommendations or advice from seniors or others who have done this process already?

For some background, I've taken the AP Physics Cs, so Physics 7A would be review material-wise. However, the sections seem long, and I don't know how much homework there will be (probably professor-dependent). I'm ok with physics but it's not my intuitive strong suit either.

As for Mus 16, it fulfills some nice GE reqs but I've been hesitant to take any writing courses because I tend to take a lot more time than probably necessary when writing things off the top of my head (and I also don't particularly like assigned reading either, yeah I know). But if it's not graded harshly then I may go for it. Also, anyone know how important section attendance is/what gets done in section?

I was told by the advisors that they liked my writing and asked what they would grade it if they were my professor and they said I would get an A so I had expected atleast an A- but somehow I managed to get an B- even though I hit all the criteria for the prompt (advisor also looked over to make sure i have what the prompt asked for).

Both are very hard and with confusing concepts. I’m assuming if you are transferring you are from community, but quarter systems here go by fast.

unless you spend 4hrs each day studying you will get cooked.

Midterms for 10A comes quick and is vigorous, and add 5 on top of that is going to be very challenging especially with adapting to the environment and distractions.

I have no idea why SB decided to recommend you take both in the same quarter, in my opinion they are setting you up for failure, it is almost comedic.

Split them up, take summer courses and make sure you actually read the book. Concepts are to Indept to learn through slides. READ THE BOOKS!!! 

Good luck guys, if I can help one person with this advice im happy!! 

All my transfer friends who took both are absolutely getting fried and are considering switching or dropping. 

If you want to do both go ahead, but if you want to play it safe just take 1. Good luck guys!

Hello I won’t be naming any names but I need some advice. Right now I am taking an American Politics class (won’t be naming the professor but to those who take Poli Sci this might be obv) and I am really struggling. To preface I’m an international student and this is my first time living in America and learning anything about American politics. Not using it as an excuse but I am still figuring out how the systems work here so I feel very  behind already in my class full of mostly American students who have taken APUSH or learnt about American history in high school. My professor had multiple bad reviews (1 * on ratemyprofessor)  but I still took the class because I need it to graduate on time. But now I truly regret it he is exactly what everyone said he was like, he is condescending and rude. And at first I was alright with it thinking things will be fine because my TA would be better. Wrong, my TA is not any better. He has started to target me in class as I don’t answer, which is fine because I know he wants me to engage but I am still learning the basics and he has grown to dislike me because I don’t know the answers to the questions he asks me. I try very hard and I never miss class but English is not my first language and it’s hard to keep up. A few days ago in section I was determined to participate in class so when my TA put up some questions I started to google what some words meant and put it in a translator so that I could hopefully answer. He picked on me to answer before I could translate what the question was specifically asking for and then yelled at me for being on my phone. I didn’t even have the chance to explain that I was just researching the question. I usually write down topics or words I don’t understand on my phone and go home and learn them but now I’m even too scared to do that. With my midterms coming up I feel defeated in performing well in this class. I’ve never done bad in a class and need to do well to keep my GPA requirement. Does anyone know anything I can do or anyone I can talk to, to get help or maybe report this behavior.

It will be totally safe and won't damage the device. It won't collect any information or data from the phone.

For more context, the feature is to mirror the display to an external monitor conntected with USB-C.
I have a portable monitor (Smartisan TNT go) that can work with my Samsung Galaxy S20, but doesn't work with my new Pixel 9.
However, it could be because I installed a custom ROM (GrapheneOS) on my Pixel 9,

Do you feel like everyone hates you and you don't understand why? Well this post is for you!  

If you identify yourself as a slow walker, instead of walking in the middle of the sidewalk, move out of the f\*\*\*ing way and place yourself on the edge of either side! There are people with places to be and your 3 inch strides are holding up everyone behind you. If people are constantly passing you and you find that there's always a gap of space in front of you, instead of being offended, move your big back to the side so people who walk faster than you can get to where they need to be. This goes for friend groups as well, your 3-6+ person friend group does not need to stretch horizontally across the entire side walk. Consolidate yourselves into rows so that people are capable of maneuvering around you. 

And I swear to god, the amount of times I've walked toward the direction of a group hogging the sidewalk and nobody moves to let me pass... The person approaching you should not have to walk into plants/dirt/roads with incoming cars to get around you and your inconsiderate friends. "

I’m sick of being scared if he’s on the bus and getting nervous everytime the bus makes a stop. I live in Santa Catalina so I NEED the bus. What should I do?

UPDATE: Im so touched by all the DMs and comments- EVERYTHINGS ALL GOOD NOW!!!:))) I followed your advice and the bus is now again a safe space for me 🥹"

I’d consider myself a bit of a gym rat, and I used to be proud of my physique…until I met him. He’s always walking around the house shirtless, which has made me feel a tad insecure, to say the least.

The other night, he brought his girlfriend over (who, frankly, might also be stronger than me). We were chatting, and they casually asked about my dating life. I was already feeling a bit jealous, so in a moment of panic, I blurted out that I had a girlfriend too. That was true at one point, but all my past relationships have ended thanks to my Warhammer 40k and League addiction.

Now, here’s where it gets tricky: his girlfriend suggested we should do a double date. Without thinking, I agreed, and now we’re set to go to Su’s Bowl on Thursday. After giving it some thought, I’ve come to the only logical conclusion: I need to find a fake girlfriend for this double date. And where better to turn than the UCSB Reddit?

I never use Uber Eats or any other delivery service at that. Everything is close, and I have a car, so I order takeout 99% of the time; however, now I would like to have my food delivered, that is, a smash burger with fried jalapeños and dill pickle from Mesa Burgers. Which brings me here.

As is, the burger starts out at a price of $15, which is outstanding. After I add my extras the price settles at $17.50 which is still outstanding. But I want it delivered, so Uber Eats it is. The menu through their portal list my burger at a starting price of $21, 23.50 with the adds. Makes sense. But then there are the taxes with the fees, the $2.00 health insurance thingamajig for the drivers, a $1.49 delivery fee, and a membership fee. So, $18.86 has accumulated to $29.13. 

My question is: am I expected to tip the driver, or are they compensated from the 54% price increase?

He hates the shelter and needs a calm, loving home ASAP. Nero loves people but needs to be the only dog in the home for now.

Study Room Etiquette,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1fvgkk4/study_room_etiquette/,215,14,2024-10-03 19:52:44,"**If you want to use a study room in the library, please reserve it ahead of time. If someone is already in the study room, please do not enter if the door is closed and you do not have a reservation.** 

For context, I reserved a study room today for a Zoom technical interview for a highly competitive entry-level position. I was dressed in business attire from the waist up, it should be clear what I’m doing to those passing by. 

During my interview, two separate people, \~20 minutes apart, tried to enter the room during my reserved time. Both asked if they could use the study room or if it was reserved. I tried giving them a ""go away"" hand gesture, but they kept insisting and trying to talk to me, despite me clearly being in the middle of an interview. Unfortunately, they didn't get the hint until I had to pause the interview twice to address them. I am worried this will hurt my application. 

I’ve never experienced this issue during internship interviews last year, so I’m assuming these individuals were new students, given that it’s only week one. 

If you're a Freshman, Transfer, or a new Graduate student, please be mindful of others using study rooms, whether it's for studying or interviews. Graduating and landing jobs is challenging for most people, so please reserve rooms ahead of time and respect others' reservations."

There is also a resource section that has direct links to everything from beneficial economic information from strong sources, important dates, and even help with meal planning. As a UCSB economics students myself, l had a hard time finding any sort of online help and hope as a community we can use one another to further our learning and understanding of the many topics we cover in Econ. Please feel free to send an email giving any advice on how we can further improve the site. If you are not an Econ student and decide to check it out and like it, please also let me know I can try to replicate it for a different major.
Hope you all find it helpful! Also just a note I’ve not gotten as much of a response from the community I’ve hoped for and am assuming it’s not been super helpful. As I’ve graduated now I will realistically close it out unless I see more utilization on the website. I hope it helps people and for the few who have, download all the content that will help you in studying for other Econ classes as well. I hope you all have a great school year!

All of you pledging Sig Pi will get fucked up terribly during the initiation at the end. It’s called I-72 because you’ll will be locked in a garage for 72 hours straight, not allowed to sleep, forced to eat gross shit like vinegar soaked onions, pissed on eggs and tobacco filled “pies” and throw it back up 100+ times, briefly released to swim in ocean in the middle of the night and then will be drugged at the end. The pledging process is difficult but nothing too bad for the whole quarter bc they are manipulating and tricking you. Absolutely demons, not metaphorical but literal are involved in this process to suck you into their traumatic cult. Endless amounts of milk, corn, and even water you will have to drink to the point that you will have to “pull trig” to keep going and eating. You will be pushed physical and mentally to the edge and this is purposely done to “break” you in. The “pledge father” told me specifically it was his goal to break me during this process. Went through it and it fucked me. They say you can leave but would have 6-7 dudes corner you and talk you into staying and getting hazed “for your brothers” and threaten that none of the friends you made would talk w you again if you left. They have a different way of torturing your pledge class every hour of the 72 hours they call them “events”. Not worth it they are psychopaths. If you know someone who’s doing it warn them. 


Oh, and their dumb little password they think is cool to keep secretive is “JEBO” and you have to go for a handshake and tap each others wrist w pointer finger while saying the letter and 1st guy says “J”, the other guy taps n says “E”, 1st taps n says “B” and other taps n says “O” and then 1st says “JEBO”, other says JEBO n then both say “JEBO” and they’ll let you in their parties bc it proves you’ve been “initiated”

Pathetic esoteric bullshit that should be exposed, hope y’all still in Isla Vista use it on them.

Find a D&D group in Santa Barbara,https://i.redd.it/fcu2r7n8uerd1.jpeg,14,0,2024-09-27 20:18:44,"My name is Chay Comas, and I catalog local tabletop gaming clubs for D&D, Miniature Wargaming, and Trading Card Games across the Central Coast of California in this free forever [newsletter](https://centralcoastgamecommunity.substack.com/p/gaming-clubs-geeky-events-local-news).

If you're looking for a tabletop club, or how to create one from the ground up, this issue is for you. This issue covers some big news about a couple of local game designers, how to find or organize a tabletop club,  features local artists, a local gamer keeping a 200+ year gaming tradition alive, a guide for organizing game clubs, and a special dedication to my father at the end.

## Excerpt:
```...Marshall Neal has been supporting local game conventions by running Kriegsspiel, a very historical wargame dating back to the 1800s as an officer training tool for the Prussian Army. Kriegsspiel is often referred to as the Great Grandfather of Dungeons & Dragons, as it led to more recent, and familiar, historical wargames like Napoleonic Wargames. The Napoleonic Wargames and other wargames of the 1960s and 1970s brought together the co-creators of Chainmail (Gary Gygax and Jeff Perren), which then inspired Dungeons & Dragons (Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax). Marshall has single-handedly kept the flame of Kriegsspiel alight on the Central Coast, as few still play locally. Though his international community on Discord thrives and often plays virtually, I wonder when the last in-person game will be played here on the coast...```

UCSB vs. UCI? (Economics),https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1fq3xn8/ucsb_vs_uci_economics/,5,25,2024-09-26 18:56:54,"Hey everyone,

I’m 22, working in marketing & data analytics with 5 years of experience and a total comp of $100K+. Born and raised in Orange County, I’m transferring as a 3rd-year student in Fall 2025. I’m torn between UCI and UCSB, and would love some input based on my circumstances:

UCI (Business Economics)
Pros:

- I could potentially keep my current job, which pays well and is important for my career trajectory.

- I’m already familiar with the area, which means less adjustment and stress.

- I could save a lot on rent by living at home.

- There are strong job opportunities in Irvine, so staying local might help build my network further.

- It’s a well-ranked UC, so the academic reputation is strong.

Cons:

- It feels like a continuation of the past few years, and I’m looking for more change.

- UCI is known as more of a commuter school, so I worry I might miss out on a better social life.

- I’ve spent my whole life here, and I’m feeling a bit tired of the area.

UCSB (Economics)
Pros:

- It’s right by the beach, and watching the sunset is one of my favorite things.

- Living in a college town where most people bike and live within a few blocks of each other sounds really appealing. It seems like a fun, close-knit community atmosphere.

- I want a more “traditional” college experience, and UCSB feels like it could provide that.

- I think going away for school could be a big opportunity for personal growth and stepping out of my comfort zone.

- I’m curious to explore UCSB’s party scene and experience that aspect of college life.

Cons:

- The Economics department seems really rigorous, and honestly, I’m not super confident in my academic abilities.

- I’m afraid I might not make friends as easily, and there’s a worry about feeling isolated or homesick being so far from home.

- Rent and housing costs are much higher in Santa Barbara, which is a concern with the current housing crisis.

- Leaving my job would mean taking a hit to my career progress and income.

- I’ll be 23 by the time I transfer, and I’m worried about feeling older than the average undergrad.

Any advice or personal experiences with either school would really help me out! Thanks so much :)"

It works for the entire local bus system. Lay it flat on the green glowy surface and it should beep when detected. If yours doesn’t work go here for the google form -> accessid.ucsb.edu 

1. Bus picks up a lot of people from sierra madre -> ft -> colegio rd. the closer you are to the campus the less likely you are to get on a bus in time during peak hours. 
2. Busses usually come within minutes of one another, and the same number bus cycles roughly every 20-30mins. Ex) if you missed bus 28 you’d wait about 18 mins to see it again at the same stop.
3. The 27 bus goes through IV therefore takes longer to get to campus.
4. Rainy days have more people than usual.
5. Busses can arrive early or late, a map app is your best guide for the estimated time 

Given a scenario: you live in ft and your class starts at 9:30am. The best way to guarantee you get to class on time is be at the bus stop around 9:00, because both busses 28 and 11 had just left at 08:52, and you’re very likely to get on the 27 bus at 09:08, or the next 28 bus at 09:10, or the 24 bus at 09:12. if you’re shit out of luck, a walk from ft to north hall is 30mins. 

These are just some of my own experiences taking the bus and if you have anything to add feel free to comment :))) Have fun on your first day!"

Questions regarding Professor Butch Ware,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1fpgdc1/questions_regarding_professor_butch_ware/,9,0,2024-09-25 21:51:54,"Hey, y'all. I am currently working on a [podcast episode](https://www.buzzsprout.com/760511) about the Jill Stein/Butch Ware presidential campaign and during my research found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/1bexw2m/history_burn_book/) from this sub-reddit that claimed Professor Ware had committed Title IX violations and had been inappropriate with students. 

I've been trying to find first hand accounts to confirm or rule out these claims for the past month or so, but have had no luck either way. So, this is kind of my hail mary. 

If anyone here can speak on Professor Ware, either as a former student, TA, or co-worker, I would love to hear from you. All conversations are assumed to be anonymous, unless you tell me otherwise. Thanks ahead of time."
